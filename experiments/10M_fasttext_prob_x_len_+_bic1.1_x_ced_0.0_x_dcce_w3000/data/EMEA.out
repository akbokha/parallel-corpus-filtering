&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ integrate themselves in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ecting solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;

bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
inj@@ ecting solution is applied to a quick control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ oral distur@@ ban@@ ces when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to one or the melting cup of patients which are being used with tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are similar to as@@ bili@@ fy , should be adjusted the dose of bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably affects especially as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ hi@@ amine play a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will prevent their recur@@ rence . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
&quot; the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia , or similar diseases , compared to a period of two hours with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operating dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that tied to ger@@ min@@ ted unrest with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies through , in order to examine how the body has absorbed the melting cup and the solution to the one . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with the inj@@ ecting solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms associated with symptoms than the patients received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , as@@ bili@@ fy reduced more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies . &quot;
bili@@ fy consum@@ es up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ ion@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting ( beats ) , symptom and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness ( swelling ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from moderate to serious man@@ ic episodes in patients who had overwhel@@ m@@ ous episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes had to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in comparison to the risks .
&quot; moreover , the committee joined the outcome that the benefits of inj@@ ecting problems in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission issued by the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate to serious man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly some man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independently of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient @-@ group , a lower initiation dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is eliminated from the combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of addic@@ tive behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased risk risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in comparison to other anti @-@ psych@@ otic cancer .
&quot; Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ac disease ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions , which are pre@@ disp@@ ose for mort@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood@@ thir@@ sty medicines ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ignant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which ended one year or less , there were occasional reports about treatment with Ari@@ z@@ bra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ nas@@ a@@ esthesia . &quot;
&quot; if in a case with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of late @-@ day expe@@ ditions should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient emerged signs and symptoms that hin@@ der on a m@@ ns , or in@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole in patients with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases should be applied in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states which are applied with scr@@ ap@@ ologists . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) associated with Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , there was a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the talk for unwanted tum@@ bl@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ ac@@ acia outlet or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otrop@@ ic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medication @-@ treated patients who allow direct comparisons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Pol@@ ur@@ ie , Pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , respectively an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with emerging side effects such as se@@ dation is taken ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ az@@ is Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric blood blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ p@@ ecting rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered as clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving healthy commis@@ sions a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) , AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ishment , the common application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common use of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail over the patient &apos;s potential risks . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV protein pe@@ ers , are likely to have similar effects and that is why similar dos@@ ages should be made . &quot;
&quot; after lowering the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be lifted to the dosage height before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 to be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole per day does not show any significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ p@@ hic ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for people and due to the concerns raised in the animal studies , this drug is not used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits be justi@@ fiable clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , patients should be warned against it , dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ z@@ bra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
&quot; the incidence of the below side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ z@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ om , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ operating dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % compared to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in a different controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients using O@@ lan@@ ov therapy . &quot;
some episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under semi @-@ operating HIV treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amoun@@ ted to 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term planning phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , revealed not medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; under@@ height of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ase Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side @-@ effects related to an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome occurs in connection with Ari@@ z@@ ys@@ z@@ ole , unwanted events and increased ster@@ ility in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch of market , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional over@@ dose of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death penalty . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ ost@@ asis in treating an over@@ dose of arith@@ me@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that ha@@ x@@ sis is in treating an over@@ dose of benefits since Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole has a high plas@@ tic@@ ap@@ ron . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ z@@ bra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder on the combination of a particip@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ c recept@@ ors and a antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is conve@@ yed .
Ari@@ pi@@ anist presented in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
&quot; in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy people , the Pos@@ it@@ ents @-@ E@@ missions interface showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the condition of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otrop@@ ic symptoms .
&quot; in a semi @-@ operating study , 52 the share of respon@@ dents in a semi @-@ operating study was in 52 the share of respon@@ dents , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ Oper@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ als , which were defined as secondary study , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with semi @-@ operating dol . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia showed himself a significantly higher reduction of relap@@ sing that lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole Group and 57 % below placebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ ov controlled , multinational dual @-@ blind study with schizophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study of weight ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approx . 6 kg ) . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole one compared to placebo over placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ id and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ ot@@ eric characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to placebo over placebo over placebo over placebo over a week 12 and a sof@@ tening effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operating dol . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed out a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on such as lithium or semi @-@ operating dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otrop@@ ic symptoms , that partly over 2 weeks did not respond to Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study followed over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term exp@@ ir@@ ation phase for 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase , predominantly in preventing a bi@@ polar return when preventing a relap@@ se into man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for the stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ len@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle Eli@@ min@@ ation period is less than 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole in exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ ishment by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ishment by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy people , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients were not gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
an important @-@ specific analysis to the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not notice any indication of a clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking on the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy people .
&quot; a single dosage trial at Pro@@ ban@@ den with several eng@@ radi@@ ator liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function to the phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole and el@@ de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ aci@@ dity , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , reproduction , reproduction , and can@@ cer@@ genic potential left the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any particular danger to the human being . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ology significant effects were observed merely in doses or ex@@ positions which have clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to men , so they have limited liability for clinical use only limited or no meaning . &quot;
the effects embr@@ aced a dose of tri@@ renal glands ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ sis ) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ X of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis between humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ ic@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of spra@@ ying sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ation of hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 3@@ 1@@ times of the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the human G@@ alle in the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ z@@ bra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and lie far below the limit ( 6 % ) of vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; with rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to the ex@@ positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ h of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier received an anth@@ rac@@ ation in the past . &quot;
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all types or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug containing a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with my@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in conventional medicines . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , with patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators , that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it must not be applied to patients who have low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ sers in the blood before starting the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the first treatment is no longer harmon@@ ised , effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that it has to be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission shared the company on behalf of Bio@@ Science Limited approved a permit for the transport of my@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; my@@ op@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is inf@@ ested and is not shown for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;

&quot; in case of sensory N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to break down , until an improvement in degree 1 or 2 is reached , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
my@@ op@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data about uncertainty and effectiveness .

women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with my@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ tion method .
&quot; male patients treated with x@@ ane will be treated , while and up to six months after the treatment no child will bear witness . &quot;
male patients should be advised before the treatment on a sperm reduction as it consists of the treatment with my@@ x@@ ane the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; my@@ op@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the basis of transport and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; below are the most common and main incidents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ atology toxicity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia has been reported in 71 % of patients .

p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ gran@@ ules which promotes the con@@ storage of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the semin@@ al indi@@ cus and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their land@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a im@@ itation of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ glob@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ into the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ components in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells was medi@@ ated and proved as part of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ bel@@ ax@@ el promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ dot@@ al transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ tor is conve@@ yed and occurs due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein acid in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the realm of tum@@ ors .
&quot; the application of my@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two introductory studies and 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison study . &quot;
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ el@@ oma , containing 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ dation to preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) , or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; when recording in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ro@@ es and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ alli@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ alli@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ alli@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;

&quot; • Training bro@@ sch@@ ure • summary of the characteristics of the medication by means of medical information ) , lab@@ eling and Pack@@ ages . • The unique imaging of the correct application of the product hand@@ crafted refriger@@ ation for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; Re@@ ference Manual &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood levels , where in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications could occur if before the procedure is not possible to expect a blood bleeding from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is shown .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; injection may also be made by the patient or its supervis@@ ors , provided they have received an appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ mo@@ bell levels should always be in an recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to verify , to ensure that no iron lack exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or thus that the body is not enough on the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby dimin@@ ish the result of a loss of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which they are promoted to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene within the framework of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a V@@ ene before they were re @-@ placed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the modification of hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin@@ s between the beginning of the study and the evaluations period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also outlined the results of a study where the effects caused by the skin of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients were examined .
&quot; in the study involving patients , caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ mo@@ bell turbines were questioned in the same degree as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output of 12,@@ 0 g / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ mon@@ est side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , steady mig@@ raine headaches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ ab@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ ab@@ amed as inj@@ ecting among the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that herein is triggered by no allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee on Human Rights Agency ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence , the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed company , will provide information personnel in all Member States information , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
August 2007 the European Commission of Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg shared approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .

&quot; patients who undergo a larger electric orthop@@ edic surgery should have adequate thro@@ mbo@@ genic prophy@@ la@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ am@@ bot@@ any and vas@@ cular disease , particularly in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that in case of treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa used for patients with a starting @-@ mo@@ ver of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post@@ operative anthrop@@ ic / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;

&quot; there is an increased risk of anthrop@@ ic events in tum@@ ours , which are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic adult poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results were applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ly er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ ours patients who are treated with chemotherapy , because a few patients included with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the standard range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which is further back to another treatment . &quot;
your doctor will be given regular blood tests to insp@@ ect the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of Iron deficiency , resolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ mol@@ y@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fol@@ ine deficiency , should be taken into account and before the start of the therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;

&quot; if you suffer under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie , it will break your therapy with se@@ ab@@ amed and define how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting in a V@@ ene ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of a disease due to a kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ mo@@ bell is worth the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the mortality could be increased .
&quot; for increased or increasing pot@@ assium , your doctor can consider a break in treatment with se@@ amed into consideration , until the pot@@ assium is again within the standard range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer chronic kidney dil@@ uted and clin@@ ically apparent coron@@ ary heart disease , your doctor will make sure your h@@ mo@@ bell mirror is not exceeding a certain value . &quot;
&quot; after the present findings , due to the treatment of blood poverty with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( renal in@@ suffici@@ ency ) that are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 your doctor will regularly define your values of the red blood supply ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) , and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of a blood cell formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic event ) as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa events , e.g. if you are an increased risk of thro@@ am@@ ic@@ ir@@ cular vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have already been obes@@ e vas@@ cular events ( such as a deep Ven@@ en@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ onia ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed act like a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances the tum@@ our can have a negative impact . &quot;
&quot; if you are able to achieve greater orthop@@ edic surgery , prior to treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values are too high in the red blood @-@ off ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood ton@@ ing after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines and have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( means for the repression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will apply certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory studies have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) are a means to build the immune system ( e.g. cancer or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ a@@ emia ) speaks to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will be appropriate to arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment results and make sure that the drug works properly and does not sur@@ pass your hem@@ ost@@ bell not worth a certain value .
&quot; once you are set up well , you get regular doses from Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice weekly , spread over two equal injections . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following illnesses : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , which is br@@ ittle bone ) both in women and in men . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tional risk ( bone break@@ ings ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a slight trau@@ matic break @-@ down like the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ wing , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with ret@@ ables should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( agent against inflammation ) just after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms reflected in the three days of in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
&quot; for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for Z@@ om@@ eta was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine @-@ frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the salary of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance ) in the blood decreases again and decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ ebr@@ ates was reduced by patients among A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients below placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients , under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with ret@@ ables , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs acid or other mus@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all mus@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to cancer at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a the risk of kidney failure , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides information material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information how to apply the medicine , as well as the similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug can be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis , a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip re@@ frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long @-@ emission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patient with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 is i.e. an oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ ular vitamin D recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by offering acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney disorder ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended that there are limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age as data are absent or efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because for these patient population only limited clinical experiences exist .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ an@@ a@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick setup of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c on the bone structure , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ cr@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patient with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed a dental examination with appropriate prevention of dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental attacks , no data are available whether the interruption of the treatment with tick @-@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the oral field . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and be based on an individual use risk assessment .
&quot; the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by offering acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency used as a serious side @-@ effect used by pre @-@ hoped was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of anticip@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.2 % ) and placebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , unwanted pharmaceutical effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney clean@@ se Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the renal function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ins ) and in rare cases considered an acute kidney failure .
the modification of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annually measured against administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were in a clinical trial with oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was diagnosed with 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory studies the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic values created below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial @-@ treated patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post @-@ visual oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoidance of clinical questionn@@ aires after a frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avoidance of clinical questionn@@ aires , the vitamin D @-@ C were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the oral field occasionally became , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the j@@ aw area ) reports that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ate , including customs acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the j@@ aw area near an A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and with a placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cr@@ ine disease , can be obtained through gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium intake . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown with either a bone function or a BM@@ D score for the Schengen passport or a BM@@ D @-@ T for the Schengen passport or without signs of existing spinal body .
effects on morph@@ ometric vert@@ ebr@@ ates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significant over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ ebr@@ ates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older have decreased by 60 % decreased risk of spinal body fat compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on pot@@ assium frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed an equal lasting effect over three years that resulted in a decreased risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI ) by 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip sculptures .
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised the bone density at the steering rack , hip , and the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significant at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase in bone density of lum@@ bar spine for 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip of 6.@@ 0 % , of the gift of 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.@@ 2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology with 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis that were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone mar@@ mal@@ op@@ sies from the pelvic player .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the traditional bone @-@ volume and the preservation of traditional bone architecture .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the output until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept under 52 % below the output until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the output until 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D @-@ level were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received a given dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ ular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
overall ag@@ ul@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in the total and gift weight as at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment at an increase in BM@@ D around 5.@@ 4 % in total and around 4.3 % of the gift .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 50@@ 8 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged by 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical questionn@@ aires in men ; the incidence of clinical questionn@@ aires was 7.5 % at as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % for placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was compared to once weekly offering of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at compared to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the output value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ wing A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ ms @-@ specific upper standard for recording in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg customs acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months studies .
&quot; in the combined results , after 6 months a similar decrease of pain and pain rel@@ ics was observed in comparison with the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
&quot; patients , who were classified as the responsible study at the end of the six month @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) , could be absorbed into an observ@@ able phase . &quot;
&quot; from 143 to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who treated at the observation study , the therapeutic approach could be treated in 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 who treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients , aged 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg customs acid in 64 patients received the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plastic bar increased rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the top value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the top value . &quot;
&quot; quick bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ical disappearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a tempor@@ al Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 14@@ 6 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early mat@@ ing phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ called ½ values ) represent probably the rapid res@@ isting in bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clearance - concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration on time ) . &quot;
&quot; reduced clearing of through Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ atic substances are unlikely , because customs acid in humans are not metabo@@ li@@ zed and because they are a f@@ aint or even direct and / or irreversible , hydrogen @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patients groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of customs acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and amoun@@ ted to the 64 examined patients in funding 84 ± 29 ml / min ( area 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
it results in that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disease up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of customs acid .
&quot; because for heavy kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxicity The highest not let@@ al intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose was in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at R@@ atten 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , individual doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ times of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ dition . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intraven@@ ous application has been given the renal compatibility of bon@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid at R@@ atten , altogether 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which is equivalent to the 6@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , compared to the 7@@ 0s of the human therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated extru@@ sions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , the toxic@@ ological effects associated with other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal epitheli@@ um and the liver , as well as at intraven@@ ous inj@@ ecting location . &quot;
&quot; the most common sense of studies with repeated application was a multip@@ ly primary spontane@@ ity in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a report that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ resor@@ tive effect of substance . &quot;

&quot; customs acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ant which is called mus@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get &apos;s bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially estrogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in a rather gradual loss of bone mass , that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is inserted un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by putting the bone structure again norm@@ alized , ensuring a normal bone formation and gives the bones once more strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to be subject to any dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff if you take other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs , known by which it is the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a along with food and drinks , you are worried that you take sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broke out the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip . &quot;
mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a V@@ ene .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you will need to require a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it &apos;s important to follow these instructions exactly to follow the calcium mirror in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
when the administration was missed by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Set@@ zen you &apos;ll get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new appointment .
&quot; before ending the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a If you &apos;re considering ending the treatment with as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s min and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions are less frequent .
&quot; fever and sho@@ ok , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff , if any of the listed effects you have significantly affected or you will notice side effects which are not listed in this manual information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should be exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to make two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip replacement . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be supplied sufficiently with fluid ; this is especially important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the quick setup of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patient with mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ired low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or@@ ale or in@@ tram@@ us@@ ular vitamin D is recommended in front of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al Survey ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which the studies carried out by the Committee on Human Rights Agency ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to reach recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos are applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( Mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes treatment ) can be applied together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug medicine ( dual therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; it can also be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , which can be adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ous or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine or insulin can be maintained except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( lower blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ines or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s body can be upgraded better in better , and the blood sugar level decreases , thus reducing type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ade , in addition they received either accounts or placebo up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; accounts led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible that the blood sugar intake has been reduced by doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional gift from accounts for existing treatment showed met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ade in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values at 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insulin is examined in at 2@@ 89 patients , patients who added accounts in addition to insulin , reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to accounts were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and hypo@@ esthesia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be applied to patients who may possibly respond sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic ket@@ ac@@ acia outlet - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ ross is used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited announces a permit for the transport of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is dis@@ continued with insulin or in@@ compatibility with which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former coron@@ ary heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or eyel@@ ash , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and eyel@@ ash to be observed if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of age 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , however , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output identi@@ enz@@ ym@@ eric ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror up to the 3 @-@ times of the upper limit of the standard range are increased the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are as soon as possible to control again .
&quot; if a patient symptoms develops , point out on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , Ober@@ bau@@ ch@@ marking , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker Har@@ n , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic are to be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one continues , should be guided by the assessment of the lab parameters of the clinical evaluation . &quot;
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected by fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with a hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a hem@@ ost@@ al membrane the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one joined a low @-@ level reduction in the middle hem@@ mo@@ bell levels ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ mat@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ bell level around 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ mat@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ mat@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitivity , in patients , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale two @-@ way or three @-@ way combination therapy with insulin , maintain the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after launch a market launch has been reported below the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , over an occurrence , or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ o@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients should report about interference of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
&quot; in a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of announcements of unwanted events in random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years , with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative @-@ drug . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years to the investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires from 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ) treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) were treated with patients with a comparison table . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be filed ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on the pharmaceutical drugs or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ ma@@ zi@@ l ( one cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( one cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulting in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance , thus reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( out of present data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the gymn@@ g@@ ors and the brake rod of the lens , as it also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents joined the triple of the upper limit of the standard in comparison to placebo , however rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ide . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced la@@ vas@@ cular disease the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was to 1,6 % higher than among placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since market launch has rarely been reported via cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; it became a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of announcements of unwanted events in random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and more than 7.@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ atively medi@@ ate @-@ treated groups . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 @-@ year @-@ active pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires played at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative @-@ drug . &quot;
&quot; in taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to be an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ di@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ zer Rec@@ ep@@ tor ) ) which results in the animal model to increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral ranking in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ ders ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eable study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was random@@ ized despite three @-@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optimization phase with insulin , to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - worth 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to receive only insulin ; a reduction of insulin gene in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been observed . &quot;
clinical studies over a year showed a significant statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the output value .
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week examination of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma @-@ gly@@ cer@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , however clin@@ ically not significantly enhanced L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years of reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the overall plas@@ tic@@ ine and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ ols . &quot;
compared to placebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level observed during met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values .
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber @-@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de level but improved in addition the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de level as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic synthesis .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy . &quot;
&quot; after oral application pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one gets absorbed quickly , with the top @-@ con@@ centric pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma generally 2 hours after application can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ actions studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ ma@@ zi@@ l ( one cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( one Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ duc@@ tor ) or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ edly Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the Mark@@ er is mainly found in f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and a lower scale in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean Plasma Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours when people are 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma @-@ concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy pro@@ ban@@ ds , with the ration@@ ale of the oral clearing of the parent substance . &quot;
&quot; in to@@ xi@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and ape tuning according to repeated administration of plastic , an@@ a@@ emia , an@@ emia , and rever@@ sible cardi@@ ac tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one who dimin@@ ished in the creation of hyper@@ insulin @-@ emia and increased insulin resistance , thus decreases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
in an animal @-@ model of the family @-@ aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of colon@@ iz@@ ers .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years , with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative @-@ drug . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years to the investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires from 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 frac@@ tures treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ) treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) were treated with patients with a comparison table . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
clinical studies over 1 year showed a significant statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ as compared to the output value .
in a study over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber @-@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de level but improved in addition the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de level as well as on the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ license synthesis .
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the target with respect to its primary end@@ point , a combination of the overall ag@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium , stroke , anti @-@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arteries , put the results close that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not associated with cardiovascular health risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane was tested in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human plan . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ic ( r@@ DNA ) , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the packing base ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes towards the risks ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
&quot; the inj@@ ecting needle must be loaded under the skin at least 6 seconds , in order to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly for example by a intensified insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change with regard to strength , brand ( maker ) , Insul@@ in@@ ty@@ p ( quickly real , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic , long @-@ causing insulin ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin in animal origin ) may result in that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if you change a dosage adjustment to the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions reported after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician since such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be taken or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask for his patients getting involved in other medicines .
&quot; 4 So@@ y hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ abet@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of abnorm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients who have already demonstrated signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or po@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater jungle cryst@@ all@@ ations , which can lead to artic@@ ular and bone damages ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary seal is still more than 6 mg per de@@ x@@ ite , the dose may be increased at once daily 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there are still toxicity incidents ; therefore , it is recommended that patients have at least take effect during the first six months of treatment with the aden@@ ur@@ ic nor additional medicines to preventing gyp@@ sies . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation because it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three of different Adenauer &apos;s dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to a placebo ( hypo@@ drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hypertension ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to 300 mg every day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ureth@@ ra lay down in the blood at the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , which took place in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took once daily 120 mg once daily in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the reduction in the ur@@ inary tract under the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but it could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hypertension related to diseases , who have already led to pri@@ mor@@ dial trials ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present chemical sp@@ leen and / or a gyp@@ sy ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um sa@@ wing machine after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x every day .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people there are no experiences with children and young people , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; transplan@@ ts Rec@@ ei@@ vers received no experience in organizing transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with metastatic cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ compensated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended for treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

liver diseases Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed light abnorm@@ alities of the liver function compared with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at patients treated ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s , and in the further course depending on the clinical fund to perform a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was were not carried out any exchange studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ shirt can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a dose of the Met@@ abol@@ ishment of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .

pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be excluded from side @-@ effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ations on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal &apos;s experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the control of a vehicle , serving machines or the exercise of dangerous activities , until they can be quite certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be affected by their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the investig@@ ator reported cardiovascular events was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e@@ group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term study studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and no significant connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ attack or a de@@ compensated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , and which were reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once reported are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no heavy skin strikes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term studies in the open long @-@ term studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term studies were similar to those in the Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in a total of more than once , and presented with patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients ) . &quot;

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ emia and tox@@ ins . &quot;
the primary efficacy point was in every study the percentage of patients with which the last three month @-@ month @-@ bag @-@ bag &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ rate to study course of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superiority in terms of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

the lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit to week 2 and maintain permanently over the entire treatment .
&quot; 50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um@@ car@@ in@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function constra@@ ining The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function constra@@ int ( i.e. , h ) . &quot;
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point was reached by 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in percentage of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in the group , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations of 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had to study classes ( Bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 found a treatment against a gyp@@ sum ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of pl@@ itude size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the toxicity until month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) have been observed in patients who received a long term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term studies . &quot;

&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is bigger than the dos@@ is@@ proportionate increase . &quot;
&quot; after a intake of simple or multi @-@ payment doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change observed in percentage decline of ser@@ um @-@ acid @-@ concentrations observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the sculpture from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to album ) and is reached via the concentration of concentration , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies for human @-@ liver micro@@ som@@ ing showed that these oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ pose metabolic and pri@@ ori@@ zation and for clinical use as un@@ relevant .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproduction power of male and female rats .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE will be used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one illness , where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vitamins , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which is to take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company received data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to em@@ ulate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D sp@@ ans .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D was treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who captured exclusively Al@@ ac@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also placed data that is required in the dose that is required in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose exactly the dose , which is required to prevent a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus ( pu@@ ff@@ les ) , ul@@ cer , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( ultra@@ violet ) , ul@@ cer ( ultra@@ violet ) , tum@@ ul@@ cer ( blo@@ wer abdom@@ en ) as well as su@@ ck stir . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other ingredients may not be applied for AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand tall or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission announces the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; D@@ oh@@ me Ltd . approval for the supply of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; cap @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a button on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage or inser@@ tion of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following hints are to be followed precisely to reduce the risk for solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swal@@ lowed up by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not go before the first food intake of the day , which is to take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions at the upper guest @-@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , can be given only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , like Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of alleg@@ ations ( partially these were severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore alert to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible solution @-@ ha@@ ired reactions , and patients should be cau@@ tioned to locate the occurrence of symptoms @-@ ha@@ ired irritation or new , or more lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn the medication and get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe os@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who perform the medicine correctly and / or it according to the occurrence of symptoms , point out onto a solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all the automation instructions are passed on to patients and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ occupied clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk was established , there were rarely ( after launch ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy ime is primarily administered by Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give the hints , whether the inser@@ tion of a Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ry therapy in patients who require a ortho@@ don@@ tic surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose to the j@@ aw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor is relevant for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet at the next morning taking notice of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their om@@ issions .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on this week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated before the onset of treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ ac@@ tional studies were not carried out , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies were taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy that identify embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports come from cancer patients , but it also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
nevertheless the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ um got up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic equation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was proven in a one @-@ year @-@ multic@@ enter study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and questionn@@ aires in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) , as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention ( FIT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) . &quot;
in Phase III studies the mid @-@ phase studies carried the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine . 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % on the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
&quot; in comparison to the placebo group , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.@@ 2 % compared to placebo 6.@@ 2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffered , one or more vert@@ ebr@@ ations suffered . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ini@@ ous and of the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ controlled trials , which was consumed on daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily in either 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily gift of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least a new spine to 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; the bio@@ availability decreased according to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % , if al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ym was effective if at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day was taken . &quot;

9 distribution studies of rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed in Wei@@ cht@@ eil@@ les after intraven@@ ous Gift of 1 mg / kg but then quickly distributed in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active marked substance were retired within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects . &quot;
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance reaches not 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is left with rats not over the su@@ ck or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects men &apos;s ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;
&quot; results For healthy adult people ( women and men ) was after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE according to noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting , and two hours before recording a meal the average area under the Ser@@ um concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6,@@ 4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without consideration of endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 mirror ) . &quot;

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients where a kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent a rep@@ ent of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , using the use of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
main indi@@ k@@ ator of effectiveness was the number of patients where the transplan@@ tation was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of a year ( by example examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
&quot; in addition , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were carried out with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other ingredients may not be applied Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , since the Ad@@ vaginal dose or the dose of the same can be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

&quot; only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should make this medicine re@@ arrange , or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ ts or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ isation . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the narro@@ wer control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a shift to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to make sure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual case and on blood levels , see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level mirror should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a valley level , with both formulations both in kidney and le@@ ased patients . &quot;
me@@ tic@@ ulous and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure proper substance exposure to the immediate im@@ transp@@ l@@ ation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vaginal Dos@@ age can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient permits in the first post @-@ operative phase no oral intake of drugs , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations to produce a in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated by a dose of ca . &quot;
the duration of the application Z@@ ur suppression of the transplan@@ tation must be maintained by the immune system ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation Acc@@ or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adap@@ tations may be required later since the phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ ine@@ tics can change from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation Acc@@ or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a must @-@ receiver of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf be converted , so this change has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant after a shift from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily must start treatment with each in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation With adult patients who are converted on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transp@@ l@@ ant receiver has no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ ul@@ as@@ - and col@@ ates transplan@@ ts patients , came in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.1 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
&quot; Dos@@ age customiz@@ ations in special patients groups . patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood cells in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , a reduction of the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of renal function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ureth@@ ra ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf When switching from an Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in- to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley level in full blood the dose should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in an individual case with the helpl@@ ess of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ si controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level mirror during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood pressure levels from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ age adap@@ ation , changes to immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at simultaneous application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ thorou@@ gh@@ ts@@ ation . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vaginal raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies can be concluded that successful treatment in most cases is possible , when the level of the blood levels will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the valley levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in ad@@ renal and heart transplan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent awakening therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , were generally used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ts or other side effects which may occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wer control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which has been proven to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapies , are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ ts of transplan@@ ts at adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts , there are no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a de@@ preci@@ ation of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is the intake of herbal supplements that prevent cur@@ rant herbs ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant healing during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood provided , since the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases it was viewed with Pro@@ gra@@ f as a cardi@@ ac disease , or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ y , which therefore can also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver functions , infections , hydr@@ ation and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection by using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who show the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pris@@ es like headaches , changing consciousness levels , scrat@@ ches and visual disorders , should a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; da Ad@@ vaginal Hart@@ mut , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , is available in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ t@@ arian gal@@ act@@ ose intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose absorption particular caution . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the con@@ current form of substances , which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolic metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
a strongly distinctive interaction was produced with An@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol and the Macro@@ lid An@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV pro@@ eas@@ ants ( z ) .
&quot; Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the rise in the blood levels mainly due to the elevated bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ priced pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute contrac@@ tion operations , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medications tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , metabolism of metabolism . &quot;
&quot; because tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thereby increase the hormone exposure , when decisions about receptive de@@ war@@ ting measures can be particularly cautious . &quot;
the results of animal trials have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ agr@@ bar@@ bit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients does not provide an indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants an elevated risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; at uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the newborn effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is recommended ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a Hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 newborn , i.e. : &quot;
the additional profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants is often due to the atrocities of patients and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects after their incidence appears in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on the data available is not identifiable ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and parasi@@ tic diseases How well @-@ known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants is treated with patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility for infections ( viral , bacterial , proto@@ zo@@ ale ) frequently . &quot;
cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated with immun@@ os@@ immun@@ otherapy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ therapy including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
it has been reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ignant Ne@@ oplas@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated lymp@@ h diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ one can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level are likely to convey the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependence of signal reduction due to signal reduction due to the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the trans@@ cription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ om@@ kin genes .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ conditioned , con@@ genital blood disorder ) . &quot;
dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether an Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been produced , which led to the formation of the human blood factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate is approved by another in the European Union called Re@@ fraction , similarly , is otherwise produced , so that medicines does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children less than six years , the application of the drug was examined by means of the prevention of bleeding , as well as in surgical procedures . &quot;
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate was awarded in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tum with &apos; excellent &apos; or &apos; good &apos; .
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human blood factor VIII , Maus@@ or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other constitu@@ ents . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission issued by the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to approve the approval for the advent of Adv@@ entures in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy are directed according to the severity of the factor VIII @-@ defect , according to the place and extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
in the following mor@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VIII activity is to sink to the specified period of time ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) will be repeated for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years of age ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , it is recommended to control the dose of the dose and the frequency of injections , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma seal . &quot;
individual patients may be able to distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII to achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 percent of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not dominated by adequate dose , a test must be performed to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so other therapeutic interventions must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the submission speed is to be set after the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of the factor VIII focused ignorance G Imm@@ ap@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that can be quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) pro ml plasma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position@@ ists is most of the largest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; the patients treated ( PT@@ Ps ) treated with more than 100 ex @-@ positioning and an@@ am@@ nesty , according to conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A on women , the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation are no experience . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients who had a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on the data available is not identifiable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of the patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . b ) The unexpected waste of the blood flow factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE @-@ In@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting has been maintained throughout the time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values at the 15 post@@ operative day .
&quot; in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed serious to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII below 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low In@@ d@@ hi@@ bit@@ ti@@ ter ( 2,@@ 4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there was no one of 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 and diagnosed as moderate exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously not treated patients of an ongoing clinical study formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE , patients In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , against a factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed through the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ surge against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise however no signs or symptoms included in an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients was isolated by the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes with several repeated production positions within the study . &quot;

this is a type of virus that genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; when the virus in Adv@@ ant@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; that has been changed so that there are no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ant@@ in could have been pr@@ istine directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the not broken in the human body contained p@@ 53 @-@ Gen , is usually used to restore or kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , with which the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen is broken , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company placed data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sau@@ cer , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP , the answers of the company had checked the answers to him , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;

according to the CH@@ MP was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of Adv@@ entures in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for the patient .
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the way of administration , and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not take note of CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Com@@ ing Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ant@@ in . &quot;
changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective constitu@@ ents immediately and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len produced inflammation of the nose @-@ paths ) in patients with nas@@ al cor@@ ne@@ al swelling ( pet@@ ted nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the no@@ stri@@ ps ( obstruc@@ ted nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be attributed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effici@@ ents were the changes of the severity of the ha@@ y fever reported by the patients prior to the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment were reported .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all the ha@@ y symptoms of symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze recorded , above a decrease of symptoms associated with 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al cor@@ nea was considered , the patients under aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed an reli@@ eving the symptoms around 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ i ( Herz@@ il@@ ess@@ ness ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis , psych@@ op@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( throat weakness ) , acc@@ ru@@ ation , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may possibly hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against des@@ ci@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseudo @-@ eph@@ one or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for treating allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients suffering from a shortage of lab@@ yrin@@ thine ( raised water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( over@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have already caused a mur@@ ky stroke of bacteria ( caused by brain bleeding ) or have a risk for a mur@@ ky stroke . &quot;
on 30 July 2007 the European Commission of the SP Europe opened a licence for the transport of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low it all in the whole ( i.e. without being sm@@ elling , to break or che@@ wing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound effects of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of application to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after ending such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other Vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors , Per@@ go@@ lid , Cab@@ erg@@ y@@ amin , Cab@@ erg@@ y@@ amin , Phen@@ yl@@ le@@ Phr@@ an , Eph@@ esi@@ y@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ y@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient in order to describe appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient in order to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment at the appearance of a hyper@@ ton@@ ie or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a strengthening of head@@ ache ) needs to be dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , care is advised : • Pati@@ ents among D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac disease ( patients with hypertension ) in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is to prevent at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ologically tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce them to extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes to the plasma @-@ concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests were not able to determine significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether distill@@ ation was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme used for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines could not be ruled out quite out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate or an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
the in@@ conceivable use of the use of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies but does not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the incidence of the population .
&quot; since reproduction studies are not always transferred to humans on humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ ical properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated about that in very rare cases it may come to a ben@@ evol@@ ence that can lead to an impairment of transport and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a T@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , staircase , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; headaches , anxiety , frightened mi@@ xes , muscle weakness and increased muscle tone , euph@@ oria , diar@@ rhe@@ a , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea , vom@@ iting , Tinnitus , axi@@ om , visual dys@@ functions or hyp@@ ot@@ ie or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; an Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as ather@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ ness , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , Hau@@ ther@@ mia , and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ voc@@ or@@ ical cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / ba@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hä@@ sion@@ ist P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose of dose with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
controlled clinical trials was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day by no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further person@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifestations of an implant arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s , where 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total body for the symptom ( except nas@@ al s@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the ab@@ ell@@ ular effect determined by the nas@@ al cor@@ ne@@ al swelling was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
in the context of a single dose study on the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze there is des@@ i@@ at@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma .
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in healthy pro@@ ban@@ den more than 14 days , the flow weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 reached . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ o@@ cular multi@@ disciplinary study study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult people , was found that four Pro@@ ban@@ den Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in badly mis@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; an extension study indicates that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the all@@ u@@ ated gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ accumulative was to the exposure to the gift of an aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ aci@@ dity , for toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , for Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in does not recognize any particular danger to the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination also had no greater toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive medical studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in the oral gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a d@@ osing of up to 120 mg / kg / day non ter@@ ato@@ genic . &quot;
&quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application process described pharmac@@ eu@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works , before and while the product is on the market . &quot;

&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for one ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2,5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ integrate themselves in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0,5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children from six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the p@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ month treatment . &quot;
&quot; there were further studies submitted to em@@ ulate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to one and the melting tables in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease in the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the symptom after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission of the SP Europe opened for approval by A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for reli@@ eving the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience of clinical studies for effectiveness in applying Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in to young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease follow @-@ up and can be completed after the sound of the symptoms and at their re@@ encounter .
in persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( incidence of symptoms 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during the aller@@ ist time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been determined within the framework of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets when er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not ampli@@ fied by as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it can come to ben@@ evol@@ ence , which can lead to an impairment of transport and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic judg@@ ments , have been reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently encountered side effects caused by the more common than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ ness ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect headaches , these occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ specialist study , administered by up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ voc@@ or@@ ical cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / ba@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hä@@ sion@@ ist P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ specialist , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ times the clinical dose ) has been administered for over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose of dos@@ ages with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ iness , Trentino , and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of the symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall assessment of the questionnaire concerning the quality of life of the quality of life of Rhino and vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the burden caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology regardless of the equ@@ in@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ an@@ tic diseases , it is expected that des@@ hip ar@@ ad@@ in besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria is also confirmed in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of sheets at the end of the first dosage inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka with chronic idi@@ opathic judg@@ ments , the minority of patients , who re@@ acted not to Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement in the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growing as well as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable .
&quot; in a pharmaceutical research study , in which the patients de@@ grades were comparable with the general seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , was achieved in 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant grief after once daily use of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; the enzyme used for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme was not yet identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate or an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg total meals ( fatty , cold breakfast ) do not have the availability of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
the clinical trials conducted with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for a comparable degree of exposure from Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in relation to the toxicity of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ aci@@ dity , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in no particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; colored movie ( contains l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ oton@@ ous , titan@@ ium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba@@ wax , geb@@ lei@@ gh wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , for reli@@ eving the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years of age ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical research and corresponding laboratory and skin examination . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years of metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher burden @-@ load ( see below Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years old , the restricted metabolic rate , is identical to those with children who are normal . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ type absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine do not take this medicine . &quot;
&quot; clinical relevant interactions were not determined within the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was not ampli@@ fied by as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of the side @-@ effects among children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies involving adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic judg@@ ments , have been reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ specialist study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
&quot; children between the ages of 1 and 11 years old , which came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic judg@@ ments and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar can the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults to the children &apos;s population are extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated .
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ specialist in adults and adolescents , which was applied in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ times of the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days at adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was found no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg led ast@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies , no impairment of psych@@ omot@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induc@@ ed power @-@ induc@@ ement even to an increase in sle@@ ep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; in an adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ iness , Trentino and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the palate . &quot;

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of sheets at the end of the first dosage inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ o@@ cular parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ examination study with the sy@@ up@@ form of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a time @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
&quot; there is no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant ingredient , for once daily use of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days for adults and adolescents . &quot;
12 In various single @-@ dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults that received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

&quot; immediately before the application the bl@@ ister has to be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ ate should be taken from , without damaging it . &quot;
&quot; clinical relevant interactions were not found within the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were also applied ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic judg@@ ments , have been reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets containing placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ specialist study , in which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical doses ) have been applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single @-@ dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , Vit@@ al@@ mark and E@@ KG @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all@@ data . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ specialist , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days has been applied , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ times the clinical dose ) was used over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
controlled clinical trials was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day by no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
&quot; in a 17 single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , itch and redness of the eyes and itch of the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall assessment of the questionnaire concerning the quality of life of the quality of life of Rhino and vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the burden caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

there are limited experience of clinical studies for effectiveness in applying Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in to young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before the application the bl@@ ister has to be carefully opened and the dose of the melting shop will be taken , without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and efficacy of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects between the Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was the same and turned not significantly from the safety profile made in adult patients .
at the recommended dose the A@@ eri@@ us melt @-@ coated tablet as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for inclusion - according to Des@@ cri@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ professional , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days has been applied , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically important . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose of dose with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients , however , was not devi@@ ating from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt @-@ lette with as@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at to take were the formulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg tablets were not examined in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the Dos@@ age studies in children however support the pharmac@@ o@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tables the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melting coated tablet with as@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at to take were the formulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical trials tests for the melting shop , revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritation during clinical use . &quot;
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in among children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to them , is identical to the ones in children who are normal . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients should not take with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ type absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
the overall prevalence of the side @-@ effects among children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in group as with the placebo group .
&quot; for to@@ dd@@ lers between 6 and 23 months , the most frequently encountered side effects caused by the more common than placebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at a mal@@ dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ spre@@ ader there were no side @-@ effects observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ tru@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see section 5.2 ) in children &apos;s and adul@@ thood .
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was found no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may vary depending on the duration of symptoms , also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall assessment of the questionnaire concerning the quality of life of the quality of life of Rhino and vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets can effectively be caused by seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed to the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov in the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu , caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
&quot; a flu @-@ pan@@ demic breaks out if a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the immune system contained in the vaccine contained parts of the flu @-@ virus as &quot; &quot; body foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system later is able to make contact with a flu @-@ virus this pedi@@ ms faster . &quot;
&quot; after that , the membrane ke@@ epers of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , that recognizes the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not made to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treating adults and children over four years that are caused by human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the purchased immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who may not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ is may be taken as a solution to inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked , which has previously tested the anti@@ viral medicines of the patient previously , and the likelihood is that the virus is addressed to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg is the recommended dose of A@@ generic to body weight .
atri@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; Aids does not cure AIDS , but may delay the damage of the immune system , and thus also the development of associated infections and illnesses . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without k@@ av@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously hadn &apos;t been treated with pro@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously taken prot@@ eas@@ on , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the change in virus last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients , which had previously been no pro@@ vision@@ aries , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ asis was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; for children , A@@ gener@@ is also reduced the viral load , but with children who used to be treated earlier with pro@@ eas@@ ants , were very few of the treatment mentioned . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which were formerly treated with pro@@ eas@@ ants , that increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the viral therapy just as effective as other protein ones : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other protein release , it came under A@@ generic together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued to continue their previous pro@@ eas@@ on : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash , rash and FA@@ E ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ generic must not be applied in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ il@@ avi@@ r or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; atri@@ ase may also not be applied in patients who are cur@@ ated cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are just as well as A@@ gener@@ asis and are utilized in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who use A@@ generic D@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( deri@@ ves of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that can be caused by adapting immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ generic medicines used to treat patients with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; atri@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fication Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefits of A@@ generic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously been no protein . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally allowed under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was given . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission of the Gla@@ xo Group Limited announces the approval for the transport of as@@ gener@@ als in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is available in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , protein @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of am@@ il@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ il@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral agent and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ is capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base can not be inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg am@@ per@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 . if A@@ generic capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ generative gases ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg am@@ x@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ vertical , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ generic in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to as@@ gen@@ ase capsules with adult patients with moderate liver dys@@ functions to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; atri@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have little therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements that contain cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) are allowed to be applied because of the risk reduced plasma @-@ concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy cannot lead to curing HIV infection and that they can also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for usual , A@@ generic capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and be treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy with an increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal effects .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; patients with existing reduced liver function , including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
simultaneous application of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ aca or other Glu@@ c@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that can be metabo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended it is that the possible benefits of a treatment ou@@ tw@@ ined the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Sup@@ pression of the renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; as the metabolism of the H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors and Sim@@ vast@@ atin vary strongly from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , there is no simultaneous administration of A@@ generic , with Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ su@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods of determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ is may be less effective due to reduced plasma bars ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ il@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive effects can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses can be administered from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxicity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ cem@@ ic content of the A@@ generic solution for inclusion , this formulation has contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
atri@@ ase should be reduced for duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ as are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including protein release , reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exception of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases resulting in their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gl@@ yp@@ a@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports have an increase of bleeding including spontaneous tor@@ r@@ ami@@ ans and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immun@@ o@@ defect , an inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can lead to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ isation , higher Body Mass Index ) , reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral plant therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with minor therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with minor therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with drugs whose active substances are predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the elevated plastic tables with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a general development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to equi@@ pping the lower plasma bar through a dosage increase of other protein recept@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant herb ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
when a patient is already cur@@ ated cur@@ rant is the am@@ per@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror and if possible to check the viral load and prevent the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required when Nel@@ n@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ il@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max at 30 % for C@@ max . if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ per@@ r have been applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded if Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ av@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; doses recommended for simultaneous administration of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a machine surveillance as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study conducted for use of A@@ gener@@ asis in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the phantas@@ tic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ asis will be at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) do not require a dosage adjustment . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z in combination with am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both Prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other protein release and existing limited data can be presum@@ ed that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um con@@ centric of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r could possibly lo@@ wers .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the dimin@@ ished or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic bars . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin related effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , will fall to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin was not carried out , however , the plastic bar of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ il@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma to 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 6@@ 9@@ x in comparison to the value which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ il@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines , which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ generic drugs . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with A@@ generic . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other protein release , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ generic drugs as it can come to reset disorder . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as an enzyme ty@@ po@@ duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ il@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas bars . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ rab@@ bits , like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fiel@@ d@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ pin , ni@@ ble pin , ni@@ ble pin , ni@@ ble pin , ni@@ ble pin , ni@@ ble pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased to 10 by amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r , which may possibly increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake of as@@ cul@@ ase can considerably increase its plas@@ mas concentrations in connection with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection @-@ side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ori@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to Pro@@ ban@@ den declined , whereas the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 up to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ asis with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these Glu@@ c@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of a treatment ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ ghs the risk of systemic gra@@ zing oi@@ des . ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ su@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the elev@@ ations of plastic bars are expected to be expected in con@@ current administration . &quot;
&quot; because plastic ar@@ rests of these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ per@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am may not be applied along with oral endo@@ genous mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while at the same application of ap@@ gener@@ asis with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are advisable . &quot;
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein types of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am can point out on a possible rise in the plas@@ ti@@ j@@ ol@@ am region around the 3@@ - to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one administered together with am@@ il@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses can be administered from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of low reliability of historical comparisons , currently no recommendation may be given as the am@@ x@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be fit , when Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in the current gift of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ales anti@@ co@@ ag@@ gra@@ cia along with A@@ generic , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ botanical effect ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ ts , therefore , are also recommended alternative methods of contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended when using A@@ gener@@ is ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug must be applied only after careful indul@@ gence of possible use for the mother as opposed to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ apping R@@ atten , amp@@ ou@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether amp@@ ou@@ avi@@ r is over@@ thrown by people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction Study on the ab@@ om@@ an@@ ed rats , which was administered by the natives in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation zone Am@@ ar@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight at night . &quot;
the further development of the offspring including pig@@ til@@ ity and reproduction was not affected by the administration of Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r to the m@@ am@@ mal .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ gener@@ asis has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment have been slightly to moderate , appeared early and rarely resulted in the treatment process . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clarified , whether they are related to the intake of A@@ generic drugs or another simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the atrocities . &quot;
&quot; most of the below side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which protein @-@ formerly patients received 1200 mg am@@ are twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were set up by the examination units as related to study media , and were listed in more than 1 % of patients as well as under the treatment exp@@ ired laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fa@@ wn sub @-@ fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ hia of breasts and thor@@ ax fatty fat . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ able non @-@ treated people , treated with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a medium length of 36 weeks , was only observed one case ( Sti@@ ckers ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; rash were usually easy to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ er@@ ous nature , with or without itch , and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without being interrupted by the treatment with am@@ per@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were especially reported in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral plant therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of an introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , a inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100@@ mg twice daily ) , were type and incidence of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and CP@@ K values that were obtained in patients who were treated with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often . &quot;
&quot; in case of exagger@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; fi@@ anc@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 protein and thus prevents the process of viral viral and g@@ ag pol@@ ymers , with the result of an education of non @-@ irrit@@ ations , not infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ av@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both at acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ ist cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % ty@@ pe@@ de concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm at chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in treating anti@@ retro@@ fits non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ var@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Knights inhibit@@ ors , inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; at the sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ fits non @-@ treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ burst avi@@ r with 100@@ mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , entered a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to week 48 , where 14 isol@@ ates could be examined . &quot;
&quot; a prototype analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure inside the 59 concluded , with Prot@@ eas@@ ers did not present to be treated patients , showed Res@@ istence patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ il@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients treated with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following Prot@@ eas@@ on mut@@ ations : &quot;
gen@@ otype analyses of gen@@ otype @-@ based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems can be applied to the assessment of the activity of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ il@@ avi@@ r / L / M / M / V / M / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 32@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 32@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( Res@@ istence ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns are subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems to analyse the results of pesti@@ cides . &quot;
on Phen@@ otyp@@ ical Res@@ ar @-@ based analyses Klin@@ gen@@ vali@@ ous Phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otype @-@ resistant data for assessment of the activity of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; firms which exp@@ elled diagnostic resili@@ ent tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otype cut off ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a human test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ ali@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated patterns creates a certain crus@@ hing resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , clo@@ ac@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ equ@@ avi@@ r , but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data to cross resistance resistance between the am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ anch@@ or@@ ads , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ fits non @-@ treated patients , with which a Fos@@ am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , intest@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ avi@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ avi@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( 4 of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( 4 of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ ck keeps its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insulation materials ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early departure of a temp@@ ting therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the subsequent treatment detrimental .
&quot; the test@@ ament of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ asis in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized study ( 600 mg twice daily ) along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) , with a PI , predominantly with lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a hundred thre@@ e@@ fold ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included into the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superiority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group with regard to the time @-@ ad@@ missible average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks fixed when a non @-@ lower wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led gases based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , from which 152 with PI were pre @-@ treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
it was given no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI @-@ treated patients had given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell size of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cally on these data should be considered during the treatment optimisation , in case of the treatment of PI @-@ treated children of the expected use of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; administration of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ ar@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of the res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of the blood circulation in the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma , using the amount of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ per@@ ation that represents the active share , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration remains consistent with un@@ ju@@ x@@ avi@@ r , the percentage percentage of free active ingredient in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State at Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs have to indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or provide inhibit@@ or or sub@@ strate from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ per@@ v@@ r @-@ exposure as in adults with a d@@ osing of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; bag@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ ma@@ id@@ n@@ able than from the capsules , hence , A@@ generic solution and atri@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of kidney disease is likely to be low in the elimination of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r plasma plasma plastic comparable to those who are at healthy pro@@ ban@@ den after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the canal hal@@ ogen@@ free on mice and rats stood at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omas for doses , which were 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ ber@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ ology of aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on people , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , there were little evidence of adopting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial re@@ fr@@ actions mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes test in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ il@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ s nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
these liver toxicity can be supervised and proven in the clinical routine by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; up to now , clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ cul@@ ase or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles which were treated aged 4 days from the age of 4 showed a high mortality .
&quot; in a systematic plastic museum , which lay significantly among ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure to therapeu@@ tical dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes include thy@@ self @-@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ day skel@@ etal changes , which point to a hesit@@ ant development . &quot;
&quot; 24 . if A@@ generic capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ generative gases ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg am@@ x@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ vertical , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with Lyme disease or lighter liver @-@ dys@@ functions , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods of determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation are available . &quot;
atri@@ ase should be set on duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ as are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a general development . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max at 30 % for C@@ max . if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during the combination of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ av@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; doses recommended for simultaneous administration of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a machine surveillance as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z in combination with am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both Prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , will come to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ rab@@ bits , like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fiel@@ d@@ pine , ni@@ v@@ pin , ni@@ ble pin , ni@@ ble pin , ni@@ ble pin , ni@@ ble pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ x@@ avi@@ r , which may possibly increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to Pro@@ ban@@ den declined , whereas the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 up to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the current gift of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ales anti@@ co@@ ag@@ gra@@ cia along with A@@ generic , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ botanical effect ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ m@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug must be applied only after careful indul@@ gence of possible use for the mother as opposed to possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction Study on the ab@@ om@@ an@@ ed rats , which was administered by the natives in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation zone Am@@ ar@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight at night . &quot;
the im@@ memorial of A@@ gener@@ asis has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of exagger@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ av@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both at acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ ist cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % ty@@ pe@@ de concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells , and is 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ ck keeps its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insulation materials ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment optimization should be considered during the treatment of @-@ treated children from the expected use of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ ling amp@@ ou@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage percentage of free active ingredient in dependency on Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs have to indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or provide inhibit@@ or or sub@@ strate from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of kidney disease is likely to be small in the elimination of Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the canal hal@@ ogen@@ free on mice and rats stood at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omes in doses , which were correspon@@ ded to the 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ ber@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ t@@ arian Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on people , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes test cases of human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ il@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ s nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles which were treated aged 4 days from the age of 4 showed a high mortality .
&quot; these results allow to conclude that in young the met@@ abol@@ ishing routes are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ pri@@ mat@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for taking one in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , protein @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for entry was neither covered with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % less than a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ is capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base can not be inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to inhal@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ ali@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg am@@ per@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage recommendations for the simultaneous application of A@@ generic solution to use and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ gl@@ avi@@ r is not required for am@@ per@@ ation , an application of A@@ generic solution to take in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ cem@@ ic content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a Com@@ peti@@ tive inhibit@@ ing of the met@@ abol@@ ization of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to curing HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ generative ase does not prevent risk 47 a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods of determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation are available . &quot;
atri@@ ase should be extended to duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cos@@ as are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports have an increase of bleeding including spontaneous tor@@ r@@ ami@@ ans and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ ar@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a general development . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max at 30 % for C@@ max . if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; simultaneous intake of as@@ cul@@ ase can considerably increase its plas@@ mas concentrations in connection with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection @-@ side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
on the basis of data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are expected to form Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .

&quot; the application forms and duration of treatment with al@@ dara depends on the treating disorder : • When driving in the genital area , Al@@ dara is weekly to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell cycles , it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the cycles of cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
the cream is wr@@ acking before bed@@ time th@@ lessly to the affected skin areas so they get enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with placebo ( the same cream ) compared to the active ingredient . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete absorption of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma treated in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and amoun@@ ted to placebo either daily or five times a week .
major indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete absorption of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara has also been tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • For the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , total waste rate was reduced from 66 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or itch ) .
&quot; clinical typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ eric , un@@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic not@@ at@@ ants ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immun@@ ologically adult , if the size or the number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy , and other topical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less appropriate . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to leave on the skin and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue as long until all visible f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or period of life or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the treatment described above should be weigh@@ ed when intense local inflammation could occur ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) or if in the treatment area an infection is observed .
&quot; if in follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the individual lesi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose has been dropped , the patient carried out the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is wi@@ ped into a thin layer and in the tigh@@ ten to cast with f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts infected skin @-@ area until the cream completely moved .
&quot; in these patients , there should be an assessment of the benefits associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their autoimmune dis@@ infection . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be an assessment of the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ@@ ig@@ h or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was conducted , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is were observed and a case with one for circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ d . &quot;
&quot; when an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of heavy local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 ) . in rare cases , heavy local skin irritation have also been observed and / or resulted in temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in passing urine that required a emergency ca@@ the@@ ter@@ ization and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; in connection with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ am immediately following an treatment with other cut@@ aneous funds for the treatment of extreme f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital and the period of time , there are no clinical experience before . &quot;
&quot; limited data refers to an increased rate of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ms in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has demonstrated a lower efficiency in this patient @-@ group with regard to the removal of the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the Bas@@ al@@ cellular car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is within 1 cm around the eye , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line has not been studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions takes place in general during the treatment or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is required due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be done by several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months of treatment available , other suitable therapies should consider other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with relap@@ sing and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not represent clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment consists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ pants on ey@@ eli@@ ds in the inside of the nose and ears or on the lips within the lips .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the data available via the ac@@ tin@@ onic ker@@ at@@ osis in the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this field of application , so it is not recommended that such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur often , but these reactions normally take in the course of the treatment of intensity or go back after the end of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin @-@ actions are big discomfort of the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 devices ( lesi@@ ons ) showed less total healing rates than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients , which receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryo or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after a mal@@ ignant use of quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um mirror ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most frequently shared and as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream into related side effects were local reactions at the place of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
among the most commonly reported and as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects are complaints at the application location with an incidence of 2@@ 8,@@ 1 % .
the treatment @-@ based clinical study of phase III reported by 185 to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III effects are presented below .
the most common ones as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection of side effect were in these studies a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; side effects , which were treated by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ eable clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; this according to the evaluating evaluation of the clinical signs reveals that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently came to local skin interactions including dr@@ y@@ them@@ ain ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Sec@@ tions ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ der ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review of the clinical signs , the clinical signs intended to show that it came into these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often to severe adult issues ( 13 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe inc@@ iner@@ ation and bon@@ ding ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for the examination of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was noted with an incidence of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidentally unique recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headaches , mysti@@ gies and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized according to oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increasing systemic concentrations of the alp@@ interference and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
in 3 authorisation relevant Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in regards to a complete hal@@ low of the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in a I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
&quot; at 60 % of all patients infected with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients , the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts complete ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo patients in the case ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete cooling could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 16@@ 1 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ recurring application per week over 6 weeks has been examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the tum@@ ors were hist@@ ological confirmed individual primary ultra @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of these data show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) , all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and stayed for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three @-@ three weekly application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ eable controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ onic , un@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic AK@@ - lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 big treatment are@@ as@@ than on the un@@ eas@@ iness scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observers studies show a recur@@ ren@@ ces of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment rooms .
&quot; the approved indications of external dis@@ likes , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ inten@@ tional Bas@@ al@@ cellular car@@ cin@@ oma do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara cream was examined in four random@@ ized , double @-@ controlled study of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses of doses ( 3@@ x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w ) .
a minimum system of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug con@@ centric concentrations in the Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amoun@@ ted to 0,@@ 1 , 0,@@ 2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml in the use in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 bags ) , and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated half @-@ value @-@ time of the half @-@ time period was around 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ h@@ hour period , after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged ret@@ ching of the drug through the skin . &quot;
data regarding the systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low to topical skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adult and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four months study of paint toxicity in the rat led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg to significantly reduced body weight and raised sp@@ leen weight ; one also four months long @-@ guided study on the der@@ mal application revealed in the mouse not similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity at mice at der@@ m@@ al administration at three days a week induc@@ es no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system absorption of the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ s is a risk to man due to the systemic exposure as very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice , which was treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger number to than in the control group with minor U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have considerably imp@@ aired or you will notice side effects which are not specified in this usage information , please inform your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; in the study mainly the safety of the drug was examined , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by being tested in terms of reducing the mi@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine was around 60 % , and half of the treated children referred to an normal large liver by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , rash , pain pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen consumption ( a measuring size of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may possibly react severely sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information every year , which may possibly be known , check and update this summary required . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will be patient to observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission told the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. has been approved for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms throughout the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human @-@ α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ Mamm@@ als ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ gh@@ ock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to the long @-@ term enzyme in patients with prot@@ ectable diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ots I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be if the patient carries this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h in single steps .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years of age has not been identified ; and for these patients there is no automation scheme recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined and for these patients cannot be recommended as a driving scheme .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients may develop in@@ fu@@ sion@@ ary reactions that are defined as any aspect @-@ effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be eng@@ ul@@ atively monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in the re @-@ operation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; because little experience lies ahead with regard to the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cautious due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ p@@ airing ) to minimize the potential occurrence @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ia / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at half of the in@@ fusion rate , in which reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred has been resum@@ ed .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ia / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate based on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me shouldn &apos;t be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists .
&quot; animal &apos;s experimental studies are not allowed to close direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which have been expon@@ entially about breast milk , is advised , is recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to satisfy . &quot;
&quot; side effects in clinical studies have been classified as in@@ fu@@ sion@@ ary reactions , which at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed . &quot;
&quot; unwanted pharmaceutical interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history occurred in addition to severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial wrinkles ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children of un@@ wished drug impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 @-@ study , with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with mainly severe reference form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of treatment with a service release , whereby it came to a serv@@ o release in the age of 5 ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no idea of radio@@ immun@@ o@@ itations ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say veri@@ fiable antibodies , including 3 patients where there has never been too serv@@ o version . &quot;
patients with lack of low anti@@ body rejuven@@ ine have shown a robust reduction in the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies a variable decrease of G@@ ag in Har@@ n was as@@ certain@@ ed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 @-@ study ) showed a margin@@ alized to minor defects and effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - Activity in vit@@ ro that didn &apos;t seem to interfere with the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted medication actions , even if the occurrence of unwanted drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies . &quot;
the justification for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of another accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzymes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ orous recept@@ ors . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eable controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the whole disease spectrum was recorded , the majority of patients were endemic to the Middle phen@@ otype and only a patient referred to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exposed volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute secret track in the 6 @-@ minute case test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label recording study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated with the placebo group an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the en@@ vi@@ ability which is represented in the table below .
an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks at the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as comes out of the following table . &quot;
the decrease in the expected percentage of the FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clinical and the absolute mon@@ ary capacity increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of the children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly reached before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the g@@ ag @-@ mirror was established in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant up to the degree of study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease of disease between patients , which summ@@ arized by the use of a combined effect , the clin@@ ically significant changes across the 6 @-@ minute guide , movement area of the shoulder blade ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a degradation in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; there has been a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study conducted in which the safety and the pharmaceutical production of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients , at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy lead form and 4 with the middle age form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a scale growth ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( s = 3 ) was determined by the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle age form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle age form presented only limited or even no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ cker schem@@ ata have been conducted on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the har@@ n , the liver , and the 6 @-@ minute guide test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the culmin@@ ation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have difficulties with weekly instructions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two runners is equi@@ vocal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if required , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ aci@@ dity , toxicity in fer@@ ment@@ arity , toxicity and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data do not recognize any particular danger to the human being . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who still have no chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) if the cancer is not removed alone ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ignant or metastatic &quot; &quot; non @-@ cell &quot; &quot; lung cancer , which is not sei@@ zing the epitheli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy reg@@ im@@ ents as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or with which particular other side effects occur , the treatment should be absorbed , or reduced the dose . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed conver@@ ts the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells to share . &quot;
conversion from P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells which results in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ignant P@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy against their condition . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived at an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in all@@ ots of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies , patients , in which cancer have not resor@@ ted to the epitheli@@ um cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival rates than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission of the El@@ i L@@ illy Neder@@ land B.@@ V. issued a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
any diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle must be re@@ vered with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % natural sodium inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ st@@ sis is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ise bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % natural sodium inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body area ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduction the frequency and severity of skin interactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses , and intake must be continued during the entire therapy duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also get an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third time hand@@ ing cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before each gift , a complete blood @-@ image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ mbo@@ genic umer@@ ation . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 times of the upper limit . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dosage adjustment will take place under Ber@@ gy@@ ms of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the predicted treatment cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the information in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Bu@@ C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ degree 3 ( except ne@@ ural ox@@ icity ) , the treatment must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be dis@@ continued when in patients following 2 dos@@ ages in@@ duction ( or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or so@@ - continue with the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies did not give any notice that in patients aged 65 years or over the age of 65 years there is an increased risk risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data about uncertainty and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min . no dosage adjustment needed for all patients recommended Dos@@ age customiz@@ ations .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restric@@ ting to the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - threshold and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ core of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver metastatic ( in the presence of liver metastatic breast cancer ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ wing market , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ genic figure has once again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately number , thro@@ mbo@@ genic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ atology toxicity , as seen in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hä@@ mat@@ ological and non @-@ th@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ ins such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was observed , if a pre @-@ treatment took place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore all patients need to be reli@@ ed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction and related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous ing@@ esting non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy ; on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which treatment with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is provided , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s must be avoided with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , prev@@ ent@@ ative hypertension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a dra@@ in@@ age of supplements can be weigh@@ ed in front of the ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including mut@@ yo@@ car@@ nal events , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of the frac@@ tories ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an irreversible skull - the reproductive capacity of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be pointed out , men should be pointed out before the treatment g@@ inn , advice on sperm production . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can lead non @-@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a dimin@@ ished ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ yl@@ lic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed reads ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data regarding the interaction potential as with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ycle bin , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat the patient ducks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ gra@@ cia .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ ites are expected to be heavy birth defects during an application in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely - demanding and careful indul@@ gence of usage for the mother and risk to the fet@@ us ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment begins to take advice on the blocking systems . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed reads to breast milk , and unwanted effects in inf@@ illing inf@@ ant may not be excluded . &quot;

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that exercises its effect by str@@ apping wi@@ ch@@ - @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several view@@ points , by blocking the Th@@ y@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ tum ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ ase ( D@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ at@@ dependent key enzymes of the de Nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis by Th@@ y@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des are . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study by AL@@ IM@@ TA plus Cis@@ pl@@ atin against Cis@@ pl@@ atin with mal@@ ignant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om showed that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and Cis@@ pl@@ atin patients received a clin@@ ically significant benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to such patients , which were only las@@ ered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population &apos;s population that received the test medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ignant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ ine @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms po@@ urs through an improvement of the lung parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and a ren@@ aming of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function in the course of the time in the controversy .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy followed patients ( blocking to Tre@@ at Pop@@ ulation n = 2@@ 83 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 2@@ 88 ) . &quot;

patients who use All@@ i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should consult with their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not reduce some fats in food , thereby causing a quarter of which with food @-@ led fats un@@ locks the intest@@ ine . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .

it must not be applied in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ replies ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood flow .
&quot; it may also not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver illness ) , and in pregnant or at nursing mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Limited to approve the authorisation of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
&quot; alli is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with an easily hypo@@ alkal@@ ine , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
alli must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 as not enough data is available for effectiveness and safety .
&quot; however , as Or@@ list@@ at is absorbed only minim@@ ally , and in patients with reduced liver and / or renal function , no adaptation of dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Un@@ term treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
&quot; the likelihood of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken along with a fat @-@ fat , or fat @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist consult because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels should ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist asking if the dosage must be adjusted to these medicines .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating events , in order to remedy the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study of interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma plastic .
&quot; when using War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ales anti@@ co@@ ag@@ gra@@ cia in combination with Or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values could be influenced ( internationally normal rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E , and K , as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the standard range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement to take up a mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure an adequate intake of vit@@ amine ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single @-@ mal@@ dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteer volunteers , which at the same time received Or@@ list@@ at , a slight decrease in the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; veterinary studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryo or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ases are prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were detected from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available is not identifiable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side @-@ effects that have been found after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were volunte@@ ered by a population of a certain amount . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli gains in terms of possible or actual injury @-@ intestinal side effects can lead .
&quot; individual doses of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ luggage of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight individuals , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of the market attacks , either side effects or similar effects are reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on man and animal , from a quick rep@@ lica of systematic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ ven@@ ous properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the ma@@ gen and the upper small intest@@ ine by the co@@ ro@@ ente bond to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ lic and pan@@ theon li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies have been extracted , taken three mg of Or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ id trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ alkal@@ ine , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in the body weight opposite the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course process ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight loss was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output worth 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; with the wa@@ ist size the average change -@@ 4,5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output worth 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabolic Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , for therapeu@@ tical dos@@ ages may not be metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;

alli is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 years with an Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) from 28 or above . there should be applied in combination with a fat and cal@@ orie reduced nutrition .
the BM@@ I helps you determine if you are a normal weight in relation to your body size or overweight .
&quot; even though these diseases are not likely that you feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for check@@ up . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight , which you take during a diet , you can lose using alli an additional kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or chem@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not a prescription drug . &quot;

please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on to treat cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia . • A@@ ve@@ osis for the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take alli and if you take medicines to hypertension , since you may need medicines to be adapted to high cholesterol levels because possibly the dosage must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; as you can set your cal@@ ori@@ fic@@ es and fat tail limits , you can find out more helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you have a meal or contains no fat , do not take a capsule . alli can only act if food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in connection with a meal , which contains too much fat , risk the nourished effects ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to the new eating habits , you already start before the first capsule with a cal@@ orie and fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; dietary di@@ aries are effective , since you can track any time you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your diet habits . &quot;
&quot; to achieve your goal weight safely , you should set two daily objectives in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Do you treat yourself fatty acids in order to reduce the likelihood of mal@@ nourished effects ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
&quot; remember to ask your doctor in advance , if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • St@@ ay you during the intake and even after ending the intake of alli physically active . &quot;
&quot; • alli may not be taken for longer than 6 months . • If you are able to determine a reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of application of alli , please ask your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under circumstances , you need to finish the intake of alli . • At a successful weight loss it is not about to switch to diet only at short notice and then return to old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule after . • If more than an hour since the last meal has passed , do not take a capsule . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects hang together with the effectiveness of the capsules , and thus creating that the fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects tend to occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment , since you might not have reduced the fat content in the diet to this time . &quot;
&quot; with the following principles you can learn to minimize the nutritional side effects : • Beg@@ inside you already some days , or better one week before the initial intake of capsules with a fet@@ al diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite dish and about the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you can exceed your li@@ mp@@ ing limit . • Don &apos;t share your recommended fat quantity on the daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat range or a well @-@ known re@@ ti@@ ch@@ ism , as you may occur in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying models occur , learn to control this with time through adaptation of their diet . &quot;
&quot; • medicines for children to store un@@ accessible . • You are not allowed to apply more to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the exp@@ ir@@ ation date . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with sili@@ cone gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;

obesity has an impact on your health and raises the risk to the emergence of various fatal diseases such as : • hypertension • Diabetes • coron@@ ary cancers • oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk for these disorders .
&quot; a lasting weight loss , for instance by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent severe disorders and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed permanently healthy . &quot;
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ le which you can also find as a indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake gives an how many calories you should take maximum per day .
&quot; note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum of fat , which you should take with every meal . &quot;
&quot; what amount for you is suitable , check the below described below , which is the number of calories which is suitable for you . • At the bottom of the capsule the capsule is critical . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat , as previously , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to the recommended gre@@ ase supply , you can maximize the weight reduction and simultaneously dimin@@ ish the likelihood of mal@@ nourished effects . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 These reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to shed weight approximately 0.5 kg per week , without losing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; low physical activity &quot; means that you work on daily 150 k@@ cal , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; for permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to these also . • T@@ ry is a nutritional book with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the intake of alli . &quot;
&quot; the alli program for the support of weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you to feed and fet@@ ters and give guidelines , be physically active . &quot;
&quot; in combination with one on your type trun@@ ks program to support weight loss , you can help you develop healthier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ate , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended that there is not enough information to the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient is the bond of chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemotherapy reg@@ im@@ ents were obtained , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the powerful trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , showed 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , showed 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours of chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 15@@ 3 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission issued by the company Helsinki of Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a licence for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : towards the prevention of acute symptoms and vom@@ iting at strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting which is induc@@ ed by a severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding one prior to chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron can prolong the dick@@ head , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable when using Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval extended or which tend to be prolonged . &quot;
&quot; besides related to other chemotherapy agents , Alo@@ xi should be used neither to treat nausea and vom@@ iting nor for treating nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies im@@ planted Pal@@ on@@ osis , not inhibit@@ ors of the five analysed chemotherapy agents ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ ak , Cy@@ clo@@ ak@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant phar@@ yn@@ cr@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ or Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ el@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one , chlor@@ ine , tr@@ ox@@ etine , tr@@ ox@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron . &quot;
&quot; experience to use Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in human pregn@@ ancies are not suggest@@ ing , therefore Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to watch effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least possibly stood with Alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the destination ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of unwanted events , like in the other do@@ ings groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given every day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blin@@ d@@ study were received a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ate and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ osis , which were given up to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which was given 1 intraven@@ ous . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; after the clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the ion@@ als and re@@ pol@@ arization participating in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization of the ion@@ als and extend the duration of the promotion potential . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of the study conducted at 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was to assess the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ V in sol@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial elimination of the plasma concentrations in the body with an average period of time , about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration period ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in patients and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , that was measured at 11 high @-@ car@@ cin@@ om@@ inations between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ cular simul@@ ations it appears that once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which a intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher ; however , the C@@ max was higher after a 0.1 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and some more 50 % are converted into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recipes . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for Met@@ abol@@ ization , have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 were involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous micro @-@ injection , the overall body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ osis is increased , however , a reduction in the dose is however not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered sufficiently above the maximum humane therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre@@ clinical trials took note that Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron can only block in very high concentrations of ion@@ als that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and can extend the promotion potential for action .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron ( each dose said about 30 times of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) who were given daily over two years resulted in a increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , pancre@@ as , ad@@ renal cord ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses of doses and since Alo@@ xi is destined for a unique application , the relevance of these results will be very low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for transpor@@ ting the Commission must inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport of the drug in the context of this decision .

June 2006 the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which condem@@ ning the approval for the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C to the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is an biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same pharmac@@ eu@@ ably effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Re@@ ference Manual &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue has damages , moreover , the values of the liver enzymes are Alan@@ in- Amin@@ o s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which allows them to form the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that occupy the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , effect , safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared to the effectiveness of the Re@@ ference Manual by means of 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment sessions as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment was referred to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed in detail that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and market . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , applied to the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ing the disease in more patients than with the reference manual , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test has been introduced in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cruci@@ fied skin infection ) and small in@@ infected in@@ toxic@@ ations ( cr@@ acking or ker@@ f@@ aded ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used to treat infections that have been veri@@ fiable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant pile @-@ resistant for@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , patients may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not on treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was disp@@ at@@ ched after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of the 71 patients below placebo .
&quot; in the treatment of infected bon@@ net , Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ ave and about 90 % of the patients in both groups spoke to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( whi@@ tish sharp@@ ness in the body tissue ) or of infections which were demonstr@@ ably or presumably by MR@@ SA was not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation in the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ ghs the following superficial skin @-@ infections in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin @-@ infections over the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , de@@ infected small in@@ toxic@@ ations , de@@ preci@@ ation or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a licence for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients , in which two or three days do not show any improvement , should be investigated once more and an alternative therapy will be considered ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the event of raising or severe local irritation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment will be interrupted , the sal@@ ine carefully rep@@ airing and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection began . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies on secondary wounds was the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ yl @-@ resistant pile @-@ resistant for@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs .
the impact of simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans to topical skin or infected superficial wounds is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After the current gift of 2 @-@ 3 every day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on a me@@ ager skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systematic exposure to topical application in patients may not be held liable if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin applied in a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction according to oral in@@ ges@@ tion and are inadequate regarding a statement on the birth and the Federal tale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy when a topical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and that the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine is the gift of a systemic antibiotics .
&quot; when deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / termin@@ ated or termin@@ ated with Al@@ tar@@ go continues , the benefits of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy is for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies to 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , most of the reported cases of irritation during the appointment , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ al@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ al@@ anus ) . &quot;
the functioning mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial prot@@ ein@@ ic synthesis by interaction in a specific ties of the 50@@ s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differ from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the ties of the bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 are involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ centre .
&quot; by binding on this bin@@ ders inhibit@@ ing P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially block P @-@ bin@@ ders and prevent the normal education of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be aimed at the basis of the local prevalence of the resistance for the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some information forms , should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to methane . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; • Res@@ p@@ ation In a study with healthy adult , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin all@@ ine was brought on a daily basis under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) that received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ographic treatment of secondary wounds , individual plas@@ m@@ ations were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients prior to medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion of 1 % sal@@ ine on 200 c@@ m2 is reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human@@ ic liver micro@@ som@@ ing was primarily performed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under the lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies for oral toxicity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid lesi@@ ons . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the permit for transpor@@ ting needs to make sure that a pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system , such as in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is presented ( Version 6.2 ) exists and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product market is applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval for the transport network is committed to carrying out more detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance activities , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as any additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline Risk Management Systems for Medi@@ c@@ inal products for the human use , the updated R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; if you want to stop irritation or other signs and symptoms , then you should end the use of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , creams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the area that will be treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expressly ordered from your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , on the mouth or on the lips , in the nose , or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ be made of closures on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years which are not yet im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one out of two doses of existing vaccines , whereby protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the imm@@ uni@@ zation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the existing vacc@@ inations can be brought to an end from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or -@@ B vaccine may be given . &quot;
vaccines have an effect in bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; how it can rep@@ el against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system re@@ jects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as that since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and who since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix &apos;s adults and Twin@@ rix children can be administered into one of three doses of existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults are identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the percentage of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six month @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient at a se@@ ater and at a 12 @-@ month distance between injections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appetite deficiency , pain on the inj@@ ector , redness , mat@@ uring , and aff@@ lu@@ ci@@ bility . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic to the active ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) to the active ingredients of the active ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission issued the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als S.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix throughout the whole world .
&quot; the default route for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ Un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered for the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her chim@@ ney is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines or with a combined vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A vaccine ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size order as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ oval vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o @-@ competent persons , which are addressed to a hepatitis C vaccine , a refres@@ her chim@@ ney as protection , as they are also protected with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies as possibly by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injections , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combined vaccine , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; at hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ se@@ patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , under circumstances , no @-@ sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body is achieved , so that in these cases the Gift of other vaccines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration might lead to an optimum imp@@ fer@@ ment , these injections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with Th@@ ro@@ logical cy@@ top@@ ic@@ ie or blood @-@ curing distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ compar@@ atively sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it may occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix had administered in the second life of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular poli@@ tic@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us sup@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficiently ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immun@@ os@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers , it must be assumed that there is no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study which was conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former thi@@ ckets and preserv@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
clinical studies have been administered by 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations in the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness based on a calculation base per vacc@@ inated dose Ambi@@ rix but not on a basis basis per person .
pain has been observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the commission observed , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the pro@@ ban@@ den after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccine @-@ cycle reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den to get Ambi@@ rix had given rise above pain , over 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the pros which have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the incidence of mat@@ ures was compared pro @-@ tape ( i.e. across the whole vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix received , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the pros that received the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ation@@ . ) &quot;
the frequency of imp@@ aired pains and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to that which was observed after the administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of local actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was formed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , at the 6@@ - to 11@@ am @-@ olds , however , according to vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , however , was a common occurrence of pain ( at the inj@@ ector ) per dose , not per pro@@ ad@@ mill . &quot;
&quot; the share of vaccines , which reported via heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activ@@ ated hepatitis B , and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis B , was statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies that were carried out at vacc@@ inations between 1 and 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study , which was carried out at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ation@@ ary with three doses . &quot;
&quot; at the 2@@ 89 persons whose immun@@ o@@ genesis ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose material , significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ o@@ e@@ wers who were obtained in a clinical comparative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , a month after ending the full vaccine ( i.e. 7 month 7 ) , are listed in the table below . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
&quot; for individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be proven above at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix at the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccination scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ o@@ reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which after vaccination of 3 cans with a combined vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a tin volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be compared to the vaccination scheme by anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
&quot; when the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the refres@@ her of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Poli@@ tic@@ ular , and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us clo@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as well as for earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ code to investigate possible external particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all the vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be completely protected from infection with hepatitis or hepatitis B virus , although the complete vaccine is completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both ino@@ cul@@ osis Ambi@@ rix is already infected with hepatitis or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those after a hepatitis or hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed . &quot;
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express through it@@ ching skin attacks , respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have had an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B at your child . • If you have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually planned administration of the second vaccination dosage ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective component ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination dosage of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine right before ending the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from individuals who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , suffering from the skin and not into the muscle . if you are weak@@ ened / your child on account of a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s body defense , or if you / your child undergo a tick @-@ modi@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of those individuals on vaccination may not be adequate so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccine is .
&quot; 21 sa@@ ws your doctor if you take a further medicine for your child ( including those that you can get without prescription ) , or if you have administered without prescription ( antibodies ) or if you have given up / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / or this in the near future is planned . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficiently . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ ence is not administered or breastfeeding women but it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of data that have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the inspection , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits risk for Ambi@@ rix stays positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was limited only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used with patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete en@@ gen@@ ess effect , or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy ( brain injury as a result of high mon@@ am@@ mon@@ ary concentrations ) in the pre @-@ history . &quot;

&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ ies could not be compared with a different treatment or with placebo ( a false medicine , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ y can also lead to loss of loss , an abnormal aci@@ dity level in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash , rash , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary fec@@ ycle to high am@@ moni@@ tions are effective .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps has been approved in &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval there is only limited information about this medicine . &quot;
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ deficiency has already manifested itself in the newborn baby ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ term form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , who is manifested according to the first life @-@ month ) , there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low the tablets or for patients with si@@ ck@@ iness is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose will be customized , taking into account the protein intake and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer at an early mani@@ ac deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ kable , is the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with an arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency do not have to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with lo@@ ins distur@@ ban@@ ces , as a risk for the emergence of the ho@@ opo@@ hag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a exists when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , or severe kidney failure , and with sodium and oil @-@ related clinical states only with caution . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is carried out over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of the neur@@ onal proliferation and become a crus@@ hed loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a hesit@@ ated mat@@ uring of cer@@ ebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and hence a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is retired on men in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients came at least an unwanted event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events , it did not come up with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; the most likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old anom@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ too , he@@ ap@@ ocal@@ yp@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred at a 5 @-@ month old baby @-@ child with a lon@@ ged single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed at a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose of ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection resulting from acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary fec@@ ycle can be accepted that for each gram bi@@ ases sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the early @-@ mani@@ ac form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alogue within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen fuel , sodium and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first lifetime ) diagnosed in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rates were 100 % , but even with these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ yl deficiency ) , who were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ yl but@@ yl and a prot@@ ection@@ able diet , amoun@@ ting to 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ den@@ sely in liver and kidney measurement with glut@@ amine , using phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine were formed after the gift of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ aking healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after just as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses taken up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral lon@@ d@@ osis of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plas@@ mas concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ureth@@ ane disorders or hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin@@ ia , according to various doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; with three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is retired within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the conve@@ ying product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans , rats no cl@@ ot@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children , which can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with si@@ eves ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a no@@ stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer at an early mani@@ ac deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ kable , is the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ feder@@ ate were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; the most likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old anom@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ too , he@@ ap@@ ocal@@ yp@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary fec@@ ycle , it can be assumed that for each gram sodium sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen . &quot;
already existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after an oral lon@@ d@@ osis of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can keep the ready product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this action the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot reti@@ re according to the consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if conducted at you laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not a prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine could move into the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headaches , flavors , indul@@ gence , indul@@ gence of o@@ bedience , dis@@ oriented problems and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms with yourself , you can immediately contact your doctor or using your medical hospital in order to start the appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed to equal se@@ d@@ osis oral or over a stomach fat ( hose , which passes through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose son@@ ic ( hose that is guided through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • take out of the container a wi@@ ped ru@@ spo@@ on of gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge , for example a mes@@ ser@@ tion over the upper edge of the Mess@@ l@@ öff@@ ler to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The recommended number of measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium . ( an anom@@ al measuring value at electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose will be administered , and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in all@@ u@@ ine or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood flow ) with conventional combination treatment ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during PCI the patient has often been a St@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood flow like Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients , subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all the indicators was as effective as lifting , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than ha@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other bu@@ d@@ dine or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied in patients who had recently had a blood , as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or cardiovascular infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Medical Diagnos@@ tic ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a more acceptable substitute for s@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 the European Commission issued by The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a licence for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ lever inf@@ ancy ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in an emergency deal or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous stu@@ ff@@ ing of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation on 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after PCI can be added to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg can be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended Dos@@ age of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous met@@ u@@ g of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a corresponding intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.1 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re @-@ constitu@@ ted and dil@@ uted medicine should carefully be mixed in the use of the application and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will quickly be given intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion@@ d@@ osis is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.2 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT was re @-@ insp@@ ected 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney injury , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which resulted in the approval , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ age customiz@@ able at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see under Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous form of non @-@ fac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours following ending the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of molecular hegemon@@ y .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against mil@@ u@@ dine • Active blood cells or increased blood pressure due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ al epitheli@@ um and / or irreversible sc@@ aff@@ i@@ tis . • heavy kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding - especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most bleeding may occur to arter@@ ial points can be found in patients who occur to a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) while the treatment basically occur anywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R group ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value of hi@@ ring the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din once again reached the level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the functioning mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thy@@ ro@@ tic or thro@@ mb@@ osis , etc ) , it can be assumed that these drugs raise the risk of blood . &quot;
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ logical aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters in any case regularly control .
&quot; the veterinary investigations are inadequate regarding the effects on pregnancy , the embryo or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questionable hegemon@@ et@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group , as well as in the group @-@ treated similar comparisons , women and patients over 65 years of age have come more frequently to unwanted events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
heavy bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI standards for heavy blood vessels like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in the groups with lifting plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ printing plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy blood was defined as one of the following events : in@@ hibition , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ o@@ cular or surgical intervention required , ha@@ em@@ ulate the hem@@ mo@@ bell mirror of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with famous blood flow , re@@ operation based on a blood supply , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; more , less often observing blood loc@@ alis@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of point , g@@ astro@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ logy , ear , nose and neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients who subjected itself to a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in the groups treated with he@@ aters , it was often more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than with male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significantly less often than in the comparison group below lifting and GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive application in practice and are arranged according to system classes in table 6 . &quot;
in the case of an over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately breaking away and the patient eng@@ ul@@ ating with a view to the signs of bleeding .
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific thread inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the anim@@ on@@ en@@ bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine lies in the liquid phase or in Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on the one hand spl@@ its the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ pro@@ 4 , thus creating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine in re@@ generated . &quot;
&quot; in addition , by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , with Ser@@ um of patients , in which it was induc@@ ed in the past to the induc@@ ed Th@@ ro@@ logical Th@@ ro@@ logical Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , does not indu@@ ce any thro@@ mbo@@ genic Ag@@ greg@@ ational action . &quot;
&quot; in healthy pro@@ ban@@ den and in patients bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine shows a dos@@ is@@ - and con@@ centric anti@@ co@@ ag@@ onal effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was conducted in the patient , an additional bolt should be increased from 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine and the in@@ fusion should be increased for the duration of the operation on 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was given a frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever inf@@ ancy ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either before the start of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk factors , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread even@@ ly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased car@@ et@@ inal biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of patients undergo within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that need a treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with a insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot produce enough insulin in the blood scheme ( su@@ gars ) in the blood or may not process insulin effectively .
insulin gene is vast@@ ly different from human consumption and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of time than a short @-@ effective human life .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a slow insulin treatment in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; for type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin can not be effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes has been a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be applied in patients who are perhaps hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ ins or one of the other constitu@@ ents , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
doses from Ap@@ id@@ ra must possibly be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission of San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH shared approval for the transport of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the thi@@ ghs or of the delta to use or sub@@ cut@@ aneous due to continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal seal . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , the insulin demand can be down in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of strength , the brand ( standard writer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can undergo a change in insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or demo@@ lition of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gl@@ yp@@ a@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic ket@@ ac@@ acia outlet ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin is required under strict medical supervision , and may require a change of dosage . &quot;
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the substance profile of the insulin used and can therefore change after switching of treatment .
&quot; increase the substances which can increase the bleeding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in , mono@@ chro@@ y@@ ll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , S@@ ali@@ cy@@ late and sul@@ fon@@ ar@@ amid . &quot;
&quot; additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ ies such as bet@@ ab@@ ass , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ id@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine may be the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ regulation la@@ undering or absent . &quot;
&quot; veterinary studies for the reproduction of animal diseases showed no differences between in@@ su@@ ction ling@@ erie and human consumption , regarding pregnancy , the embryo or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin is over@@ cast into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical trials known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organs , and sorted according to decreasing the frequency of their occurrence ( very frequently : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( incidence on the basis of the availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold @-@ quiet , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , uncommon ar@@ tery or weakness , confusion , concentrations , excessive Hun@@ - ger , changes of vision , headaches , nausea and heart knock . &quot;
Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy Wir@@ d failed to change the inj@@ ecting location within the inj@@ ecting area can occur in the result of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy in the inj@@ ecting location .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic with consci@@ ous@@ y can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections of glu@@ el@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by one physician or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the pri@@ mor@@ dial thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by stimulating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub @-@ cut@@ ans Ga@@ ther@@ be of insulin &apos;s impact occurs faster and the length of time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - insulin gene insulin gene manipul@@ ating effects , and 0,@@ 3 E / kg ( 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in glucose effect , just as human@@ eness . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ um has a twice as rapid impact such as normal Human@@ itarian and achieves the complete glucose effect about 2 hours earlier than human .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that for an application of insulin delivery in 2 minutes before meal an comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control can be reached as with human normal , 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; was weigh@@ ed in 2 minutes before meal , was reached a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ger control than with human normal size , which was given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is reached for insulin delivery in 15 minutes after the meal , becomes a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like in human normal size , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ o@@ ves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the onset of meal compared to human normal , 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) was given before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after meal ) after the start of the meal compared to human standard , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
