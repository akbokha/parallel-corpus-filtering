<seg id="6">Bilify is used for the treatment of severe to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injecting solution is applied to a quick control of increased anxiety or behavioral disturbances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting cup of patients which are being used with tablets difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="11">Arizprazole probably affects especially as a "partial Agonist" for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means Arizprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da dopamine and 5-hydroxytryphiamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripibozole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and will prevent their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases, compared to a period of two hours with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with semi-operating dol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilized to 160 patients where the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of bilify injecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that tied to germinted unrest with which by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>

<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injecting solution showed patients who received Abilify doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms associated with symptoms than the patients received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder, asbilify reduced more effective than placebo in four of the five short-time studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">Bilify consumes up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapional disturbances (sleepiness), vomiting (beats), symptom and exhaustion, restlessness (swelling), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Medical Diagnostic (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to serious manic episodes in patients who had overwhelmous episodes and in which the manic episodes had to outweigh the treatment with Aripizole in comparison to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"moreover, the committee joined the outcome that the benefits of injecting problems in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>

<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient-group, a lower initiation dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>

<seg id="35">The occurrence of addictive behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased risk risk associated with Aripizole in comparison to other anti-psychotic cancer.</seg>

<seg id="53">"if you consider the common use of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should prevail over the patient's potential risks."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protein peers, are likely to have similar effects and that is why similar dosages should be made."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that need a treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or administered as a continuous infusion with a insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot produce enough insulin in the blood scheme (sugars) in the blood or may not process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin gene is vastly different from human consumption and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of time than a short-effective human life.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a slow insulin treatment in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"for type-2 diabetes, in which the body of insulin can not be effectively processed, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of the substance glycosyllified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type-1 diabetes has been a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>

<seg id="2974">"Apidra must not be applied in patients who are perhaps hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin lulins or one of the other constituents, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses from Apidra must possibly be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission of Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH shared approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as subcutaneous injections either in the area of the abdomen, the thighs or of the delta to use or subcutaneous due to continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal seal."</seg>
