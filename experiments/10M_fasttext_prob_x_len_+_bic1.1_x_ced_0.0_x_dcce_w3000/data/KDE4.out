&quot; the module website can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; option under ex@@ tras website , select the output and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is displayed at the site of the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very rudi@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , translations of the translations make no important decisions dependent , without checking the translation before . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert a set @-@ up texts directly . &quot;
&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ sign@@ ors ; despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the use of &amp; contem@@ pl@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual , &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Add @-@ ons .... open the map material , and select the required modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a partial list of default modules from the package ; add @-@ ons . please note that some more modules are on your system , in case you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; counter ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the cras@@ hing module , click in the &amp; counter ; at ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module Noti@@ filter ( also called Ord@@ ner@@ filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; contex@@ tu@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M elements in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : document@@ item , all other knot@@ s are sub @-@ elements of this root range . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbolic and text views , so that you can view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in depic@@ ting the folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is displayed by a rec@@ tan@@ gle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size needs to possess that the sum of sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries it is specified . thus , the size of a folder can be easily detected if it can be seen far below into the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; -@@ commands you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ dial @-@ display a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . it is easier to simplify navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colour and labelling . &quot;
&quot; the colour of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which is switched from color mode , can be either depth for the easy recognition of the mer@@ cen@@ ary sti@@ ff or the illustration of another file , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the different features of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether the space is displayed at all or whether the surface of sub@@ ordinate rec@@ tan@@ gle may be used ( where hence the surface of restrictions on the sign of the pedal ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of cap@@ tion in the rec@@ tan@@ gle in the rec@@ tan@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; setting algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be adher@@ ed to the rule that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ dial in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rec@@ tan@@ gle square is square . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries is left , the implementation is left to it . here , it is necessary for the sign@@ alling and avoiding space losses by frame always advantageous to the square that are as square . the best methods of this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal required area for an entry over the menu item in view . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ ordinate entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under special image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call the picture gallery , a dialogue opens with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
&quot; the option of the page allows you to adjust to the title of the picture gallery page , in a text field . &quot;
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a turn@@ key to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the cross@@ wise fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , you indicate whether the fil@@ en@@ ames be displayed among the thumb@@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
display the image size of the image if the file size is shown below the thumb@@ pictures in the gallery .
&quot; with the cross @-@ box image size , you indicate whether the size of the pictures is displayed under the thumb@@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery will be stored and what sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in file selection store in HTML file , you specify where the HTML page is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the inter@@ sect box sub@@ folder , you can adjust with a sli@@ der or a rotating field , up to which level the sub@@ folder should be included . &quot;
&quot; with the original papers , you can copy , whether the original pictures are to be copied into the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the commentary file , you can use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the cross@@ wise shade @-@ depth , you can specify a different colour @-@ colour for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings provide easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; con@@ sign@@ ors ;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings can be found in the &amp; counter ; menu under ex@@ tras HTML @-@ settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

one of the most beautiful things to publish ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; publication ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all the graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to supplement &amp; writing ; by writing a small module to complement one function , when changes in &amp; writing came ; even perform . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change the full@@ screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; drag and disc@@ ard images works everywhere : you can disc@@ ard an image in a different part of the tree , over the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only constra@@ int is that an image is not incorporated into keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a data selection allows you to extract the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame is displayed only when this ind the symbol@@ ism is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the settings settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your phot@@ al@@ bes . all photos submitted by &amp; publication are stored in a single night@@ club , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date when the album was created first , and the date can be changed in the album properties tab . &quot;
&quot; in case you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Rem@@ ix images . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select album imports . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse to the target album and drop it . in this then , the menu you will have to move or copy the image through moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to include information about this collection . to click on the album properties , you must right click on the album and edit the album menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Kolle@@ ctions : are one method to select your albums so you can choose under a common name , using the collection from the tool@@ bar , or if you want to add new collections after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : it is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums and sort by date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , new@@ ester : these put the date on the one &apos;s oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came to an album in &amp; writing , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; selected . this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative , and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a night@@ fall box . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be wasted .
&quot; and writing , the entry of keywords for individual photos in the area of My key@@ word list left in the main window . album Collec@@ tions have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this watch with the two lou@@ pe drops in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you must wait to wait while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided when you use in the menu ex@@ tras all thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the preview display . what information this is , you can publish about settings ; modify here the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails your li@@ king . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails disp@@ ose of things , the cl@@ ones . if you let the mouse show a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all of a photo . the scre@@ enshot shown above in the section introduction to the main window displays such assistance window . &quot;
photos are all what it came to &amp; publish ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as they fit . you can preview all the features that connect with &amp; writing ; you can choose between the viewing menu of the thumb@@ nails or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the viewing of images , a seal or editing of the pictures . &quot;
you can view the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or select the menu menu of the picture with the right mouse button and Edit ... select a guide how you can edit your photos . with picture editing you can view your photos and change them .

&quot; you should note that after processing through other image processing programs it may come to problems with the met@@ adata page . some programs do not store this data with off , when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ E and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc. . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came ; poses two options for rotation . the easiest is to select the right mouse button on the preview , and select the figure . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . remember that you keep enlargement ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; writing , it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; f@@ 8 picture Dele@@ te or Ent@@ f If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by taking Shift . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sl@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organizes your photos by the data . &amp; publish ; used either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; selecting a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture gallery . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the fil@@ en@@ tion , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with key@@ word provides a flexible and powerful possibility to organize and cat@@ alo@@ ise your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this key@@ word or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here , you can arrange your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also cl@@ ap parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling record , so you can find the keywords which you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and access key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . besides , the tags are imported to the loss of the database re @-@ imported , as soon as I got ; the pictures are noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new head@@ words by clicking on the right mouse button , either click &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or to an existing key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing word , this key@@ word is this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word on the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . just the keywords will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard it . then , a menu that gives you the possibility to reloc@@ ate . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time . &quot;
&quot; you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button , and edit the key@@ word button . you can change the name of the keywords and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; mine sampling . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu as Album Settings . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to get out ; s functionality with key@@ word to deal with key@@ word , you must first select your photos with key@@ word : once you have chosen the photos that you can click on the key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling record . alternatively , you can right click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown once you choose one of the keywords , for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this will appear under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word in which you can right click the menu menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu , the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent h@@ isto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shifted over this h@@ isto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rec@@ tan@@ gle of the drop @-@ frame . this will display all related pictures in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can input a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , file stamp , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; liner er search box is a small lamp that will find green if the search results occurs . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all the images are shown again . if the search has nothing , then the lamp is red . &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ bar . if you open it a simple search box such as the above described above has been shown . you can search this search here but as live search that has been saved as a search criterion . after you have been saved a filter on the list .

&quot; another mode is better suited to send quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields on the left . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions are also working directly from the table as e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
&quot; all images from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails , for example . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end of each range you find a built @-@ in foam function , which you recognize along the crossed paths . in order to pi@@ v@@ ise the visible area of the picture , you need to click this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode Pre@@ view the same will then show both pictures in the same image range . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as well as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse scroll to enter the image and out into zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode Pre@@ viewing .
&quot; what is a digital mapping management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory cap@@ tures any part of the process that has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos saves , sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , you will find , protect and use photos again . we look at the downloading , to remove , remove , evaluate , archive , em@@ bos@@ sing , archive , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital mapping administration takes an indication , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , secur@@ ti@@ zed , transformed , pre @-@ assembled and exports content to a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata is provided according to your definition of data providing information about or provide documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1,000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find out more than 1000 photos on your machine . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you are sure not to store quick retri@@ eves and a secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you need something inside your system is to build information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be stored on your computer , or click on a network drive &amp; etc ; note that you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you have sufficient photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg . 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; will then export a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work processes , constant access of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % of work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for these contents . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata option store in the settings page of Met@@ adata . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently choose the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what to change ? to give them a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now select every photo examples , let@@ tering and a review . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you often mean by other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed pictures from a different source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ tization came ; automatically paste the tree to the right place . the sor@@ ting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling out a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are tr@@ acked by &amp; digi@@ tization . while the sub @-@ trees are tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is re@@ printed , since every block of met@@ adata is made in truth out of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are attributes of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to alleg@@ ations or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most anyone who just want to see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in getting your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from a distance not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos is probably more important than the picture yourself to create an interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength to act solely with a lab@@ eling for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; writing , you can store any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE can even export it to your wishes into the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web content system . &quot;
remember the days before GPS ? when you had to find into another city without any navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good because with images the train of spatial presentation is now already using light speed .
&quot; the possibilities that ge@@ olo@@ c@@ alization exploit are already un@@ coun@@ table and can be export in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can reproduce their journeys via pictures with geographical references . this then also displays the photos at reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove constraints on the distribution and modification of copies . the same liberties are also valid in all the changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of &amp; publish ; as information should be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for actors and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization is used , then it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support comm@@ as sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on as separ@@ ators . &quot;
title ( syn@@ onym for publisher ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working copy of the photographer . examples of this can be like a photographer &apos;s photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . as this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must be also filled out . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the use field to identify who works the photo . if the photographer does for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , the group / agency will offer the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this cannot provide protection against misuse . anyone who has no more than basic knowledge in working with computer , can delete or change the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important to it . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique each image . &amp; digi@@ tization came ; will be made available in the near future , such a module for st@@ acking processing . &quot;
&quot; topics : plate errors , breakdown , black@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or fire . these types of losses are the same that can also happen in traditional paper pictures or Neg@@ ative . in this section it is about problems with the so called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest datas@@ he@@ els in the world , has some interesting statistics which has the reasons for a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem in CDs / DVDs are to be treated cautious and you can no longer stay than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe this lies in your area play@@ room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you store good dis@@ ks and good recording equipment and they are not much more reliable than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it is about choosing the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are highly suscep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you just have been written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and control . despite this massive protection they need through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged dis@@ ks , hard drives , flash drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the pro@@ mat@@ ing war against the HD DVD . a dual Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and therefore almost 6@@ ms the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray Disk .
&quot; slowly burn out the data with a good recording unit on high quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . likewise , you need to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then on a clean , dark dry and specially protected area . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
&quot; disco@@ s retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guarantee com@@ prise a new disk , but not the data . Google places a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ mis@@ study &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the Temper@@ art@@ ur@@ ian range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ aments , SM@@ ART can not notice this error . some of SM@@ ART cookie will terminate the immediate im@@ pending error . these are especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and Publisher . the expected life @-@ time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the full loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric version before you have secured the files , but these losses usually allow themselves to restore no major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not make much effort , this is different from devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your machine these anom@@ alies blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware connection , destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
most widespread protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that covers a part of the energy balance and the rest is grounded . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . remember that not every plug @-@ in also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be sure he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against ligh@@ tening and thus protect the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should be sure to also use all the periph@@ er@@ als that are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide super@@ voltage protective e , which also includes a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cables of the cable and television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have an Not@@ ebook , you will need a portable voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed especially for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations into the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection against over@@ laps , these devices can automatically update cordless energy when a black@@ out occurs . this gives you the ability to save your data and run the system again . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns you the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and and compare its security in electricity problems with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is used . to conclude , you should always remember all the cable before you go to holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , you are at home very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional variant will not be available to you in case of Flickr dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be first checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission error messages are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a shared memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission defects . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs put at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
&quot; the worst thing is that you have occurred to you when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ detected until you have no protection to your computer . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection inside your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that inside your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transfer loss , as they produce interference in the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that are able to handle records of low level and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a compliant license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for Linux and Linux . please read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ l file system . this is still in the alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . at not@@ ebooks the proportion of theft is already 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer sighted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , It@@ Fs , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dened file systems . please find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the trial process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the major causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that the technology further develops , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are not far away from this limit . &quot;
today cameras are moving towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or major formats .
&quot; thus , a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro . therefore , make no one else responsible for data loss . therefore , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything about the re@@ installing of your operating system , the exchange of boards or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation un@@ lucky : fire , water , electricity , children and theft . they usually affect a whole room or house . &quot;
&quot; hence , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ tex means always a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above all is a common reason for a loss of data despite backup the panic . if you have a backup we have not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential : backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : to the full backup and the final differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . this ensures its original status at any time that such backup was made . this backup comes with an expiry system next to the exception that is only deduc@@ tible and not continuously updated .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transm@@ issions r@@ sync just the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come to secure a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least a month and a snapshot of each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC Information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ modelling of images and met@@ adata , copying systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... &quot;
&quot; with this valuable images to survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you truly are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to look at all that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by means of the explanations in this document . use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is an expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s go out that you have planning the scal@@ ability with plans and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift the one to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t attach it . &quot;
&quot; / Dollar ; DD if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software more that can read it then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
gi@@ f is a proprietary , patented format slowly disappears from the market . therefore you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard developed by the G@@ IF . it can be los@@ sy , supported X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit and full transparency . P@@ NG can be needed as many administrative information but not as many as TI@@ FF and have a slow comm@@ uter . this format we want to be saved to save your pictures . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of free comp@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digital negative file format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ screen format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was now developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata . a handful of camera drives DN@@ G now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology , which is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata ; file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; a lot of photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits , however , when the met@@ adata appears separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI occupational groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections , and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera edit are , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your blank archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fin@@ ite processing you can use external programs . when you return the pictures again , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were under the circumstances of the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited paintings for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to Web@@ galleries , use in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; publication . in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description , as you can have photos that you already have on your hard disk , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your database database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; publish ; connect them to the machine , turn off the camera on the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this tries to connect with your camera . some cameras don &apos;t appear to appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for file order are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page files and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that are internally stored on the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras , not all information available . &quot;
&quot; the Met@@ adata tab shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; writing ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos to your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from All . this loads all photos of their camera in a single album in &amp; writing ; . when downloading the pictures will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures can be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you selected the photos , use the button to download and then download extracts . the button exp@@ elled until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported this , an option will download new download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; writing ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in advance window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All download or download selected , a dialogue with which you can choose the target album , in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is sorted according to normal folders . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; publish ; invites the pictures from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by clicking the button deleted . if you just want to delete them , then you have to select this first and delete them deleted . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . therefore , the photos are completely deleted . you should carefully check whether the photos are completely deleted from the camera . if you want to cancel it from the camera , as this is significantly faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this can be used to double fil@@ en@@ ames , in case you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for dat@@ ing@@ based sub @-@ based sub @-@ sections . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos on the record are stored . the first two relate the data to the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
&quot; if you want another data format than the standard format , for example in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % S . apply the option date &amp; time . for further modifications , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or in large letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; publication ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used if you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; publication ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording , to perform an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the page side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic spin is switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , lets &amp; publish ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic spin , use the button Exp@@ anded and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is made information about the date when the photo was made available , I can write &amp; publish ; this information is based on the image data . not all cameras are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can re@@ read what information you may have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; publication ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the button button @-@ based sub@@ commands at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is download button . select then upload files . the file you can choose from , which you can select the files which should be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the selection is done , asking &amp; publish ; you , where the images are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and push OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your machine . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that is specified in long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude , which can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphic an area through automatic recording of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graphic . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can click with a click a browser which indicates the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; publication ; users want to locate the location of the photo , it &apos;s good to get the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card reference . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic attri@@ bution ( manual ) and finally about the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . however , there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as card module or through transfer of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

downloading the GPS data from a device can be done using g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic attri@@ bution .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tu@@ dinal or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters aff@@ led coordinates , which are created e.g. by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which will show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; I came to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . change . to access these settings , you have to change in the Settings menu . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
action can be displayed on an embedded preview or editing image . you put the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ o- and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected by downloading from the camera interface . even at a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for fibre : this field should contain the professional use of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations like An@@ nam@@ ter photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description about the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to indicate the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this image is available for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press ; if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should provide the image here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thereby the met@@ adata is constantly being included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; writing ; this met@@ adata also contains other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; imported without lost .
&quot; image texts as an embedded label ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can also add to your photos , including pictures embedded in pictures . therefore , your alleg@@ ations may also be read by other images . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information , which appear if the mouse cursor in the main window rests over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; and # 160 ; digi@@ tization came ; supports a number of different educational formats and some video formats . to specify , which file types &amp; messages came ; display , you can add the exten@@ sible files of this list and remove . any file in a publication ; Alb@@ um@@ ber that has no one of these extensions , ignored by &amp; writing ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; default settings can be reset again , by pressing the button Update to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lighthouse and checking came ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , you only have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the image . these colours are specified here . in the picture editing you can integrate this vision mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and off .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ subscri@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ aire than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the near@@ er explanation . &quot;
&quot; by setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG requires a los@@ sy @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can put this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ress you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate images for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is los@@ sy .
&quot; with the adjustment of loss JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can be los@@ sy . even if you have a los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was still in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; publication , the image processing was only a picture @-@ view for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard embr@@ aces is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixel of the C@@ CD sensor can react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light . this option features a minimal loss of detail . this option draws the image a bit soft , eliminated the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD standard method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used immediately by the camera . otherwise , when set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard is it a solid color balance , which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps get more details in the sh@@ re@@ es . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the Spitz@@ l@@ ter , so that parts of your pictures are burned out , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera to consider the more advanced white . finally , you can try to re@@ construct the setting in different horses . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ es . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as quick as satur@@ ation as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the lack of green and red shares from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course , this is a question of how much color or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ aire value according to your li@@ king . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard one . however , this can also later be done in the pictures options . this can keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should approach conservative . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to convert an entire image from the particle data sensor , which have many cameras and is known as a Matrix color sensor . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; writing came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it was made possible . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ b . it produces color@@ fully in the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting when you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color gra@@ ft of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction because during the raw design . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and provides instructions on how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information such as the color information from a far@@ my@@ ard in the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior Ques@@ tions if an image is opened in image editing / colour management module with raw files .
&quot; colour profile @-@ folder Set@@ ting you here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization came ; examine this folder then during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can change when opening the blank file later .
the shade view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the entire screen .
&quot; input profiles should be applied to the camera character and model that you fit . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color header or gam@@ ation error . currently , correct d@@ cra@@ w Gamma not for conver@@ sions have to perform at 16 bit depth . this means you have to perform the color scheme . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image has been given by a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could you correct manually rather than rely on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is rather obvious that colour profile is planned for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profiles leaves the style for the purpose : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutrality , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image faces and image processing ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then loaded down by &amp; digi@@ tization . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the list . &quot;
&quot; commands for tasks performed by modules , can set in the menu under settings short command . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the upper re@@ gler j@@ us@@ ts the time between the image cards , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other cross@@ roads apply the met@@ adata and that are displayed at the lower end of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there exists a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , you are here serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active , if you specify a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera body . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; letters ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , put it in display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; writing came ; the camera automatically recognizes , if not , you can set cam@@ am@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for moving from &gt; images in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can adjust the inter@@ ferences of &amp; writing ; while del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections of delete a photo and del@@ eting one album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side bar can tac@@ itly framed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; applied , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also get the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in starting to cap@@ tives , this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ process of &amp; writing ; &quot;
&quot; the hi@@ ring subsi@@ dy to new photos forces &amp; digi@@ tization came ; the base sub@@ folders after new or deleted albums / photos are found ; if something out of the base folder was deleted , asking &amp; digi@@ tization ; see if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; writing ; to adjust the main window to your li@@ king . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs were defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for this tutorial , you will find further information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correction and improvement . the image editing may be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or through the context menu of the preview display / Edit menu . &quot;
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them stand as modules in &amp; writing ; therefore under certain circumstances you will be part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the picture editing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , order factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top of the top , and among them the tool@@ bar to the fast access to the most frequently used functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing changes your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saving or button storing from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you should be able to make a copy of your image , before you change it . this can save you with a file saving . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu File Re@@ produce or button the button Select image processing in tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last time . &quot;
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or re@@ done . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting trac@@ e@@ ability or restored by selecting mach@@ ining from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make yourself the short@@ cut short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for res@@ posi@@ tional and c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; for a moment longer , you get a text menu . if you choose one of the menu entries , all actions are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image highly , picture down or the entries in the menu file , you will ask if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel , or the symbols in the tool@@ bar , or the entries in the pane menu . &quot;
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view , where you can use the Es@@ cape key . normally , you can view this within the creation dialog of &amp; publication . you can view this from the publication ; main window . view the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print in the menu image and get the standard &amp; col@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . you only have to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ters printer . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the publication list ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available without the navig@@ ational file , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked : &quot;
&quot; multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear , or disappear again in the edge . &quot;
&quot; in this review , you can input or insert signs with unlimited size . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted . the cap@@ tions are used in the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 signs . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 signs and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC model field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented , you can use either the button or just change the next image , the sign@@ posts will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the application button , there is one button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also select the met@@ adata page when you choose a met@@ adata setting , always written into the pictures . &quot;
the Assessment section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search and Sor@@ ti@@ ations . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . the review from the side@@ bar is always used to rate multiple images at the same time . select this and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keywords show a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords , and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; publication ; -@@ Session addressed . &quot;
the keywords will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the key@@ word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you entered different keywords , these are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding cross@@ roads in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main window and select a key@@ word in the keywords , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to have a sample with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word report . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - dates , and view@@ points . if additionally one or more keywords will display from the right side . all keywords are displayed . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keywords already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . as a result , a dialogue you ask whether you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window the pictures on a calendar day . the sampling filter is reduced by No keywords , what the quantity has been reduced to three pictures . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word was drawn from the right @-@ right @-@ tree to choose from and down there . dialogue will be asked if this key@@ word is supposed to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place in each start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and discover that there should be one or be , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , keywords , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set a wide search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the cross@@ ink at the end of the rule and then to use the button group . the options then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly on &amp; writing ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colours that have actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow you can achieve that the colors will print on your monitor of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish in the web from your digital dark chamber .
&quot; if the subject comes to colour administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to express for the results he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information about color management . in addition , you will find links with deep information to make your own informed choices so you obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your work@@ work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the S@@ R@@ GB @-@ bro@@ w . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image spending is by e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
&quot; so if the R@@ GB works so well and that life for everybody is so easy , why should one use another Far@@ bro@@ w and therefore have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of S@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the R@@ GB Far@@ bro@@ m , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color rooms so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to escal@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ bro@@ m ?
&quot; yes ! if you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ bro@@ m or not , you need to escal@@ ate your monitor since s@@ R@@ GB works that your ; on@@ itor is based on s@@ R@@ GB . if you are working as a bro@@ w of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to use either your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , a fitting monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve an image in most cases . use it , before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , extrac@@ ting , automation and contrast from the menu Kor@@ anic Autom@@ atic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which is best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method will scale the leu@@ ka@@ emia values over the whole image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without its color shades . this function often is a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ ts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of the intention is the same number of pixel . sometimes the same very good results in improving the contra@@ sting of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracle in one image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic lev@@ elling : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue canal . it identifies the dark and light border over@@ tones and j@@ us@@ ites the red , green and blue channels on the complete H@@ isto@@ gram area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new up@@ setting of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ comparison of &amp; digi@@ tization came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
&quot; the whit@@ eboard is somewhat limited as over a far@@ ble with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to perform far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you use the whit@@ eboard in the pipe mode , which results in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a whi@@ ch@@ equ@@ ino@@ x of copyrighted by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym is protected . you start it via the menu entry colors white @-@ like the image editing .
&quot; the showcase can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original picture and the preview of the target picture . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ eness , then it is enough to click the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos comes with a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ escent of Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; to the right top is a h@@ isto@@ gram shown that dynam@@ ically changed , as soon as you have a parameter change . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful because you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , sati@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadows adju@@ sting you can improve the shadow details of your photos or also download . &quot;
&quot; aver@@ aging the above controls , you should use the color @-@ temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . push this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the whit@@ eboard . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator is increased the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. they will display the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and charging exactly this . every setting of the whit@@ eboard which you have set , you can save it into a text file and re@@ charge later . &quot;
&quot; the button @-@ settings returns all the filter values again to its default values , and the associated with neutral whit@@ eboard . note that also neutral settings may be changed as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust here the codes per color channel of the mach@@ ined picture . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the far @-@ spread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this code also requires more disk space , computing time and stands on@@ ly@@ as for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw pictures . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the help of color , you can draw the chapter color administration . &quot;
another important tool is available in the menu under colour sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to store several color channels at the same time and allow you to always use your settings . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correc@@ ting problems is the tool for the gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; writing came ; tool Far@@ be@@ ers provides you four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a bone filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of the chemical processing was solar isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er called , an effect was created when one completed a partly developed printing of a short flash , and after that the development of the picture completed . the result was a part negative of the picture . this tool allows you to fin@@ ite this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally generated a negative image that is not generated in phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edit the ( 2 ) . the intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation by making it a stronger contradiction , which makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it easy , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on daylight @-@ optimized colour movie made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color , but also some photographers , especially those who are barely landscapes . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repeat the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . at large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras have frequently asked problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon for you to change the color contra@@ sting and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can try to experiment with the different color aspect of your photos in the menu under colors . all of your alignment can be displayed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce a good choice to increase satur@@ ation instead of raising them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm changes with oo@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ ch@@ ure / contrast / Gamma is the tool key tool to improve exposure . even if dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you need for the application of application only the area of sli@@ der . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ sity values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , the active channel , or the selected area . under the graph@@ ene , three sli@@ ders are thrown into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the controller and look at it , as the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right side the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically , updated by the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the h@@ isto@@ gram is shown with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera . in pictures the large areas of constant color will include linear h@@ isto@@ gram of a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark notes , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for middle tones , frequently gam@@ e.@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three shades of colours can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically convert the inputs of the shadows , middle and light sounds automatically . in addition , there is one button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
exit status : the exit status permit the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the exit status as well as in the inputs . for example , the compression of the exp@@ ires can be used as background while being able to see something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this kno@@ b , the values are automatically set depending upon the intensity of the image . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons the values shown in the file system can be saved and re @-@ loaded later . in addition the Gimp levels format is used .
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the inputs are automatically re@@ funded for all shadows , funds and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the h@@ isto@@ gram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ escent channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adju@@ sting of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the exit status are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original is displayed as well as the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel which is changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols can switch between a linear and an log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . for pictures with large areas of constant color , linear mode is generated a wide beams . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue . &quot;
&quot; for example , move a short panel to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds with darker pron@@ o@@ ids will be corresponding to the corresponding image pixel . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is us@@ hed according to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ charged . the file format is the Gimp Cur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ ting buttons , create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and Sunday . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to put the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ escent curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kanal . shadow and Sundays is applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the original ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the publication ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the pictures . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
with the channel box you can choose the color for the h@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first note how you can correct the channels by pointing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target picture features a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the h@@ isto@@ gram to show you the corresponding colour value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are on the right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to activate these channels . if you activate the appropriate color component , the channel bl@@ ender then DAS tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portrait . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a paint leads to a visible ru@@ gated board , which does not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion process in which you reduce the colo@@ uring . &quot;
storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any Mix@@ er setting can then save you for later and then load it . used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue canal is re@@ vo@@ wed . the option L@@ umin@@ ancy is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step as color pictures can be simply converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ tape profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford P@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
Grün@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all scene images and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .
&quot; orange painting : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange pe@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so much like the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange painting . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic academic effects and can simul@@ ate the moon waves to day time . so much like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yel@@ lowing : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lin@@ ator filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ ep@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium sounds while it adds a bit of cold in the fri@@ gate . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ scho@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ ep@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; writing ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like a oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait on a wall . the menu application image application the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the image .
a paper text @-@ show is applied on the photo shown below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; writing ; tool frame may add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photos is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ak eye . under picture frame the module can also be started in the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you make the desired portrait type for your image . in detail the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ tr@@ ine ren@@ ders it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting of the ideal is for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with pattern . &quot;
width : returns width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is 1 % to 50 % limited .
&quot; the frames decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially when you have used the tool after side ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text into an image to any page . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from the color body and the character set with its properties as you need . they will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &apos; OK &apos; . after the picture once saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; writing ; tool Sch@@ abl@@ one can apply a sten@@ cil over a picture .
the menu picture template using image processing can be used to set sten@@ cils over a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , if you want to add your Sch@@ abl@@ one of the file size . if you want to add your Sch@@ abl@@ one of the file size , please send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; publication ; mailing list entries came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ ian folder with the button button folder in dialog . select the folder in which you copied the Sch@@ ab@@ ov@@ at@@ rots . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the sten@@ cils has been set , a building view that reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ ner . the selection of a folder updated the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this kno@@ b shows the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; : this kno@@ b res@@ ized the below image . it is set around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you have to switch the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move the image below to shift the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be adjusted in size .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came , represents three different tools for switching . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for switching . it is very fast and easy , but creates especially in dark areas , bas@@ ins images . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ est mask works at the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it &apos;s not a bit of bit psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been removed from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the result of the dig@@ itali@@ zation process color combined with only minimal sub @-@ differences . this in turn leads to a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are usually printed as normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; with JP@@ EG images , a camera has often been used in internal control . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners can use a po@@ orer filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you get the control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can obtain useful results by looking for a photo with the sharp@@ ness pull @-@ out pull . this allows you to enter the menu item in the menu .
&quot; you should however deal with caution , as the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but ampli@@ fying the noise . in general , the usable technique for sharp@@ ens an image is re@@ focus . below re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for switching . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : an image is too cris@@ p . the solution to paint a bit soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to paint a bit soft , using the menu item on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
&quot; the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red , a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here . &quot;
the original image and the preview help the image to edit . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values frequently produce good results and should be tried at first . an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , smokers and the impression of atrocities in the proximity of sharp edges are generated . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a can@@ te are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ ans . they should therefore raise images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image added to the original one . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference of the difference . by this way , a minimum difference can be defined for a channel of filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones of sharp@@ ens are exemp@@ t and therefore beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp image , which was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a value = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; writing came ; tool re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyrighted deto@@ x filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool tries to convert an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which there is a better approach than just trying the picture to shar@@ pen . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . they can easily reach better results as a bl@@ ur mask . you can start it from the menu , focusing on colors re@@ focus in the image editing . &quot;
&quot; in practice the circular F@@ altung is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the source pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse F@@ altung is in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular loops : this is the radius of circular f@@ ission . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the standard value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is bl@@ ur@@ red but then should be focused on hal@@ ogen .
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; win ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filters : an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . if the noise is too low , the image quality is very bad . a viable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to add the image even further . &quot;
&quot; delic@@ acy &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equally null , you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matri@@ mon@@ y size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ ac@@ at@@ rix . an increase in matri@@ mon@@ ial size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular loops or the palate . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded later .
&quot; try all the cuts , color and Inten@@ sive fac@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleas@@ ent arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you are reading images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg . as JP@@ EG , you should use the module to apply the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ cot produces better results than def@@ ec@@ lec@@ tions . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than be@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , a bl@@ ur@@ red mask must always create arti@@ facts . even among optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practical , the F@@ IR filter filter is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture must be corrected . this picture has been made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods of schedul@@ ing in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator smooth@@ ed the sharp@@ ness of the area that was bl@@ acked out bl@@ acked to generate a more natural p@@ one .
&quot; the color tin@@ ts enables a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark , you can set it here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the most widely used tool to remove un@@ desired te@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm has been developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different preferences as start @-@ points to simplify the restoration . all available settings are listed below :
if you want to edit the filter settings with a j@@ us@@ y you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
&quot; deta@@ il@@ ance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value leads to a uneven smooth@@ ed over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be subject to details so that no one should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated properly . please note that the deta@@ il@@ ance always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the direction of detail . &quot;
&quot; direction @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value un@@ ra@@ ging in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film bas@@ kets or C@@ CD Rau@@ e will produce a high value wav@@ e@@ similar patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts will best be removed near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all else@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value suit@@ ably to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves larger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns to how often the algorithm is going through . usually it is enough for 1 or 2 .
&quot; boun@@ cing s@@ nu@@ da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , it should also be small , so make sure that small angles should generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step @-@ wide &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step @-@ wide in pixel . you should put the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only minor . he doubles however the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as and charging exactly this . any setting of picture errors correct can be saved into a text file and re @-@ loaded later .
&quot; image errors fix is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load can move . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button below . &quot;
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with little arti@@ facts . the module is made in a photo that is being done in Guatemala City with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . as you see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact taken during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; writing came ; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce sc@@ ru@@ ps . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool presents selected image filters available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens , remove . it can also be used to remove sensors from camera or fashion ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensory cameras of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the scre@@ enshot shown above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high level of ISO sensitivity , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain at default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for filter . large values increase the time the filter is required per pixel and can cut the image below the radius and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : insp@@ ected the pixel size . this value sets the pixels to look forward to det@@ ecting light changes . if it is lifted up , you may change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer be obtained and rob@@ bery or lubric@@ ate occurs . &quot;
edges : controlled the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency answer . if it is too strong can not appear all the ru@@ pe@@ ar off or smokers can occur . put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a watch@@ ful noise or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ escent tubes of the picture . we recommend to change color or light density to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controlling the colour intolerance of the picture . we recommend to change color or light density to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which typically have been more poll@@ uted to increase . however , he also lubric@@ ates the shadow . &quot;
absorption : controlling the adju@@ sting of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ p@@ adding . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is lifted up the edges can occur . if he is on his minimum , smoking and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can appear at the edges . he can remove smokers and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save under and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for smoking reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with default settings .
&quot; sometimes an image is too cr@@ acking for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to draw a soft sign with the menu item . the showcase on the right side of the dialogue indicates the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the publication came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease phot@@ ar@@ te@@ fac@@ te .
&quot; this filter to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted te@@ facts from your pictures . it is very good adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s ru@@ ff@@ les , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sive ar@@ te@@ fac@@ tual and local bugs that occur in digital , original or subsequently ti@@ ly digi@@ ti@@ zed images . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the picture con@@ tours and thereby gets the content as it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the text structure is performed with a different tool , the error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ c , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts . this setting should correct these issues . &quot;
the buttons save as and charging exactly this . every setting of photo restoration may be saved into a text file saved later and re @-@ loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load can move . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film bas@@ kets on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo that has been used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that have been caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lights and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; publication ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed to remove . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ se . &quot;
light , dead or hot pixel are especially high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression about a built @-@ in repression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; lumin@@ ous method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file to the wizard with the button image . the tool will see automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to discover the dark picture directly after you to discover new names or bright pixel through C@@ CD defects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected picture . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . remember that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and again loads this automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result within the image . the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are established in all areas of sight .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixels . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it will be an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixel in the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ ous method . all the pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color photograph taken from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the publication ; Vig@@ net correction is a tool in order to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; objective objective , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the whole sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; however , he also has disadvantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter which it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . vast@@ ly light should use , even with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise discomfort caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the big exposure of today &apos;s filter and the color and gra@@ dations of digital cameras and movie scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ valence error . the tool is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three re@@ gl@@ ans you can control the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ ze filter and with three further exposure to the target picture .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which an optical filter with a blood level of 2 , ent@@ win@@ .@@ generate the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ ing correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re @-@ edit the exposure of the target picture with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values as you need to increase the settings only . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more refinement of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; publication ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the designation in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a leu@@ ka@@ emia and contra@@ sting also has been carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; publication ; Lin@@ sen@@ dist@@ ort is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des treated the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or consistent form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar broad@@ casting effect , but fla@@ wed in the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposite to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two can combine any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion , virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second Gra@@ des . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of pad @-@ shaped distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ des . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &quot; &quot; corners parameter &quot; &quot; has the opposite sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value will scale scale the image size and thus results in the correction first Gra@@ des through . negative values enlarge while positive the picture is smaller .
brigh@@ ten : this value j@@ us@@ ts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
the ton@@ s. or pad @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all @-@ cutting or size changes . best to cut this correction as any of the first one . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and then create a ton@@ ical correction .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool displays a vertical and a horizontal guide . move it into an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ator / pad with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a pad , the resulting image will have black corners . you can trans@@ duce them with the cutting edge tool in the menu trans@@ duc@@ ing out of the image processing or over the zoom re@@ gler of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most images the ton@@ ical correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as shots from the front , frame and painting it is the perspective to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating an infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is achiev@@ able under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) s@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitive range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters to adjust the gran@@ ule and film hyper@@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ul@@ ts texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO rec@@ ator changes the quantity of the film bas@@ kets and the dominance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter channels used to reproduce by infrared film , especially the Grün@@ kanal makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs since the color formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared camera applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ re@@ es .
&quot; the &amp; publication ; filter footage is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce footage at your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers large silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the phot@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mono@@ chro@@ med photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to the control of the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the standard is even though higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more Kör@@ ner , you can use the filter more times . &quot;
this is an example of the film production effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; publication ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of a oil painting . it uses the copyrighted material algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; publication ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper chosen the brush @-@ size between one and five . thicker brushes are suitable for large pictures . smooth brushes controls the smooth@@ ed or , from the other side , the arti@@ sti@@ ousness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the original one is marked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and j@@ t@@ te 17 .
&quot; the &amp; publication ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coher@@ ence . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful when you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ hed the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the carbon filter , the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further enhanced by adapting the intention . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; writing came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stu@@ ffed in wax . it used a protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; writing came ; filter grav@@ ur is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and look it , as if it is considered by glass blocks . &quot;
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using in@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ als lines that go from one center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels to the center . this simul@@ ates the discomfort of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
soft fol@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright sounds . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ok : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ fe : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ red them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation anytime with the button .
the regul@@ ators are a nice little tool to make regul@@ ates on your image . this gives you natural your pictures a good look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
&quot; dro@@ plet size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . as the width size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of drops in the image . &quot;
&quot; you can start with the &amp; publication ; image processing can hold an area free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that shall be free to choose . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of rain drops . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in transform@@ ers or transform@@ ers in the menu . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to reduce is simple . the big question is , how can you infl@@ atable a picture and sw@@ aying the details ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information once again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change is used a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ atable . &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ bles was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to say the tool you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; when this adjustment is activated , when the entry into the new size is the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves larger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons Save as and charging will be used exactly . each installation for photo can be saved as a text file saved later and re @-@ loaded later .
&quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example of photo infl@@ atable , by adding a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard increase . &quot;
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently managed operation , but also a commonly underestimated tool to create an image . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull off the rec@@ tan@@ gle , create . you will then see this rec@@ tan@@ gle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting edge . a new rec@@ tan@@ gle can be generated by clicking it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ cutting button , use the button button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save Target As in the menu file to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the thumb@@ nails , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool of aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format it is always assigned to the greater value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using cen@@ tim@@ etres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; bottom in dialog you can set up with the max . ratio button to cut down to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ ally or Ver@@ tik@@ al ) . when you use the cutting tools , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data will reflect the original image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the set @-@ up provide help to help you put your images better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of similarity . like the third @-@ party rule , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tan@@ gle into similar harmon@@ ic triangles with the di@@ ag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the golden center is a division dedicated to different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us sea or the bl@@ ouses of a sun flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have already used the ancient Egyptians and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the Golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 . a composition that is followed as visually harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put an image below . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos closer . compared to third @-@ party gel the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ et@@ ric visual flow .
&quot; another rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also golden rec@@ tan@@ gles ; it should be used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without putting the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden triangles also lead themselves from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . its verti@@ ces are the middle @-@ points of the pages of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not a equ@@ ilater@@ al triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to place these lines can have been published a static object . &quot;
if you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symm@@ etry . try your image to place one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic parts .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera fli@@ pped exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things turns around a corner . you can fix this with the &amp; writing ; image processing and tool free rotation . select to trans@@ former free rotation and j@@ us@@ tate to the finish angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the module free rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the two lines . after you have to fix it through an important point of the picture . now you have the angle described as in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot an image , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to trans@@ duce the function transformation from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function machine automation . select one of the following options :
&quot; the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing glaz@@ ed the picture a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ tin@@ tiv@@ ic transformations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which can help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , into pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , into pixel . &quot;
angle left on top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area .
angle to the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area .
angle on the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right hand corner of the transforming area .
&quot; after the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a bit lubric@@ ated . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you adap@@ ts the perspective , you get unbe@@ able tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to ber@@ some this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image editing . &quot;
&quot; the tool system is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal pattern , for example , the image will be distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle will be transformed into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module about transformation . &quot;
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nails .
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse into an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool@@ ing tool to convert your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image will be a bit bl@@ ur@@ ped . for a single pattern , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sets of dou@@ bling twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and hence should you avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear , the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image editing . &quot;
&quot; writing ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are related to your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of imaging formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all the available file formats on this site . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF . &quot;
&quot; it came out ; only displays files in formats to know . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file exp@@ ires ; modify this list of file exp@@ and@@ ments . in the configuration configuration you can find more information . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras will even allow you to select a user @-@ user format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
imaging compression is the use of data @-@ press lines to digital pictures . this helps redund@@ ant information to save the image data on a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other outcomes as JP@@ EG at the same compression deposit . the 200@@ 0s version may also be los@@ s@@ able when this is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous , and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the Roh@@ tic @-@ verter of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the configuration , you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
digi@@ tization came ; supports the pipe @-@ pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; writing ; all cameras can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats sent by &amp; digi@@ tization ;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . however , this is no film processing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; publish ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback movies to start playing the program . &quot;

&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four adju@@ sting with the module white . &quot;
many tools you need to use the photo processing products are included in &amp; writing ; your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as bul@@ b , soft characters , noise pollution , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the preview area . these modes include :
ver@@ tically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area &apos;s right of the selected division .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected division .
ver@@ tically split . the left area shows the original and the right for comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons to show you to indicate over@@ - and under@@ exposed . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and disc@@ ard on the part of the picture by which you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialogue is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ ts from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when it is available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ ature program . you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to draw a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses the your pictures Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ os@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used for editing of color pal@@ ettes , and for the selection and naming of colors . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ allets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can either apply to the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog box , you can select from a list of the installed pal@@ ettes or browse the files to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by che@@ wed in the area next to a colour .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor down . afterwards , move the mouse with pressing lin@@ ker button . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted off the color plate at the cursor . the color is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected by default . this mode can set you adjust by selecting the an@@ alogue to write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with actions copying , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ os@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a poin@@ ter sign , if another color is followed . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; col@@ os@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&quot; &amp; D viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing from &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ ite ; programs are free layout programs . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ ite ; included , are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; T@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for watching &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; box ; software in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; contem@@ pl@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph@@ ene newly re@@ counts and in &amp; graphic viewer ; represent )
menu to open the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; col@@ graph@@ ite ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
&quot; load large graphs ( currently , there are problems from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knot@@ s ) &quot;
further required Software : &amp; D @-@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . needs to be used in detail :
&quot; the main window shows the opened graphs showing each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; col@@ graph@@ ite ; without an argument , the main window will open only the icon file and open the ( blank ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you selected one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the bottom of the scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the palette . you can select a fixed position of this list using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse scroll ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the file is currently in &amp; graphic viewer ; charged file from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re @-@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change the change later , you can change your decision later , you can set up the menu option settings as graphic viewer ; see , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite pattern outside a running &amp; graphic viewer ; an instance , &amp; eg , in a file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; an instance or want to present the graph in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but you can also change it with the furnishings dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the programme , you can open all graphs of your last meeting . again , you can save your choice either as well as change later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be displayed on this page . thereby , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one on several pages sub@@ merged without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the page again allows the possibility to set the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk , and eg , by another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page Open gives the opportunity to specify the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer ; when a graph is opened outside a current session , you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
the site management page gives the possibility to set up the launch behavior of &amp; D @-@ viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked at any start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears in one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears more possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ lay@@ outs algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ ite ; are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for targeted graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or cle@@ ated representations of cont@@ ested graphs . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as little as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for power graphs . it produces images according to the spring@@ board model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistics of multiple @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm is created for in@@ stituted graphs , a spring@@ board model layout . it uses the frustration of clean @-@ pure gold @-@ style , and includes a multi @-@ cat@@ cher for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm calcul@@ ates the k@@ not circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ eur and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such layout command you can give &amp; eg . the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ algorithms specific options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of the graph ( directed or ung@@ ed ) and uses the default algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invalid graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the overview will appear if necessary . otherwise , it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse cursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further aid to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; tools to display . it needs the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; D @-@ viewer ; to use in the menu settings you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five parts : the main tool@@ bar , the box for string tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette , and the grid net in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialogue with which you can select whether the icon is to be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew . &quot;
&quot; represents the last revers@@ ed step back . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
inser@@ ts the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new picture ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey . this can produce colors that do not match with those of the symbol @-@ range of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
&quot; does not change the icon , but sets the current character color on the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixel size , the size factor and the current number of colours of the symbol . &quot;
inser@@ ts the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new picture ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; establish a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbols . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons , ... , Edit ... and removing the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; select Transpar@@ ent pixels or insert lin@@ e@@ als and exhibit mono@@ chrome . you can also adjust the size : the Kar@@ os on Small , Medium and Groß as well as color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read tools to read new images and to get them off .
this module can be used to read and improve new images by external sources . currently two sources can be used :
&quot; images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner that supports through the SA@@ NE project or another source like video streams . so that this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE . &quot;
&quot; when you scan the menu item , a dialog box that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the standard source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values named duc@@ r@@ he to select your image accordingly . see the preview of the image below . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete . here you can select the compression and type of image file . here you can also select the compression and type of image file . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
screen images you can create after you have chosen in the menu impor@@ ters &gt; Screen photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all your own program window is selected , the available program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be logged in after a short delay , the currently visible place of work . if you have read the entire work@@ space , only the window under the mouse read . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long the scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you have to switch to other workplaces , you should have to select this delay high enough to get the time to navigate . &quot;
after the scre@@ enshot has been made the dialog options of the target picture with the options described above .

&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to get a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alisation , then you need to load a trace files using GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data from the same time at the same places as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded a automatic correlation is carried out the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will need to be implemented with the time zone . this can be done with time zone .
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ ou@@ eit . if the devi@@ ation , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace dates from a place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation@@ is set in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates are set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since dialogue is the coordinates of a call to the next , you only have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ alization can also be found with the shown map and gradually be found . select the relevant region and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ Per@@ form it always by until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card needs to be changed manually , the card can be switched between card mode , satellite screen and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang on the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ tool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character is UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows all the albums to select according to HTML . you don &apos;t need to select these albums . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area among them the Al@@ ben@@ ding Pres@@ ses and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely explic@@ able . the option for each image will create a page in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg . Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all their affiliated images , select a folder on which you are entitled to write . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ AC@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the JP@@ EG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with Other colour depth you can change the default color @-@ deep . the file size naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails permits you some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progression window shows the user how far the action is . push down@@ ward to break the process .
&quot; when the module generated the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program &apos;s posts to determine whether errors occurred during the generation . the web browser is automatically opened in the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press Connect to finish the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I portrait is a very fast and flexible OpenGL technique to look at images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image is allowed to watch a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or reloc@@ ating . the observer can be used with short text display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after starting a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the IP@@ I JP@@ EG los@@ sy module is a tool to change images without imp@@ air your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save the actions listed below , images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses at quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ free storage is to increase the file size , since no compression of the paint formations takes place . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format again . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool to allow you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata , currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list of k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I teams . &quot;
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ adata , you can copy the data from one image to another . then select the import function in the main program and then you want to copy the import function afterwards , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you have pushed the button OK . &quot;
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a Sli@@ deshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ ders can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV the slides . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a wall@@ paint for your DVD disc . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module . &quot;
the images you select are then placed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting the images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ adjusted and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast to a very smooth change of image . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next to the next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the created file you can set it under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . thereby , you retain the extension mp@@ g as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can easily drink a coffee and enjoy the slides , when you &apos;re back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages across the button settings . &quot;
&quot; the printer assistant will print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes , the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp . this is for example : useful to improve you or to print with the Gimp module into direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original sense of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your companion . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ b better results !
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image verter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re@@ convert the values again to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the whit@@ eboard . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be improved . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to frequently edit your pictures or later on , you should not use the JP@@ EG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data .
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start with the execute button button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; batch mode mode allows you to convert different pictures to once . use this mode for example if you are sure , e.g. through testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to re@@ write the existing file automatically . however , this is helpful in case those made in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress beam shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following picture formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a record . you can put the pre@@ fix , the starting p@@ unch and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the record . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a collection collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can scale the image smaller or enlarge . these are four types of picture change available :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size changes in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is altered by this option .
&quot; print preparation : preparing the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , boundary and background color , is accordingly adapted . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the missing images beforehand . further pictures can be drawn to the list of displayed images and drop there .
&quot; after you started the module , the images window will be shown with the pictures selected by you . you can add more pictures to the image below . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the image list and disc@@ ard it to add the list of images to be displayed .
with the button image you will remove the selected images from the list of the images to be displayed .
after you selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses below and the subject . the pictures you selected are already attached .
do not take care of sending many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be stored and every@@ time re until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your machine . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a remote file , the comments on the images will be attached to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss of photo formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; when you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format , and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original extru@@ dates are added to the lower images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down the status news , in search of errors , look at . your e @-@ mail program will automatically be started at the end . with the button Connect , you can switch this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have shown your slides . you can choose between the pictures selected and select all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option of OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation will be activated by very elegant image transm@@ issions using OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slides can be very slow . &quot;
the option names indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an end loop . you can then manually cancel it with ess@@ c .
&quot; the option pictures to choose random@@ ly , ensures that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it will not be used the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; under delay between the images , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set in 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your machine and the selected transition effect . you should be au@@ st@@ ably before you show your friends presentation ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly chosen from each transition between the images another effect .
&quot; during the slides , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the gas@@ h@@ au . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ tate currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the surface .
&quot; this module presents the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE employer . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; through this browser , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you entered information as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the images are displayed , on which both individuals are visible . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a couple of single images . &quot;
&quot; when you selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view images to view the images of your range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store with &amp; photo@@ sets ; however , for each person to record their own image , this is of course also for places , keywords and other categories which you have defined themselves . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that is located to the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display a list of keywords for each category ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must also specify which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you need to see the image text editor , as shown in the picture . here you can choose the picture window as shown in the text box . in the text box you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes , and select which part of the image should be displayed and cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you access the listing , you will see a dialog box that is very similar to the dialogue for the soli@@ ds of the image properties . this dialog allows you to look at the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description , the signs and descriptions of images will be searched for this text . if you like , you can also enter a date according to the search date ; the date can either be part of the total date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here you can see pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the manual book for &amp; paste album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather like to try out the features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; paste album , and check out the quick entry , the screen photos and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; cr@@ acks album ; and choose in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; cr@@ acks album ; for the first time , or choose in the menu help the menu item @-@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . as a result , some example images are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; cr@@ acks album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an integral HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; cr@@ acks album ; see the tim@@ eline . you can see the tim@@ eline . as the name suggests , this le@@ list shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar displays a different unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by pointing just 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline you can use to change the following modes : you can select the displayed entries from the database file ( if you select a date , the first picture will display this date in the thumb@@ nails displayed ) and also shows the tim@@ eline the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the Pre@@ view View . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline , will be displayed in the preview view only images of this period . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; provide you with two options available to create HTML @-@ websites with your pictures . the one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ sets ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; photo@@ sets ; integrated version which you can create via the HTML file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML @-@ pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , any area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the Over@@ view and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is created ; the export file is to be seen on the overview page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed on the viewer also without description . for example , all pictures from a party . remember that all pictures from a party . remember that all pictures are exported from a party . you cannot use this option to hide certain images from certain watching . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can define how the HTML @-@ pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why it is not specifically made to these . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewers can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger , it turns to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folder and the URL where your website will be stored . &quot;
&quot; best , choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added at the next time . here you can select either a folder or from K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if they really are all visible for viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , after the pages have been created , the URL you should set up here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy it to the final destination folder . thus , the import function , see correctly , you will need to specify the final aim of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the options described below have been related to all three basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you specify in output formats . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; col@@ lar album ; come together , you might want to apply a HTML page to viewing the pictures . of course , you have to apply a HTML page to viewing the pictures , etc. then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ sets ; this work will not even go . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; paste album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file , whether the images are stored in the file , or if the file is only connected to the file , so that you can share all images and that file can be distributed as independent . however , the obvious downside is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file exporting ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in a different way . first , the images are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures are not found , so that the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files . this is of course possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the exporting of images is described , which you can view through the Ex@@ porting Menu ... &quot;
&quot; the main option of this dialog is , whether it is to act at internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . it offers you the following three choices : &quot;
&quot; when using the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Autom@@ atic option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; paste album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; in the files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed using JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually does not comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , just select the option Export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is a maximum size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file will otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Editor ... select , becomes &amp; cr@@ photo@@ album , which exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import is made up of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category persons of the to imported file , i.e. if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , you are to be imported in the third dialogue window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories use them in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can remove the categories of the file imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is displayed in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse images and to see : when you see pictures , one often want to look inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the p@@ ecting and prestige , through to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for ste@@ war@@ ts of your pictures . however , it was extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; it stores all the information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml and stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . this is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ conditioning in the CV@@ S , where you would like . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; remembers the folder in which your pictures are stored and used it for future start . if you want to enter another database in &amp; photo@@ album , so you can start a different folder tree ; with the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; on the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album , set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; paste album ; in the following section of the user guide you will discuss the various settings options . &quot;
&quot; you can view six different icons , with which you can view the creation of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed assistance is available that you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it has been described , as you can set for each picture different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available to you to the feast of the members groups , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right @-@ hand list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphics applications such as Pub@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called up via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; cr@@ acks album ; but , but are distributed separately . however , most of the modules do have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared with each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ sets ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always use the command line with the command &gt; on photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; above \ &gt; or through the menu help . don &apos;t say I would not have been warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; cr@@ acks album ; not work . this is the downside when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ sets ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are using their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; in this case , simul@@ ated &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images , which shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album I have to pass on a list of albums ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes on the red album : as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is the category that you have defined in setting dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , use the category people , becomes &amp; ca@@ vern@@ ous album ; so do you have selected people to view and pass this module to this module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the installation dialog and select in the range module , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see an example of the screen , as soon as you go on the photo@@ album , with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , take a look at the top of a menu and tool@@ bar . at the moment you can browse the window , as you do not have any information about your pictures here . in the section we will display some information about your pictures , now click on the entry show that shows you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes . this includes information about the people who are recorded on the picture , etc . you can display each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments , when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ sets , as you will always use it again if you need information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to adjust the shifting of images within the list : if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find and assign the people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to list an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the images and back buttons , which are located below the preview of the picture right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to highlight all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at one time with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window which shows the USA as an overseas group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the indication , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new super@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drop a entry to a category and store it in order to sort this one sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the indication to move by clicking the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also pull out a separate window by setting it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; when you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button below ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also fade away a frame even completely . if you want to see this window later , use the button below ... and then window a / out . this process will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select the entry images in the browser you get an overview with thumb@@ nail of the currently selected images , or any pictures in case you have no filter . for example , you can view the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply down dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture . if you do not have a window opened with a picture view , a new ad window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also remove images from which you want to delete . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and select either the Edit button , or select in the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use it on the hard disk . of course , you must also use the pictures somewhere , so you can see the pictures from the disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures , in which the upper upper left is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so you can preview photos of these images . however , these images can not be viewed with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires that you would like to copy files from folders and re @-@ copy . &amp; photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid trouble on getting your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk in order to store all the pictures on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the pictures so that you may end up those who want to see for other in@@ accessible and click &quot; Cur@@ rent View &quot; menu . alternatively , you can also choose to view all images that block your little sister and choose the menu entry from all out of current view . &quot;
&quot; with this you have set the pictures in the case of the case shall be hidden . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , creating all images that you have locked again . if you want to see the pictures again , click at Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one you can access or delete all images on the disk . this type of password protection is only used to those who are working with &amp; photo@@ sets ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you want all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ sets ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at it at some point . for this reason it has a picture _ and video view . this is what you can start from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . it shows naturally the picture , but additional all the information you want to enter the image , e.g. who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it . you can also configure what information is displayed and if all these options are displayed after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then the text @-@ menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the info@@ box are underlined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can change between them and go back by clicking the buttons painting high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer you can run it as a Sli@@ deshow . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new picture can be controlled by pressing the Str@@ g button and plus or minus . stopped and hal@@ ted the po@@ asch@@ au through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; s .
&quot; a very useful capacity of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , it is able to change in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete position on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move in the image and perform zo@@ oming . to the herr@@ n button you can simply drag a rec@@ tan@@ gle over the middle of the picture . it shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ tan@@ gle highlighted in the middle of the picture and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom so that the picture is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ itable setting sets the zo@@ oms , so each pixels on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations working in videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and repeat ones .
&quot; with the screen@@ functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the actual picture with the menu item comment from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen , you will find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten in the picture . at the moment you can view the drop and configur@@ ing dialog of the picture to indicate this name . however , you will probably prefer to highlight the picture and look at more pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while you look at one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while watching them . characteristics are the characters A to Z and you can set a feature that you push the appropriate letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , these are available to you in your browser . so if you have selected all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can just add all the pictures to copy the selected images to a CD , or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can display in the thumb@@ nail view . if you view the categories in D@@ re view view , then you can press features to the images by simply press the characters for the feature after the image is selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case allows you to paint on the photo album .
the mixture will not be stored with the image but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
&quot; in turn , you can see a picture on the painted old . to finish the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; select the painting from the context menu . to end the photo , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar panel at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; work to work , you need to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully dominate but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray . should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can choose single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and display the object in the wire @-@ wire views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , as all accommodation objects have already been selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar , or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multi @-@ possible positions , the following fold @-@ down menu appears as you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click to apply to apply these changes . if you entered new values , a message with a error description will be displayed . then you can click the input errors and apply changes to Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the interior dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview of his / her style view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the original view and a small example of the scene will be hin@@ dered with the chosen texture . as a default item , the entire texture is en@@ cro@@ pped , even if you want to use a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you crosses locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for reloc@@ ating . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has an visibility level . you can specify this value relative to visibility of the superior object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the level of tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window order or if you need a different order , you can set them as you want . you can also store several shut@@ ters and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle will then show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views of each other , drag the Beg@@ asser right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the card &apos;s card top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window of window are so@@ aring opinions : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to redeem a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click the small to the left arrow at the Start side@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the little cross at the Start side@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for every kind of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them to any point . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window @-@ order ... save it . it will display a dialogue in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ame them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual has been written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the icon rendering the icon rendering in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can set as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View modes ... choose , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can input any name , but it is a name that can detect the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the linear image . if you only want a small area of the image , select the cross@@ wise sub@@ section and enter the picture @-@ section for ren@@ ders into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual about &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; when an image appears with only a ray of pixels , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é @-@ pattern or stool effects in turns and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a ray of pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighbouring pixel is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively because each pixels is repeat@@ ed@@ ely divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion lines depends on the calculated shades . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds pixels , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a lowering of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixels . if the difference between the h@@ ue exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel that can be followed individually and can be tested on further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the production of smoke for the ray process , called j@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays get a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it will take a very long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
this card card allows you to adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray takes place . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in dialogue window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command @-@ cat@@ cher of &amp; Pov@@ ray . if when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialogue window lists a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , please write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ C@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree in the editor to export source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds to the code text to the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the code text in the Editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is a Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the self @-@ style view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation of the indicated object . set the path to your documentation and the version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you need files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different ways of library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the colour of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the field of sight in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can adjust the item @-@ cat@@ ches of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model . you can set here the r@@ aster separate for reloc@@ ations , sc@@ aling and rotating . &quot;
&quot; greater values result in an exact wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the objects shown , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level of detail for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you crosses high amounts of details for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera is a extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; if you have a wall , a wall behind the objects will be hin@@ dered . the wall is shown in a box pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you tap ground , a soil below the objects will be hin@@ dered . the soil is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you activate Canton , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method for rendering the scenes will be used . the values for depth and swelling can set you . exact details on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window assignments or create new window assignments . in the section window @-@ orders it is explained , as you create window arrangement and save windows . &quot;
the Com@@ missions standard set @-@ up : displays all existing window assignments . &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window @-@ order in the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window orders shows all existing window systems . a new order can be created with the &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button and to remove a selected order with the button below . &quot;
each shut@@ down order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name indicates all views of the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button Add and remove selected views with the button removing .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ obstruc@@ ted view the window under the existing window , with cardboard card , the view is not anchored in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; B &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you are following all steps in this guide , you should be able to create simple scene amongst the beg@@ inner very popular : one bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully note the following warnings before you complain that you as a result receive only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything wrong installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following set of window : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of tool@@ bar . please read documentation , so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; these menus and symbols must now be used frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starting with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Dele@@ te . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . especially note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you see the content of the view properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; change anything about the basic settings in the camera , this is correct instructions , but note that the camera in the view points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you use the button or press the button bar , the wire model views and the object tree instantly change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert for example a Qu@@ ader ( insert end@@ ental body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a te@@ dious method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simple possibility . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or insert the button bar . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model view also shows the plain , although at the moment it shows only a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level stretches into the horizon up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can click the entry for the ground when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should shift the soil to exercise a unity under the horizon line , just to get some of these parameters to get acquainted . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just choose the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a blue black material because you still need to input settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you always remember the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest for them now . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see color on the Qu@@ ader and ball in the Pre@@ view , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is right now . if you are facing your image with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called mono@@ gam@@ er . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the item properties :
&quot; you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have understood the basic functionality of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball just as simple as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in view of the properties Properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button to press ) , so the ball would float above the ground because you have moved the ground to a unit down@@ stairs . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as previously seen , the ball @-@ surface looks like a black @-@ black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you . as already at the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
select sub@@ object and change the name for example in the ball pig@@ ment . click the ball pig@@ ment which then select one @-@ colour and set the values as follows :
&quot; but you can achieve more exciting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the input button .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection has already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler offers . hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a multi @-@ dimensional method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ s , the rendering hyp@@ er hyp@@ othe@@ tical bla@@ zes out of the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that affect the scenes ) by the objects in the scene and how this beam will affect the visual effects of light sources , such as fog . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , each scene needs to be hin@@ dered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
&quot; open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot;
displays the scene back in the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
&quot; this menu entry can only select , if you have not saved changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , to the last revers@@ ed order . this menu entry can only select if you have used editing set@@ backs . &quot;
&quot; stores the current window order and opens up a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands with this option to change the keyboard .
&quot; opens up a dialog to set up the tool@@ box . you can add and remove the commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , using this option . &quot;
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to switch off @-@ surface finishes , without changing any b@@ ump on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself . &quot;
&quot; it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a B@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map . &quot;
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as components : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hund@@ red@@ ths of this basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object paint on pixels base , using a image file as color ticket . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient picture @-@ viewing and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in either own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
&quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files , which you can display with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return . &quot;
you can set if each image is displayed in a separate window or whether all images are to use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file window in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if an appropriate fil@@ en@@ ame appears , the file will be highlighted by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ cape . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue inser@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and Processing and slideshow , you can set the working mode of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short commands and short command for the browser , the ke@@ ystro@@ kes can be defined for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the images are open in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show opens ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a wall@@ paint . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen mode in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the picture , the window will be filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can create &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up , that only some of the file types will display , which can display the program . &quot;
this option is switched on the full screen for large pictures . this option is switched as default .
determine if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time period between the image changes at a slideshow . to change the value , you can input a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is thrown down by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or insert the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . &quot;
change here the short@@ cut for the different types of modes of &amp; glob@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the box cards short @-@ command for the display window and a short command for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays big symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short description .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short description .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .

&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ piece ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo processing based on the &amp; writing ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the publication ; project .
&amp; show@@ piece ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to watch your photos and implement correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; it &apos;s the show@@ piece ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to this part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ piece ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or potential improvements . this indicates a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all necessary information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to send your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ piece ; is a project which is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ piece ; however , we would like to answer your questions to other users of the show@@ piece ; however , in this mailing list will English spoken , you should therefore be powerful of this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in the show@@ piece ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ foto ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ piece ; try to specify as much control of its work processes as possible . if you access these settings , you have to change in the menu settings again . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed when the lower or over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator should be selected . fortun@@ at@@ ly should show colors with what you should show , in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show@@ piece ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions on the selected images . you can also find them in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&quot; &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for the scan of images , which does not make more than images to scan and increase . &quot;
&quot; &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it is a simple application to scan images that doesn &apos;t make more than images to scan and to reduce the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the screen . &quot;
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project by entering the necessary information on this search site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ tit@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ be / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to select the scanner and push OK to open the scanner . break down and end .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview and then scan Scan@@ area for the final scan . the preview can be started through the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can enter the image and from the current selection of zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the zoom in the window that the entire preview is in the window . &quot;
&quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when storing a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a showcase , as shown below is displayed . when saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and s@@ lie ? go to a break and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; with the button settings , the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image , if desired , before saving a preview . in this case , the option is to be selected before storing a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option has to be rep@@ licated . &quot;
&quot; this option allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images will be able to select the dialog prior to each image opening up the dialog prior to each image . if you want to save it automatically with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to be saved without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images can be saved at the option Save without saving after a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder will be used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically mem@@ orized images and is furthermore the suggested name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets highly counted , when a picture is stored . the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality for saving image quality . this value is also changing the compression value when saving you , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button help will start the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button About start the K@@ DE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings indicates the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses just like all other programs short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this abbrevi@@ ation and their function . down the global keyboard short@@ el you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select a short command above ...
&quot; you may be able to set up existing multimedia keys so that they are working as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; therefore , make your keyboard to the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Am@@ aro@@ K has many general features , which usually can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist and scripts . an example of example for the D@@ COP &apos;s function might look for example : &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ K supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Am@@ aro@@ K still has some own command @-@ line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of missing dependency . please check your script , whether all necessary modules are available and you can use dialog , so that the user is not running . &quot;
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is open for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit exit
&quot; in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Am@@ aro@@ K and Am@@ aro@@ K . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
&quot; most of the scrip@@ ting languages enable the output of external programs and commands . this way , the function ex@@ ec is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple is called . here an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; send noti@@ fications on all running scripts . therefore , strings on the standard version of the script . for this reason , scripts have continuously monitored their standard input and according to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure We@@ is the script to display the furnishings dialog . to store the storing and loading of the furnishings , each script must take care of each script . when a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k sets the working folder to the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece will be played . the script should now ask for example ; with dop@@ ing functions more information to the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece @-@ length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le . disclosure the path to the selected files of the playlist . in order to add the script to the selected item you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; finished , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed so as to do space @-@ operate . for example , saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ ks script management can also install script packages which can download the user &amp; eg . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly detect the archive as Am@@ aro@@ k script package . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Exten@@ ded amar@@ ine script . for this reason you should name your script packages right properly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) which should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s right :
&quot; when your script is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script side by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; attached . for your listing on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; script . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus within your collection . perhaps , you just search a very specific title from thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s gathering browser and quick search for you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the play@@ e browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ K has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used , so you can hear your music . this and yet many more useful features make Am@@ aro@@ K for the most advanced audio player . Am@@ aro@@ K is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music again ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the following sub@@ folders of the Am@@ aro@@ K springs in order to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ K : &quot;

&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; as most applications have some options , which you can activate or disable the configure script via the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details for this can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; if you want to use it full . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without hesitation via the furnishings . the interior dialog has multiple card cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; player window displays the Player window , in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option runs the experimental function of the m@@ ime l@@ om@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; set @-@ up design : this feature is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thus , the color scheme for the m@@ bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; add m@@ oods files at the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this option is activated , then files are stored at the storage location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ be files in the Settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; otherwise , these settings are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K should be started , when a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; playlist upon saving , saves the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist upon the end of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; actual piece in the piece @-@ change appears to hold out that the play@@ lists pop up / down , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when modi@@ fying the context @-@ browser changes automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section section you can customize &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section .
&quot; in the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; otherwise , you can choose the following section : playlist windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user @-@ defined colour scheme , you yourself have the tor@@ ment of choice and you can specify a piece of color scheme . use the included color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; after the program start playing the playback automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it stopped in the last cont@@ end . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window On @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is indicated , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross @-@ field shadow brings about , that the text is sh@@ aded in the OS@@ D . &quot;
&quot; own colors will give you the possibility to adapt the OS@@ D colors for scrip@@ ture and background . a click on the color @-@ surfaces opens the dialog to suit color . if self @-@ colour colors do not use activated , the curtains and colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the text box text shows the text shown in the OS@@ D . through the type of space , the OS@@ D can be adjusted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available space holder and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen mode is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to define , on which screen a multi @-@ fold monitor environment the OS@@ D should appear . &quot;
the cardboard card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate even further settings in this card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; browse for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the tick field next to its name . this section also includes an@@ alogue fields for setting how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folders recur@@ sively well : this leads , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to be seen as well as their sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; to monitor these changes : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) , a incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists into your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then appear later in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part of the collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the configuration box driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another facility is needed in the My@@ S@@ ql establishment . &quot;
&quot; the section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ Interior is used for setting up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; under calcul@@ ator , the computer will enter , on which the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ database is located . after that , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is at@@ tainable . name : is the Database name , to which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card @-@ card ran@@ .@@ f@@ m is designed to support al@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can send the names of played st@@ acks to a load .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your download@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can sign up one on the load .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send pieces and update the profile : this attitude allows it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your rel@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activ@@ ating this setting is called &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece will be retri@@ eved . you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a load @-@ load profile to be able to use this function .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg . Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery using screen photos .
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ oo@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have installed K@@ delicate ( including the included in it ) , because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to compile e.g. modules or scripts . we have written a small guide , how to compile C@@ oo@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D bet that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . G@@ NO@@ ME will work for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will prepare difficulties . we &apos;re trying to support Am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use cr@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these constitute an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; most likely , one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . then you can delete this error by cras@@ hing . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , this is that Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bus@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is a little mature .
&quot; make sure all of the same compiler version are compiled using the same compiler version . if for example &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to crash at the editing of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then turn automatic . off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically open to a cras@@ hing ) . if it is a common crash , and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program data can be used as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a info , but this does not feature Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynam@@ ics playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 always actively . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbols will be activated on grey and half @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : top box : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then check whether Am@@ aro@@ K is used the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos;@@ that amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;s _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf file that Am@@ aro@@ K will first find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ nau@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please enter there only one error if something is located at the removal of an error in Am@@ aro@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; only a blank playlist will appear . how are music pieces there now ?
&quot; this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start -@@ sub@@ window is converted into the statistics window . you will find it under special statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ K 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces in the playlist you have to display the rating column ; click on the title bar of the playlist and select column evaluation . you can also use the short command @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Am@@ aro@@ K is in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press En@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and select from playlist you remove from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist , and let them fall , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . take a look after li@@ b@@ ating , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides you can find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that is really true ! no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question are loud which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and p@@ n@@ g . &quot;
&quot; it can ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 de@@ file will be supplied ( for patent @-@ related reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the hand@@ some driver with the al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you find the issue of issue and help a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ cope ) . &quot;
&quot; that is doing &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ co@@ ded to Al@@ sa , you would only look for a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server for highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buff@@ ers in your al@@ sa @-@ interior file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; you will probably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine drivers has been optimized strong for analysis ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less recei@@ pts are responding to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; from why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg down , compile and install it . perform G@@ ST file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST reg@@ istrar at once . start now &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
please report about it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ .@@ e. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes to send them the best to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net

&quot; thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and release the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; run before you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken by the gentle sounds of the music that you have stopped prior to bed . &quot;
how can you find the current title in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; current titles if you are on a different computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this order command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ window , push this on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is open in an independent , in the size changeable windows . &quot;
the combination of strings + rights mouse button represents a piece in the client sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button in search of a search in the playlist will run the first search result and re@@ set the search .

&quot; basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less impact each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can register the rating for a piece of yourself by clicking on a column cap@@ tion in the play@@ lists window . then you can select the evaluation of a piece just as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and edit : review or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in dialog Met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to show you when you want to publish a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release schedule , which will not work together with the short @-@ term plan of Am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;

&quot; probably , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compile , before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must configure these output modules ; new configure and install . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably use a distribution that installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , you need to install the required development files . you now need to install the package de@@ g@@ amer de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you must compile and install the package . &quot;

I have a second sound@@ card and use Al@@ sa . how can be used with Am@@ aro@@ K the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Am@@ aro@@ K set up ... audio output you give the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ r@@ erec@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ w &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } C@@ l@@ .@@ se 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the interior dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scanning , channels and so on ) . &quot;

&quot; the play@@ lists browser shaped the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the lower part of the play@@ lists contains the intelligent play@@ lists . this use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database , to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time automatically . the intelligent play@@ lists consist of : &quot;
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even itself , Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;

&quot; under the tool@@ bar is a search area , with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list , all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser you can enter a address list , with which you can enter music from a URL . for example tar / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz enter and input button , you can move to music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz . now you can pull the music from there into the playlist and drop . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the hanging of files can be tricky . in the case the holding of the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the playlist enh@@ alls all of you to play @-@ in pieces . you can change the order by entering the mouse on the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filters , you press as long as the back@@ pack until the text box is empty again . &quot;

&quot; if you enter between the search parameters , will be sought after entries , which either contain one or the other search term . for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries , the spaces are included , then en@@ close the search term with ge@@ ese @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries to do by Mike Old@@ field , but not by returns such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a particular search column , you can also look for larger or less . for example : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces which have a higher rating as 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain phrase , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for mosquit@@ oes that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these par@@ sing modes after exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this searches for all pieces , which contain either Mike &apos;s field , or have a higher rating as 50 and not contain the comment . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the order sequence of entries by holding the Str@@ g button down , and then with the right mouse button in the desired sequence click on the entries . the entries will then be displayed with one number . the number corresponds to the order , where the pieces will be reproduced . &quot;

&quot; next , the buttons are turning back and restore . this allows you to re@@ vert or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , you can find a unique , enlarged analytical . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the final button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that , which you see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more buttons for tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and select tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the play@@ time of the current piece . moreover , the status of random mode and playback is easy to change by clicking with the mouse Double in the respective display area . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . please disable the date of the status bar in general settings .
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . over this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization @-@ plug @-@ in . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
the Cover @-@ Administration is a useful tool for managing your Cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover @-@ Administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left .
&quot; with the menu view , you can choose what is to be displayed in the Cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; queue administration received your large deposit in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; to manage the queue you open via extra queue administration . if you want to add a piece in the playlist , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can easily add the pieces to the playlist or change the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already given ( the details about setting up this follow later ) . &quot;
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add some other pieces to playback .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m - Recommen@@ dations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) added . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you do not need a load @-@ load profile to work this dynamic playlist .
&quot; click on the desired playlist , drag them into the play@@ lists window , or click on it . in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist , so under circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ recorded modes , fill up your playlist , and you can start playing directly . the playlist that begins with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as start @-@ point . over the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be activated again . &quot;
&quot; the button rest@@ ores the current playlist , and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens up to manipulate the settings of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they will be no more double in this playlist . if the setting is active , the pieces will already be removed , taking the attitude of the pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept in the beginning of the playlist . therefore , you can easily see which pieces were played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each play piece to the playlist . if you set up more than 1 , the playlist is continuously growing , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you have multiple play@@ lists , then &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; random pieces from each of the tou@@ ted play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by launching the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts installed by installing the script . after you install the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . use the button for more scripts . &quot;
&quot; if you no longer wish to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select the script to un@@ install the script then click on un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your scripts , please see the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue window visu@@ alization @-@ plug @-@ ins is used as an activation of available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the cross @-@ box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD in four steps ; to trace the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
&quot; this is a dialogue window , in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD . &quot;
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , then remember that you will receive a to@@ ken quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check whether an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the project out CD@@ ROM ect . &quot;
in this dialogue window you can do nothing . wait for the machine to complete the burn process .
&quot; this Quick Start is to show you how to copy &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to trace the steps , you have to have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and have put the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to Copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burning . &quot;

&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; does all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore offers and extends these functions even . therefore choose &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
&quot; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as Ripper . &quot;
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio @-@ enco@@ ding and for handling audio data stream . O@@ GG fores@@ kin benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Dec@@ oder module . &quot;
&quot; ame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial use . L@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module . &quot;
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ sy @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C Dec@@ oder module and the external audio @-@ Encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn it onto an audio CD . &quot;
&quot; So@@ x : an aid program , which can go up and convert between different audio formats . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module . &quot;
&quot; trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing , you need it if you want to read a DVD . &quot;
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the function@@ ally fully equipped author system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool becomes a standard used for adapting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for creating fil@@ tered CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections will be useful ; without norm@@ alize the different recording of the different albums could lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces can be reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it includes the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects re@@ charge . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save below is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
saves all the opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to save for each individual project file saving .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project changed and has not been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . besides , you can also break down and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; exclu@@ des all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any saved project , what should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file Close . &quot;
&quot; exclu@@ des all opened projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any saved project will be asked , what should be done so as if you were called this file . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select about the appearing dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you move files directly from the top view into the Project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added are included in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opening the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the features of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings that most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . he has led &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session will be included in the current project . this is useful for you to be used for you , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can already see existing files and folders using existing files . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD instead of normal copying . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ oning off when you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can only be able to create a DVD with the help of copying and then the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; let you choose between writing mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ Res@@ cue oder * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which is then instantly posted by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an previously loaded DVD video can be converted . thereby , this dialogue window appears usually used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all @-@ standing video , code settings and even ways of changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the specified medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ ing of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a little le@@ list is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view turns out or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a text menu with features such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the run or throw @-@ out of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the view turns out or off . the view is possible to select and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view was selected . &quot;
&quot; the head @-@ list is an narro@@ wer section in the project view . the head @-@ list is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the proj@@ ector has open projects . the head @-@ list has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ections clear from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialogue window for changing the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . after having one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ word order below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assistant . thus , the proper per@@ missions can be adjusted for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system managers are needed , therefore you must enter the password for the system admin@@ ter ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b may function . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and for the refinement of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in functionality , hence it &apos;s more of your taste and type of task . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use scripts before , you must advance to ensure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features such functions as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions to witness new projects . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ readable for &amp; col@@ de ; . with it , simply can be saved audio CD ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder which is installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ ders that contain these W@@ AV files ( loss of loss ) , which can be added from the Linux distribution ( if you have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and saved in W@@ AV files on your computer ( loss of loss and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the loss of FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled an pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step we need to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions available . however , if the code is not used , its installation is also not necessary . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File @-@ Format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer provides a small introduction to co@@ aster , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not intended to handle any copy protection ; even if not the mechanism of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up should be made only once ( the interior dialog can be viewed as often as possible ) , later the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can transform into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD : get information from the free@@ DB from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , using everything manually . &quot;
this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s tab for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts the excerpt and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Control Panel tab in the ordering file - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with another Encoder can be read as the default one . it is to note that previously the Encoder in the tab , code settings in the furnishings dialog was configured . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already out@@ done file will be selected for enco@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the interior dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; stop ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main entrance dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , to setup of the en@@ code ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right co@@ worker . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &quot; &quot; shor@@ ten &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; monkey &quot; &quot; which may possibly be available for this distribution . cons are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information obtained through data compressed depending on your psycho@@ ac@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but are less important about these bit@@ rate as both enco@@ ders are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , however , it will still be delivered with most distri@@ butions for free but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG units is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at first 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters to the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Medium &apos; = This setting opens up good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = These setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression @-@ rate approximately 5.5 . needs more and 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older units need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression @-@ rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good fortune for music of juven@@ iles , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ ks . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information which is inserted manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the free@@ DB , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / needed to create the folder and file name , as well as the attributes of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ ding programs , there are often a combination of programs for the code and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches has to be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like that : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button drawing in the wizard ) :
&quot; that is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of your computer instead : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ no@@ m of the super@@ visor ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ licted . any information may be given in any bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; ca@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to actively select a cross @-@ field ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used at retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only be the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; up to the use of free@@ DB , ge@@ ographi@@ cally will be used at the next lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org offers a current list of mir@@ r@@ ored servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually posted monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files stored on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more specifically , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see for sure that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed at first , if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to save the loaded W@@ AV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ ding package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the enco@@ ders can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ans are in the chapter of Space Ko@@ di@@ zer .
&quot; after installing a code , you can get more information about the switches by typ@@ ing a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a single window ( eg . console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check out the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the ty@@ pe@@ - and les@@ hooting of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a hint of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD . this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; did you read the complete manual , all understood but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to create everything and our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s using a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords .
&quot; you have to install c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , what you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ ened up on it ( eg by trying to copy something inside with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set of &amp; ca@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which probably only once done once , and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each listing &amp; CD .
here we determine the used code for compres@@ sing the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) and which structure is used . as we are lazy we split the program to load the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change with any reading &amp; CD if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the equipment drawing is handed over to the selection program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD disk is available , so it also helps to access the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the cardboard card General settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will leave or entered the scre@@ enshot as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; only with un@@ complete information can be found , so that you will be notified when information comes to witness of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the cardboard card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD to automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB machines .
&quot; note : the machine must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is immediately linked with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , it can be easily modified using the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example there is further note : if you want to enter all manually , you de@@ activate the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , it is about 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice if this is worth it . to free@@ DB in an off@@ line mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB @-@ server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on free@@ DB . put it all as it is shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and see them for a mirror in your area . on this road , the burden between the machines will be distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equal to the server , as though many fire@@ walls are getting the protocol of 88@@ 80 default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first cross @-@ field switch should be de@@ activated . &quot;
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously out@@ spoken pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time using only an existing drive ? parallel reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the final piece , tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are to tick this an@@ alogue , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the W@@ AV files are stored . this folder can not be clicked , if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all input as it is on the screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something to feed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage power . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of W@@ AV files at the same time : when a Du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ ding more than one W@@ AV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD is running . we will create MP3 files , the way the music is set up on the hard disk . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD is described in this section , must be repeated for each listing &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , the screen photos show a little different from the data for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually put aside from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD is now to be defined into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD is identified ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then search in the section questions and answers about the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully from the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be built , and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross @-@ field for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entry of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo , enter the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the single comments ini@@ di@@ pl@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful call of data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album @-@ names ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to consider whether there is any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and at only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you will have an unlimited field length , at least what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum . this option is displayed on the tab &apos;s tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information generated by the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the enco@@ ders to obtain more information .
simply select an entry which obviously agrees with the style of the out@@ going CD . in this example this is not important as we do not submit the &amp; CD . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the data entered , which we have captured for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . please note that the artist and the album are displayed on the sheet list .
&quot; note that there &apos;s a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected is read . a simple click on the line spl@@ its the selection of the piece or out . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the button all the pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection out of the selection process , so this window will appear to confirm . OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab to turn orders to the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for t@@ mp file and destination folder are not what we have entered here in an example . have you checked whether you write write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the contract 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , to read and co@@ ding simultaneously . notice the status of status in the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing can be configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . with efficient machines the result is unclear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous translation and co@@ ding ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will pop up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; today , within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is present within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . if you are already included in CV@@ S , you can download it from there an anonymous package . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people created by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs if it is running , then the following is true for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different programs has many variants of settings . best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this empty screen ( especially when at the time of the program , no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an unusual short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; but if you are reading this , he has taken this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have been able to catch the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and caravan of &amp; col@@ de ; besides others , he has not recorded some properties with real @-@ time gra@@ fi@@ k and kar@@ aoke @-@ authenticity of texts also some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; running under &amp; Linux , and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also works on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; e@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changeable color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can go in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI @-@ file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window on cap can be activated .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( pol@@ der@@ ship or text events ) . K@@ Mid will automatically select the procedure used .
&quot; session support . if you stop &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , the Mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ we , FM and CIS - cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also leave a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button down in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out the menu item or press the button bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will be added to a collection and then played after each other . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece takes place , you can jump to any passage by using the middle mouse button and proceed with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song becomes too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tem@@ po@@ ad and thus change the velocity speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the lower button is like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , then inter@@ rupt the reproduction . pressing the space bar during no piece is started , starts &amp; col@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics use and another both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set that events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the Ere@@ ign@@ ite type is automatically determined to activate a song , so you have nothing to adjust manually . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a E@@ ign@@ ite type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or song @-@ events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can put together . these are played in the series , as you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to put a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the images in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by adding a song . it appears in turn the file dialog with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic add to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece by opening ( using the file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to an active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically adding to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece is the temporary collection activated and added . this collection will then continue to be added . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on dele@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order where the songs choose from . if you choose the sequence according to the menu item &apos;s menu item , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the next song next song , the entry next song from the menu item or push the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu piece or push the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection of collection and click on the button of Dele@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events translated into events that understands the synthes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map which conver@@ ts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus can always sound the trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI @-@ map , because all Sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS -@@ cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for the playing one piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is achieved . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may offer for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific key@@ boards will be displayed . the general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equality sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and do not draw any line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes , which need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI @-@ file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum @-@ patch the patch is meant , where every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one where the sound means the pitch @-@ height of the always same drums ( as some key@@ boards own ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how sounds are displayed on a certain channel or instrument .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of the lines is very important , as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to make sounds to the per@@ k channel . look for example the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to another . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , make it easy at CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the perc@@ ussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; so MIDI devices require 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option the key@@ map will of course use the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option to change all events that will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case will be always patch x used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k patch on the per@@ k channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates , in which relation Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der events is multiplied . if a MIDI @-@ file converted a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event , then this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then re @-@ passed . the value 40@@ 96 is not used so that in the map file no dec@@ imal ( are ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM adm@@ its that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch , which is supposed to play a pitch higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards around two sounds to play higher . unfortunately , to try to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit &apos; back &apos; . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI @-@ settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole row of Kla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these accus@@ ations see which sounds are being played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selective list , where you can choose an instrument , the button lights not more green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played notes . view in the menu settings below the point of can@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played out . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . this can result the same MIDI @-@ file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; to use it . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a comp@@ compression deposit of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a Bin@@ der distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have this happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support . to remove the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add any files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
activate previously absolutely the setting automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow@@ down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; square ; -@@ desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file only in the &amp; con@@ cord ; click the window and draw the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without having to add them to a collection , turn the setting automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection added . opening files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , on to programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ dison ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , making music and prove things . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me feel happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ pil@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really want to send me a great pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard , or a MIDI file , but if you want to get a MIDI file , you should contact me because I already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it . I would therefore like to stress , that I can only program further , because when I get feedback messages from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Ke@@ ep the error that the pitch is too high at A@@ we @-@ Cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ we @-@ support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Mr. Ulrich Cor@@ des , and anyone who sent me a patch , a bug , or only a supportive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html page . you will find links to sites with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer as the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it is not the same as you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send a error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is an easy interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files that are supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet termin@@ ated as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the K@@ DE Website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is formed from so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be shown when information is to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to get the preferred connections under the book@@ marking menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy . if you choose an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the included entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player . not only the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / k@@ m@@ player / , can choose from the menu view and as next processing mode . by the inser@@ tions of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is shown . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu with playlist and select either the processing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes have been lost if the processing mode can be left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can be switched only by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation at the start and end can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and Chan@@ ging of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &quot; &quot; option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily added . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / k@@ m@@ player / / m@@ .x@@ ml / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at startup need not be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , but the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation may be the ads of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; ye@@ e ; &amp; lt ; ye@@ v = &quot; &quot; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; &quot; fit &quot; &quot; = / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = = &quot; &quot; sr@@ c / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; &quot; in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL will be supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; s ) . &quot;
&quot; there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path from the player and the inter@@ memory size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted . &quot;
another tool for de@@ bug is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is performed : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist , XML . &quot;
&quot; to allow the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime @-@ type / / X @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnishings file order of K@@ DE are specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to be started in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the stretched process is cr@@ p@@ added . if there are no mistakes , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime @-@ type is taken ( of course only if this was also identified ) , this must be done by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c. &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV tickets , either using a player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner can be used to use the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; configuration of the V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is to use the dialog in settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR can use only X@@ Video to run X@@ Video ( presumably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server needs to be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 servers it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally by KM@@ Player is used for sources different names . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , dv@@ d@@ nav@@ y , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source , source source . &quot;
are there any indications like I can do my CD@@ ROM drive down when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to perform as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely secure to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine only starts slowly , why should my CPU be tested on their performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is superior . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last recorded value , only the first time x@@ ins will check the CPU . &quot;

most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux system . for the installation you should use the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation must be considered . however , the support for this project or its documentation should be desired , the contact via the ki@@ le ; website . &quot;

the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a available function for fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; it offers some possibilities for creating the document . it can also be made some of the settings @-@ related settings .
&quot; document categories : this is given the type of document printed document : article ( Articles ) , book &#91; Note &#93; , report &#91; Note &#93; , report &#91; certificate &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ am@@ ity &#93; , project ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ am@@ ers &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Users . &quot;

&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( to meet German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users do not have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; it is possible to have a simple problem @-@ seeking text on the screen . however , it is possible to saves you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will saves you through the high@@ lighting time and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic processing of environments , when entering a new command , e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a single command ( for the entry of the text ) and the corresponding line to the end of the text ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be ki@@ cked out in the menu settings , and set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ servi@@ ent element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse @-@ click on the respective switch . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex . once a DV@@ I ; file &#91; controlled file ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer at the corresponding line in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format document and also other information such as the font , and is beside PDF the desired output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ IN@@ I file , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the editor is kno@@ cked and as soon as an element in the DV@@ I ; source code is sc@@ anned out . once upon a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code has been bent , the corresponding page in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer is sc@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; Master @-@ document : this feature is used at work with multiple files . with a master document , the work with other em@@ .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project can be set to project project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ tool@@ ing : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless any errors in the source code are available ) .
&quot; file watch@@ word : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; file on top of the end , and there is no appeal from &amp; oc@@ ular ; according to the quick structure . &quot;
&quot; in responding to the Edit tool@@ bar the three sizes of the selection fields are designed for the quick setup of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The Av@@ ail@@ able &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field More is for selection of articles such as tags , fu@@ sions , or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , one image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a set name ( selection on a selection area ) .
&quot; when using c@@ itation , a selective list is shown with literary events . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors needed . the author has good experience with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¼ cke is used for laying down the font . it can be defined for the main text , the joints , etc . they are the following correspondence to apply : &quot;
&quot; when calling for &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and st@@ acking of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by your hand . &quot;
&quot; brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ document@@ aries contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the fonts are not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; l@@ atex or source code has to be compiled . the easiest way for this is to use the menu or of the button @-@ making . &quot;
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for the storage automatically .
&quot; when the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be searched in the logging for the errors . when using Quick bau should be started and oc@@ ular ; automatically , this is not the case , should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text which is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the fonts will have created a different font . the command \ \ &apos; { environment } , \ \ &apos; , and \ \ end { environment } &quot;
possible changes are only stored within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no description ( number ) for any changes in an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for enligh@@ tening the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , fats , pressures , sub@@ missions , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands may end either with the command \ \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the spa pressure and is long until he is closed with a \ \ \ \ , } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be described with \ \ &apos; h { word } . &quot;
\ \ Per@@ cent@@ age : created a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ &apos; { rate } and ends with \ \ end { Per@@ cent@@ age } .
&quot; after the background writing the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ pron@@ unciation was shown , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once the wizard has entered a bit text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quotation , a few places in the fat and spa printing and a poem to be used to see the differences in these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor using editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is a complete file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ trans@@ duc@@ er or computer screen . &quot;
for printing a &amp; DV@@ I ; file the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I can be printed ( in the viewer ) the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly adjusted ) .
&quot; tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file in other formats . as soon as the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; file text was created , the conversion into random other formats can start using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ search engine allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DV@@ I ; file .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ s . therefore , Modern under settings must be set up ... tools construction . &quot;
&quot; to try out the pre @-@ search engine , the mouse @-@ cursor is positioned in a line of source and fell asleep on pre @-@ search search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DV@@ I ; -@@ Viewer is then eff@@ ected . &quot;
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; it is used with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; therefore it must set up and on the corresponding line . this must set up &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as text editor ...

&quot; should the error use of the &amp; DV@@ I ; the viewer is not possible , an error may be available . if an error is available , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log file lists the error source in the source text . in the editor , there is always the line in which the error appears . the log file always indicates the error messages appear . in order to be clicked on the error in the log , and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once the corresponding button in tool@@ bar is clicked , a window will appear to choose the template for the document . the features presented are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a single document , a document may be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . additional information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; different users of &amp; l@@ atex ; most often use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates are made in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , you must create an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file created or create a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings may be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings in terms of settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which characters will be replaced by what variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used by entering document class . typically they will be used as : \ \ document@@ aries &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created , the following steps have been accomplished : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be handled instead of the default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one in the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; uses &amp; K@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the availability of reading and high@@ lighting by many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be made directly by &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate , and to experience his features should be brought to K@@ ate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; ki@@ le can begin there directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called by the help La@@ Te@@ X reference manual . it includes an additional description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with dr@@ on Str@@ g button to ins@@ ure the &amp; tex ; word meaning that in this way , clicking on \ \ par by \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; , merely \ \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with dr@@ on @-@ left mouse button , the text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , you can taste parts of the source file in the editing window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; to browse the various types of source texts and to note it . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many Assist@@ ants have been possible to include one &apos;s own type of book@@ marks within the text . this is also highlighted a jump to the first or last jumping marks . this jumping brand is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a sign . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; K@@ ate has been added ; important features are available in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; resource tex@@ tual ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selection , the following commands may contain the text selection : &quot;
&quot; note a complete paragraph ( group of rows that included on both sides a blank lines ) . this extended meaning is not meant to include tables , l@@ atex and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source file . the only bent thing is in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore the only bent thing separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; note the word under the current cur@@ sor@@ position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with a r@@ arity area ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a part of the document it can be removed from that first and by dr@@ on the button de@@ f . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ note r@@ zel C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides with their own commands , for a faster result . under Edit dele@@ tion , the following commands are included in the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of editing code .
&quot; it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for additional commands under Edit Sur@@ ely easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; . &quot;
this command is sc@@ anned to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the light .
with this command will pr@@ istine to the end of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to leave the area .
if the cursor in front or within the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } is placed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many inde@@ xed ambient commands , you can quickly get lost sight of this command , so the most recently established environment so that the abandoned ambient structure is not endo@@ wed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment . &quot;
with this command will sc@@ ap@@ sed to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the sof@@ tening gorge .
with this command this command is sc@@ anned at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the sw@@ add@@ ling brack@@ et .
if the cursor in front or behind the wel@@ ded gear of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located to the other end of the group j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many inter@@ cep@@ ted groups @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly the desired view . this command was most recently opened group , so that the conce@@ al structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not locked . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used two easy accum@@ ulations to be used as convenience . for the purpose of arran@@ ging the sign , the sign &apos; used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and offers two decent en@@ closure for &amp; l@@ atex ; one . &quot;
this automatic filing of double available space can set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and ex@@ its .
it is possible to use gaps @-@ specific settings ( such as n@@ german or French ) and thus German or fran@@ k spaces . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; in the case of Shift ; input button , &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent character break . if the current position inside a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables environment , smooth@@ ed &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a decent character break . &quot;
&quot; even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support advanced &amp; l@@ atex ; - or custom environments , including settings ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added . &quot;
&quot; some users like the path@@ ways in tables @-@ environments , and all the E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; trying to facilitate this . although this tab is not the one , for the depth of the table , and ki@@ le ; some intermediate space can be added to the path@@ ways position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate has already been installed in a good source code , it was installed in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) . there are three different modes for automatic processing . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under settings . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment is added by using the \ \ &apos; { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; in the middle of the bar , the last letter of the entry is removed and maintained through it . on the other hand , the list may also be res@@ ized by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are made natural by selecting a command . alternatively , jumping marks are noted , so that a simply jump to these positions can be noted by using jumping marks N@@ Ã ¶ TH@@ AT ank@@ le . &quot;
&quot; under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings for these lists can be made . there are different types of different lists available for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands , as well as wak@@ ening of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for the processing of environments not long . there are always a few letters with \ \ shall be entered and the calling for complete list mode is used . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the editing mode , the men@@ ding mode or the ke@@ ystro@@ ke Alt + Shift key space is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ &apos; { . after that , the ambient conditions can be continued through the easiest way and can be termin@@ ated by pressing the input . &quot;
&quot; once this has been accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list of lists , even a first \ \ item command are frozen . &quot;
&quot; under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings for these lists are made . this mode uses the complete list of processing mode , &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; supported by custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced with settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word perf@@ ected mode , the men@@ ue Str@@ g + Alt Room is introduced , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; gro@@ w@@ ly , for the automatic compensation are not helpful . however , a lot of wonders in a document has been written more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the distor@@ tion for all of them already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Dis@@ per@@ tain shiel@@ ds . here , the swelling can also be specified for the display of completion . &quot;
the files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / ki@@ le / usr / mode / the Persian home folder ) or tex . mode ( cold @-@ book ) or tex .
&quot; the dialogue graphics are designed , designed by graphics as easy as possible . to the extent of the foundations for the graphics formats , the sections should be sections and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . the PDF @-@ edition possible , then the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools are re@@ arranged and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to examine the results of work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed according to creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source for viewers such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the further transformation can be used in default by Alt ; 3 . after that the DV@@ I ; file is converted into a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command @-@ making fast , a spect@@ ator is called upon the comp@@ iling . should not be used in the viewer , each time will pop up a new window . &quot;
a new project is asked about the project New Project .... here the following information for the project will be asked :
&quot; in case of the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path has to be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot;
&quot; the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows to use EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed in the vertical le@@ list . &quot;
&quot; the API scripts are not yet developed , and can be found in further versions of &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
first of all it has to be said that the arran@@ ging environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a systematic object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&quot; l@@ atex ; is a fairly distinct system , in which the basic functions can be expanded through a variety of different packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; l@@ atex ; reference .
&quot; a full refer@@ n@@ z to &amp; tex ; and then , from Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â . this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for a specific form@@ atting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finishing in the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ do@@ t@@ k sent , which contained a database with all . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for par@@ c@@ els name or impact . of &amp; ki@@ le ; only the results are shown .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or using the empty space to the viewer for the document .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their involvement in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; all these tools use composite as a surface and li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt as pad . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , she knows &apos; pro@@ c and how over @-@ over it . lift it still a bit , we give it a graphical user interface ! no more on a terminal , simply clicked the icon for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application awaits a inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is adjusted in the current working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work@@ folders and enter the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous / HTML files are deleted every time when they are pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said that everybody has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y , there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; when the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select current work folders and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , their file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; then , let the current file simply be hal@@ ted . if not , delete it at current file the tick and select the file to be checked via other file - file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ protected , they just click the Well @-@ in check . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; select it &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file sel@@ ects as well as for the Relax@@ ing review , the specification of the definition @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file sel@@ ector is required . &quot;
&quot; well , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; the processing tool ! this uses the x@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the editing file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; already marked , then let the current file simply be chosen . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; type the name of the file , as the result should be named , the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; ourselves have little to do . therefore , the plug @-@ ins system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone use the wish in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be found further down . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin using the menu @-@ plug @-@ in . this means that the following dialogue is opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI . -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location site and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this path to find the plug @-@ in .
many people often work in a project of a hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens will support the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves as a unique identification .
&quot; one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project ladder . &quot;
the user may look for himself from the list of members of the team who he is . this is when he looks out the team member from the list and pus@@ hes the button as expresses . the currently selected member ( its identity ) will be f@@ ett after you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for more information on comments .
beside the overview of her team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something particular happens . see in for more information .
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be re@@ viewing the aper@@ ture and closing of the project so that later someone would be considered , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page of events of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can create events , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the recipient list . the addres@@ sat can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project ladder . see in , we@@ i such leaders are set up . &quot;
remarks are special comments in the documents . they are different from normal comments using the following things :
notes is simple . it can choose either the note entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word followed by a comment text followed by a comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the nickname and sub@@ project leaders should be led to the respective divisions or sub@@ project names , as described in the following examples below . &quot;
nickname and roller names are independent of large or small letters , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and form@@ atting , the D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be set up by means of settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages , which are treated in succession . &quot;
the behaviour of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / ell@@ ular of tags : large / small amount of tags to be used automatically . normal wholesale / small spelling means the tags are added as they are described in the days of the day XML .
large / rep@@ ell@@ ation of attributes : large / inf@@ ancy of fil@@ tered attributes . normal wholesale / small spelling means the attributes are added as they are described in the days of the day XML files .
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the bed ; added . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start and finish day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day has been altered and vice versa . &quot;
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate enco@@ ding during mounting .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the standard can be re@@ designed with the default set .
&quot; standard text enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of newly created files , or in other ways as with file opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting is eliminated from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; default D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . this setting is eliminated from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; creates regular backup copies , so that in a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for not stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edi@@ tors or in your own view ( or the documentation in a box leader ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and the source text simultaneously . &quot;
set the window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface have come through inter@@ change the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ pres@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the drop @-@ off area serves to control the possibility of switching to the display of warnings by An@@ ha@@ ken of No more .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ L and source code viewing mode . in terms of different modes , see . &quot;
&quot; here , the Par@@ ser and the Stru@@ cture can be seen in detail the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ knot@@ s in the document . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure @-@ tree , the following action is possible to change the desired action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Stru@@ cture settings the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically when editing and how deep in a change of structural tree should be opened automatically . empty knot@@ s are the empty fields in the text , while empty groups are such , where in the current document no item was found . &quot;
&quot; the area to laying down abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that are un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation somewhat different than in a group is valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of the third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the best known &amp; counter ; in the inser@@ ting of a plug @-@ ins , the following are given : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in when it is not connected to a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in in the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode load : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the loading if this option is not chosen .
&quot; check the plugin : is this activated , then stand@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ures ; whether the plug @-@ in information is correct . select also , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely new developed . as well as support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger Plugin was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; inser@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the options can be changed . &quot;
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all the holder points , with character numbers and conditions are listed . usually , in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
&quot; with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger is required , if required , or it shares the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ y requirements . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , allowing a de@@ bu@@ gger so it is not necessary to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart of Deb@@ ug@@ gen &apos;s session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the leaf to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to run a debit request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and information on the monitoring variables as well as the currently exec@@ uting line regularly . when this happens , the execution is continued before a debit request is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to send with the execution of the script , without sending information to monitored variables and the current poin@@ ter number . if this happens when a script is attached , the execution starts when a requirement is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger manages the next directive in the script without entering into the functions or includes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger manages the next directive in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes faul@@ t@@ less . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next so , as if there were the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the surplus value appears in the variation view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keit@@ h Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a K@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keit@@ h .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can adapt to your needs , and how you can help us better . &quot;
&quot; document type of Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to give support for market and scrip@@ ting languages . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the day folder and the tool@@ box . day folder are contained two file types , the &amp; the p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the final window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; D @-@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ ing . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the H@@ TE@@ P ; it includes the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ ing enable rapid integration of tags in a document without a risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day @-@ folder are nothing but a folder . they only contain the &amp; P@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and de@@ cl@@ ari@@ ed whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so other users have better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations are described in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else but nothing else . &quot;
the type of the tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt is att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day class class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a self @-@ attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
does a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a just element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only determine the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags to describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; this is a just element type element . &quot;
gives the source code used for filling the attributes in day @-@ editor and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ method inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology . the arguments that are handed to the method . may be empty or % day &apos;s name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that the elements of a list are group@@ ed together . it can only occur once a attribute . it is a purely element type element .
places the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( for example for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
provides a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a just element type .
provides a list of elements that finish a day . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration starts ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be well gre@@ ased and closed .
spaces do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; ; and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced ; but some pieces of work would disappear .
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start in the above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the review takes place only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example of a functioning family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; super@@ charge function is described . the file name of this day XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; default _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&amp; P@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is equally simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . this can di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; designed for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; P@@ TE@@ P should be created with the following entries :
&quot; &#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can set up action with settings ... created . click New action leads to the same dialogue :
this action assigned to the short@@ cut short@@ cut . with clicking the button user can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ one the current key@@ hole is remote .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the det@@ ects settings and inserted in the execution of the action this text will be added in the document to the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful shareholder type . with the help of this promotion , external applications can be started ( usually script , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) , even the quick start @-@ dialogue or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir Vari@@ able in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ Path There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when dop@@ ing to control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above methods , a script can be counter@@ posed by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; at the default entrance . in the selection box input can be determined what is sent to standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; in accordance with the entry , the output of the implemented application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the standard over@@ output ; error messages , on the standard over@@ output must be done by the value assigned to the selection box : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add actions and configure actions . select Settings action . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
&quot; fill in all the required fields , and add it to the appropriate tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes have attributes and you are planning to use their use , enable dialogue to edit &quot; tag &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size another . &quot;
&quot; note that the newly created icon does not only help you to remember what the action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day begins , I decided to create a ch@@ ap as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user , then click on this symbol ; start@@ led ; -@@ day in the current document will be em@@ itted . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press him . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; push the apply button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; functions to tool@@ bar , or it should set them for better review by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust the tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selection of the element that is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview quick access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators do support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; counter ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by adding all the symbols , to make sure everything works . &quot;
&quot; backup in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ regular folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please customize your tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened from the respective type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting , which you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; -@@ Re@@ pository , if someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will have to leave the second part we will treat you here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc le = path , relative to this file , to the document HTML files e.g. as ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ tions = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ Script 2 = 1 . 1.@@ html page 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
the tree tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example click in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so special :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc : ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Re@@ ference Start@@ ed = Edi@@ ting Start@@ ed = Edi@@ ting Start@@ ed = Edi@@ ting Start@@ ed = Edi@@ ting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ axi@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess training ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent at the top end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; resources are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be shown in the design of the context @-@ sensitive aid . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connection . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of Be@@ ist@@ rich split context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c , namely after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@
&quot; if you are sure these are good and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; -@@ Re@@ pository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; they are not alone ; they are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at various locations there is an email menu application running like D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; -@@ users can be reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and user @-@ full for publication . to make use of the resources , for which there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . therefore , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be requested after their Pas@@ p@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys . in the dialog New resource must be displayed ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the upload can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still prior to installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; in case of problems there is warning and it may then be cancelled . please note the warning message carefully . if the integrity has been given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files needed in the day XML format . there &apos;s the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started by the D@@ T@@ D menu and Con@@ vert a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder . &quot;
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string , which is available in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / W@@ 3@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; the D@@ TE@@ P according to conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; according to the conversion the &amp; P@@ TE@@ P ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand this and make full use of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; therefore , one has to get familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to give them precisely these concepts without their understanding . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; uses , available . tool@@ ing over actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . this enables the administrators to secure various tool@@ ing , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be made available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific pattern and tool@@ ing . local elements are stored in the user index so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all available from &amp; CSS ; - patterns up to tool@@ ing with special action specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tors window , the building views , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ ing . please hit , and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the cart@@ on@@ ers with the right mouse button to reset a text menu with the current document pass@@ able entries , delete , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click menu in the editor area lead to a further notice menu concerning the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edi@@ tors &quot; tool@@ box , the tool@@ ing of the editors are at present . &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as Standard , for which a set of tool@@ ing is shown . in the course of further super@@ structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the tool@@ ing shall be adapted to the new functions and , and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; using tool@@ ing is really light . if they want to insert in a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that represents the day . now , you can enter the data for this just added day . should it be a day that has several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to navigate , to open and to ro@@ am . in the presentation with Kart@@ ei@@ vers stand for files , project , sample templates , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es . this view shows all files in the project and allows the administr@@ ations of files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the text @-@ menu item . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , programme parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more about templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of outsourcing in Global , Local and Project is also functioning properly here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information on a script . on the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or to send with e @-@ mail . &quot;
this view points to the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on a element the cursor in the document is placed on the position of the element . by the right @-@ clicking of the element there is a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
&quot; this tree appears among the other components . with it , you can change attributes and names . the contents displayed on the content enables the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download the documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and reviewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , which can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this card leader shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this card leader shows all errors in the up @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; tool@@ ing are extensive , and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . chocolate side of the tool@@ box is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; send the tool@@ bar as a zi@@ pped T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; like any others secure and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es . to this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be delivered to the configure script . to understand a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path ahead of her folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , is a web @-@ development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; was optimized for a fast web development , and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions . &quot;
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; a peculiar , exten@@ dable mark@@ up language editor would make it for the absolutely greatest Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE should be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based ; thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ licted is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; allows web developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . through the program , they can now expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens . ( more about this they find in . ) &quot;
&amp; S@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for quick web development and has quickly expanded to a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is available with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help@@ desk help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ lic@@ ed Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; this list changes every time you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder , only an error is reported . &quot;
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there a special character to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ Writ@@ ing so that it is displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Writ@@ ing that the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in the URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s are used in the anchor @-@ day .
&quot; block the block selection or off , which allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key . &quot;
&quot; go directly to a number number , which is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages ! &quot;
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window to or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and switching of the problem re@@ porters at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , once you change to the structure tree . &quot;
displays the symbols left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ mark with a mouse click .
&quot; if book@@ mark book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries , or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ projects are stored with the file from .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
introduces a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. to copy graphic files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded any further input / output modules ( C@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; attitudes , such as &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , you find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in Project You / tool@@ bar and are only in this menu when you have assigned it to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens up a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that creates only the name . actions will be saved through tool@@ ing tool@@ ing tool@@ ing , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar is available at the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message using the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tools to the main server , where any other can access it . see . &quot;
download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; own description format .
&quot; download / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when the entities are to renew from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global and a writing to the global K@@ DE folder do not exist , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently available tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current day @-@ entry dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags always , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; the inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ ins menu the available plugins are listed below the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on it . click on the plug @-@ in plug @-@ ins off .
sel@@ ects the syn@@ axi@@ al code mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting sp@@ ata depends on the stock version ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of inser@@ tion identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application tidy .
&quot; immediate switch between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes take time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a selection , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
notes the display of the status bar at the bottom of the pass ; main window and off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application , which use the C@@ HTML part , including the &amp; con@@ par@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
controls the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which can add or change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should produce a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but like with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out best from top to bottom , e.g. after filling out the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be set up later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ Project file . by default it has the name of the project in small case and without space with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine that you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ name e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
lets this field empty , the default settings of the selected log output will be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote computer it could be an adjustment needed . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should rather be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ ing tools are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by standard tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should instead be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
&quot; this attitude is great if you have static web content , which you want to download and change . when using scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be integrated . if a project is started anew , not ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders displayed within the main board will be displayed and you can make a precise selection of di@@ lution . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through An@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the bun@@ ches , out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload files in the menu with project attributes in the sub@@ window profile or with the keyboard Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings meet those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are re@@ printed in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; supple@@ mental option to top , also files , which are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded with opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin can be set with the button . in this de@@ bug is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profile files can be set up up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a component view for the content of the server for each profile , dra@@ fting a separate building view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can change event actions and add these actions to change or delete them . event actions will run if a previous event occurs , like the Si@@ ght of a file . see into the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the last project that was opened . however , this behavior cannot be influenced right now . &quot;
to open a different project select project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ elop@@ es ; changed files . the same happens when you download a new project . &quot;
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing open and open with ... in the context of the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only longer a profile is present , the button is trun@@ cated in order to prevent removing . &quot;
&quot; the password will keep in core memory and be forgotten in programs . this possibility is useful when most frequent up@@ loading files is needed , and the rather uns@@ afe password on the record will not save the option . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you want to change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , many high @-@ profile profiles can be up@@ loaded and thereby re@@ charged the project ( or part of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files will be copied . either a fully @-@ qualified domain name or IP address work . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the installed version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; select file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not manage a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your shaft threshold this is either a time @-@ saving feature or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming language can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ box . in a project there can be many views , i.e. , by simply exchange views , diverse files and tool@@ ing can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; with whom to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y ; to their own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ ing in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; best about the menu tool@@ ing . use and add can be distinguished . adding tool can be treated in the section of adding tool .
&quot; the tool@@ ing and the symbols can either be set using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool@@ bar can remove , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialogue , where actions can be visible on these or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , you will also remove the entries promotion and display promotion , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ ing and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool and set up promotions .. set up actions .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ets , code cut@@ lets and files to link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lan . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any at the system &apos;s existing directory in the pre @-@ work@@ tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; into about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions presented at the start of each template before using exactly .
&quot; bin@@ ar is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be used any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ar ) . some examples are usually included in documents using worldwide templates . more information about the templates are available in . &quot;
documents can be compiled by any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally more special rum@@ ors for the purpose and organized the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found under global templates . see in for more information about the templates .
&quot; this kind of templates is useful when not a new document is to be inserted on a template , but the same text area is always included in documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system based on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see in for more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; as its name says , these Templ@@ ates for whole Web sites serve as templates . they are a collection of different documents organised in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template store as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project base ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the pre @-@ tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on File to save a selection as a local / project position . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged down to the building management templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a template folder , so it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and inser@@ ting via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder tree or in the project files to select a folder on the right and secure Site submission . by default , it is backed by the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very expe@@ dient procedure . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , some things can fit in the eye with the use of templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in the sub@@ window and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates
&quot; to specify the behaviour of a folder , right click the folder with the right mouse button and in the context menu tab . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is trun@@ cated as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and fits everything except the stem cells . if a regular folder would be so set , it would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , b@@ lah would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , one probably is in a regular folder . &quot;
permitted or illustrated text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines respectively foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er a complete presentation with the most suitable head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
&quot; in addition , you have a text menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) of a complete instruction collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which is accessible via the menu . the first mode will be replacing the source text editor into two parts : the source text Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML , page , and a cursor . then you can edit and switch when needed to source code Editor , in which the changes made in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will be visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , continues to change the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that simultaneously the changes are visible in source text editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously running . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key@@ press puts the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document will be maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization link between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable to settings Qu@@ anta . in addition , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set in addition to the tim@@ esp@@ ace . basically , the recommendation is set : a small span@@ dex for fast machine and a large cl@@ utter for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties . this means the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this editor lets you change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click on the list allows the modification of the content , e.g. keywords in the column names and keywords key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing the reading of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete . change about the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template , pressing the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sors is as used in a text processing , by using the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted through ing@@ typ@@ ing and can be deleted using the taste or removal . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way on tool@@ making , as in the source text editor , it is important to note that tags before already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. when an anchor @-@ day , is enclosed with text , everyone must be removed from the anchor @-@ day . &quot;

&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style templates . in contrast to other programs for style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styles can be pro@@ secuted . &quot;

&quot; there are many graphical tools for comparisons . why so , &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; ? let me tell me briefly why I wrote . &quot;
the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had altered a lot of text in the same file . the result has been numerous conflicts in the result .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed inside these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where maybe only the over@@ re had changed . that change was a small nightmare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences in a row and changes to white signs . later many more useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you would like to compare text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge from folders . this function was transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way conver@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two people can work independently of each other on one piece of co@@ de and make changes . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files together at the same time :
&amp; Issu@@ e 3 ; also helps you with the comparisons and merge @-@ complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; perform in the folder :
&quot; &amp; Issu@@ e 3 ; displays the exact differences and includes the possibilities of today monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and sp@@ ul@@ ators are clearly displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can look at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side of the column . ( no hassle any more if someone changes the oppression . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color shows , which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but in different folders , you can make yourself the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file completely . example : &quot;
Super@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 2 -@@ o Target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ ner@@
&quot; opening @-@ dialog enables the manual type of file name , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or the selection of a last opened file from the file list . you do not have to specify the third file ; if you do not need to leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences is done with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge from folders . if for A file is selected , for B and C there is a folder , then used &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if the input field is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can start this step later when saving . &quot;
the set button opens up a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the comparisons .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . it allows you to choose text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison will then start . in opening @-@ dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and use drag , simply drag a file from a file name or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only need to create two appropriate files , they would be in &amp; diff@@ usion 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections just copy , paste and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot draw anything out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text in a comparison window will be supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag and dra@@ gging text into another program than cutting , inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the number number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) An@@ de info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse display a while above the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three he@@ aders are assigned the letters A , B and C . a color blue color , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , you can see on the color , which file differs in red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( summ@@ arized ) . &quot;
&quot; left beside the text there is the attached column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in character chains and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line which separates the clas@@ hes column from the text is interrupted , where the respective source file has no lines . if the cursor is enabled , the line will be displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison window ) also has a info line with the ins@@ cription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; texture &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains the automatic comp@@ ose of text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! till all conflicts are dissolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next sol@@ vent / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed where the beginning of the group is not visible . ) This group will then be highlighted the current group . it will appear with the color background color for the current area and on the left appears a black beam .
&quot; sometimes , by auto mer@@ ging or through manual editing , no more line remains in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt is displayed ; one line is shown in the file ; one line does not appear in the final recorded file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and paste it elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; quotes ; however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources modify the options , ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating primarily with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons , right , end , end , tr@@ l @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , Si@@ v as you can also use it from other programs . the excess bar next to the vertical image bar can be used also to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to manipulate . with the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and re@@ writ@@ able mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the Com@@ prehen@@ sive Colum@@ ns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the section called the edi@@ table window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous / last difference , for the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , at the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) . therefore , between the solved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ ting ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you highlight , automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual coupling de@@ tract . be careful with this option but you might be accidentally over@@ written the content of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; hands @-@ end will be stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a poin@@ ter sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use car @-@ run files \ \ \ \ . K@@ ace 3 retains the poin@@ line of source files not , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; neither with bin@@ aries files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when the program starts and restored at the next start . ( select Settings - &gt; K@@ .@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences will be displayed in short writing . if the selected font does not support this representation , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button button automatically represents an un@@ just colour . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the pressing of the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of whit@@ esp@@ ace . otherwise , a tab is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you enter entering or return , the re @-@ going of the line will automatically be used for the next row . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which box type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual choice on the used operating system .
&quot; at the same time , it tries to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compares every line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . however , white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car squ@@ ad &apos; \ \ &apos; and a poin@@ ter sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again save only one character set , however , as a white character are treated . while this option is enabled , this option must be disabled . if this option is disabled , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; the default option is disabled . in the first part of analysis , figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and big files but slowly with very large files .
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ jump mode , this setting will determine how long the result of selecting is shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters used by selecting the selected file as a source . ( pre@@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the options to ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter for scanning folders and perform a compilation . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and meeting .
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is removed the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ l . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ ce , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adap@@ ts the language of user interface . the changing of this option does not affect the current current program . you must finish and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; C diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is globally set across the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries will be used for the top setting . &quot;
&quot; above the selection fields for the code appears a short notice , which is the local co@@ ding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . since the enco@@ ding for each file is adjustable individually , even files can be compared and merged with different co@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; when you have edited a file , you can specify how enco@@ ding to be saved . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code ) but the pre @-@ processing command can only be set up with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn this to high@@ lighting pur@@ port@@ ations of changes in white characters in the text or review split . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . depending on the choice of A &amp; lt ; C , A &amp; B ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; C , besides the normal , a second excess column is shown with the required information . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , one would rather like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; type the comparison window next to each other , or each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the compositions and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ defined name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the file , then the name of the last files used is maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it will first pass it to this external order . in &amp; box diff@@ use it , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preference processor that will exactly meet your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the deposit . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external order ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when entering this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own preference processor that will meet your own preferences . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind this is to facilitate the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are perfectly suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into big letters : sed &apos;@@ s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; CV@@ S and other version control systems are using a number of keywords used to automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . now , a pre @-@ processing command for foref@@ athers \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed experiment , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers actually is an already built @-@ in function in K@@ ace 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for foref@@ athers more suitable . sed &apos;s / / 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to carry out multiple requirements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;@@ s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Get / switches &quot; &quot; However , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the specified &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data according to normal pre @-@ processor is maintained for the display and for the display . further operations only change the data , which sees the poin@@ line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the poin@@ line dis@@ processor sees the output of normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but like in any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in one folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for every object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can comp@@ simul@@ ate this and shows the simul@@ ated changes without making them really doing
... &quot; perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
&quot; this is similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files very similar . you only need to enter folder on the command line , or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder was specified , it may be used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge this together . to start the merge , you must press the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder , you will inform a little news window regarding current progress . if you cancel scanning the folder , only the files listed until then were compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder that was found during scan , is shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click or click the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories and add to all sub@@ directories with which you can capture and add all the directories .
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file will start the same file and it appears as a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the different folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the activation code can not be selected automatically . if that is run together , you will be informed about the problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the color is also identical , although the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered to be identical if their total content is identical . then , the folder also have the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow gets and later if it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized , then the option directories are chosen , so that both files are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge together and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly according to the composite file only B ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged , and the option to select the new file instead of comp@@ utation ( in@@ secure ) , then examine &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not removed , this cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the assemb@@ ling , one file after the other is processed . it &apos;s status column shows you when the assemb@@ ling was successful , and according to other messages when something un@@ expect@@ edly entered . if this is completed , you should make a last review and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the interior dialog chosen the file @-@ method of full analysis , K@@ cer@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ vent , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be shown when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the straight selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries are selected at once . if you selected all the sessions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) you can bring together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode C is used as a target , as the two @-@ folder , B will be chosen as a target and sync , A and / or B as a destination will be used . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to add all entries together : select fil@@ esystem / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) : choose action of the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting file types still exist , there appears a message that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then choose a valid action . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will pop up with the options through , simul@@ ate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
only if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; Issu@@ e 3 ; then results in certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( assembled a single file ) , then the screen opens up ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , choose again directory assembled / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved , appears a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages which will help you to choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to choose another action for the entry or prevent the problem in another way before you go together . &quot;
&quot; if some items have been compiled individually , please refer to &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and then leads them later , these entries are not saved as being done . only if you change the assemb@@ ling action , these entries will be re@@ merged . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ ace 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ compilation with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the sub@@ tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid ticket holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default file must not match these patterns .
files and folders that correspond to the pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; only divi@@ ders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ ce ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to the pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; only divi@@ ders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ ce ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files will be ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set up with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a distor@@ tion attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems it marks a well @-@ called Punk@@ t. a file as hidden . this option makes you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on to default .
&quot; if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; with links to the folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links such as normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively . a link to a folder containing a link on yourself would result to a End@@ less sli@@ ps and &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; cras@@ hes . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; perform a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ ves , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that does not contain text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders about a slow network , it may possibly be faster , just the chan@@ ges@@ tion date and file size . however , this speed of speed will cost you a certain level of security . please note with caution . this option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; much like confidential to the chan@@ ges@@ tion date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical , e.g. useful when copying the chan@@ ges@@ tion date . please note with caution . this option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the sync mode , when two folders are compared and no target folder specified . in this mode , the proposals are to be specified . also the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered unsure as the other file is not also changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder will be replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed it and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ ine extension that already exists , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge of individual files , not just that merge the whole folder . this option is switched on to default . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder @-@ together view stays visible in the assemb@@ ling single files ; you can move the window @-@ divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the window directory &amp; text window to switch the window window in the window menu and switch between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file just by double @-@ click . nevertheless , there is a single file together via double @-@ click menu . as soon as you save the result , the file is set up and the file will not be assembled once you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status goes lost if you read the directory again : folder menu : new read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network of transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ ace 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compares a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compares a folder in a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
special characters need to be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank ) &gt; % 20 , etc . for example has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes due to the protocol used . it follows a brief list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( please note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always starts the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ ace 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ ace 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a Part 3 ; then , &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch @-@ file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ ace 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work when none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , when the original files have changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that merge or perform the same from folders in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ ace 2 ( well , He@@ ist &apos;s comp@@ are ) are already available . besides , the name K@@ de@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL @-@ programs very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go through it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and will probably not be communicated the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the pres@@ et@@ setting , configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical as not identical . IF @-@ lines of the next to each other , this is accurate , this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . however , this important information is needed to create a conflict simply by clicking into the source text and selecting the button &apos; A / B / C . however , this important information is simply saved as text file and it is much effort to design extra a separate file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort has so far been too big . you can recover a particular version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used for another editor .
after removing text suddenly is lt ; no sr@@ c swe@@ eps ; appeared and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&quot; &amp; C diff@@ use , already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
&quot; to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use , need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
&quot; information on how you can use K@@ DE 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please refer to the homepage . &quot;
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
&quot; to compile &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; C diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir is available to the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have any problems with the comp@@ iling . should you encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
cut out ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt removal ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current position position or replaces the current mark@@ er .
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all folders , does not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version of the program , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the function update after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are shown to display the differences . this also causes identical files to merge in the target folder . if the target folders such files does not already contain , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from source with cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button below . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ ature of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the working areas , change their size , or shift it . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and end . if however , on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the icon will appear to appear as well as the name of the application as well as the items to minimize , maxim@@ ise , To work space and finish . the commands bring : &quot;
maxim@@ izing the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
sends the application for the selected virtual desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; is this cross @-@ field marked , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , you will be shown in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ space is shown . &quot;
&quot; crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ space are displayed . it is shown together with name , the names will be shown with folders , and eg . 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field crosses , the ongoing programs are shown as small windows on the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working areas are shown to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ camp ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n R@@ aster , like P@@ ager applications appear in some other Windo@@ w@@ man@@ tras ; wa@@ agre@@ cht shows all virtual workplaces in a horizontal row , which is suitable very well for the representation of side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control panel . he has the advantage that it will change in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with their content and move it . besides , it runs outside the control panel . &quot;
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch switches to set ... allows the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ propaganda c using any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I.

&quot; it may be a scre@@ enshot and you can use it ; a part of the screen you can use ; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; may ; &quot;
&amp; likes ; is a very powerful application that is continually expanded by new features . it is optimized for use on powerful machines .
&quot; when you see &amp; may ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen . in the following , this window will appear as the larger window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , it may be extended &amp; k@@ ingly ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a movable lo@@ upe . alternatively you can cause a selected screen area in the screen window ( selection window ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor at the screen ( eg , at the left screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window will be displayed , select the mouse cursor . please note that this &amp; may not be able to recognize the form of mouse cursor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the larger window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fier and post@@ p@@ one it . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press &amp; Shift ; button press or the M@@ MB , you can move the window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . remember that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window remains firm and only the lower right @-@ hand corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to enter into a file in the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stop updating the display . St@@ opp@@ en the update ensures that the required CPU time against 0 goes .
&quot; select the Update Det@@ ector ( Very low , low , medium , ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; it automatically uses your built @-@ made du@@ t command to save files , opening a new window , prints , no@@ vices ( with the button document re@@ charge in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlargement , and con@@ jun@@ c@@ ents &amp; etc . &quot;
it may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a scre@@ enshot . you can use a micro@@ scope to view the screen printed in a newspaper or photograph . this application is for various people of use : from research or artist to Web@@ designer or visual impair@@ ments .

&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor up a while at the same place exp@@ elled . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ ray syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click pains prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor takes a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ ins In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer pain that are related to your computer if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify things even though : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain helps to arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the use of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic equipment : the result can be different for each . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ pool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitoring your mouse movements and carries a mouse @-@ click , once you break the movement short . &quot;
&quot; if the smart grid is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; a break after it is pushing the mouse button . now , you are moving up until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse is executed . in this way , you can run the pulling with holding mouse button . the smart grid requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it . &quot;
&quot; this so@@ aking time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; one click away . &quot;
&quot; is intelligent reloc@@ ated , the turn@@ out time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ pool ; after the shut@@ down is waiting until it leaves the mouse button again if there is no need for the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ pool ; now supports the click of the mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow move left and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow button saved after left and back takes a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; the first time started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten up the reaction times ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ ders sound bu@@ ffer , which you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers . &quot;
&quot; is this setting marked , becomes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tee ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; running . this feature is currently only available on &amp; k@@ de . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please make the relevant documentation at the rate to find out how you start playing a program . &quot;
&quot; if all settings returns to the values that have been opening at opening the dialogue , you have already pushed the button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last set@@ back . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ pool ; first with preference . in particular , the smart grid should let you first switched off . if you then hit the automatic mouse click , you can later get the smart p@@ anning . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; decrease in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without impact stays : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on locations in the browser window , which does not link any link , but you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse rests , you ought to clean your mouse . that is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , from mouse to mouse it is different . however , it should be quick to see if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling lets you easily merge with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system collap@@ ses the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; if you just started moving it , it means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation is no longer able to stop by letting the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; put under a different window manager and move a window . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can carry out a single mouse click . thereby , the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual . &quot;
problem : if you enter text box tries &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; continue to edit mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to the cursor , where you want to have it . however , leave the mouse on a neutral field of desktop if you want to create a ke@@ ystro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor and eg . the gray areas around the tool@@ box and menus and the front headlines from windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart grid , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
the smart grid is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to re @-@ paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board . here are some advice to them :
&quot; use the smart grid not even if you just begin using &amp; cr@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; to use the text instead , follow the mouse button down , while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text , and click on the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , every@@ time when &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tee ; the mouse presses a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the smart p@@ adding even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for this , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ter ; to use , the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow , must be installed . this should already be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and it is set up to date .
&quot; &amp; col@@ mou@@ set@@ pool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is short . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome , and which the actu@@ ation of the keys are sor@@ cer@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ pool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling process , before the mouse button is released . in this way , the dra@@ gging and dra@@ fting can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the mu@@ te user to let their computers speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , the user can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose from a list with the call of sentences , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the speech edition of text . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , you can choose the default text box . from the text pass@@ able text@@ books you can often use the text passages , without having to type in . the text passages may be processed . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen ) , you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ding machine . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can select the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words entered into the Wor@@ ds . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a circul@@ atory memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; correct , you can enter the propositions in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select from it , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page of Wor@@ th@@ rot@@ or as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the box of the card box , enter the command to call the language generators . in the selection field below the input field you specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the cross @-@ field , if the text is unchanged as default messages to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field is not selected , the text will be shared as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to language over@@ output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , determine which action through the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text box password or in the box for text pass@@ able books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ cks , the chosen text will be directly spoken and inserted in the cache memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text will only be entered in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing plate for text pass@@ able book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ able book can be automatically saved to the closing of the service window . &quot;
&quot; by selecting text pass@@ agen@@ ic book , the book is saved . if you choose any changes , the text pass@@ able book will not be saved . choose Sub@@ scri@@ ption , ask if the text pass@@ able book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page Th@@ es@@ per@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . in this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right hand , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries to change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads as a result . the frequency of individual words will simply be determined by en@@ umer@@ ation of occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to just add correctly the words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can comp@@ ose the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how this wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; using this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered into the dictionary automatically create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ able books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text pass@@ able books are shown as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key@@ hole . if you have chosen a text box , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books , or you can delete selected text pass@@ ages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text messages or text passages , you can change through drag with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text cut is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text @-@ table is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the currently active phrase is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the store . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is indicated , a movable tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by mouse click on the refined left side and dra@@ gging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; when this menu entry is indicated , a narrow leather is shown in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not indicated , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is indicated , a shifting bar box for text pass@@ able books is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the refined left side and dra@@ gging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably , you do not have entered the command for the speech of speech right or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the cardboard card . ( see Settings dialog for language profi@@ ci@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . the license allows it to use the festival free of charge without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice @-@ over@@ s , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a Java @-@ free language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . currently , the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the language over@@ s , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . language edition is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default output . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it transforms a list of ph@@ on@@ gs in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to de@@ generate the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to transform the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to send the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate as in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ file / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option Data must be switched on as default .
&quot; the speech of voice @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service , which is available for voice @-@ over@@ s . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language over@@ s systems . &quot;
&quot; as the setting of language generators is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you will need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setting up the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to make use of &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on both your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can not speak to spend text by the machine . it will be saved a list of previously mentioned phrases , which the user can again release again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language @-@ izer will be included . on the machine a language @-@ izer must be installed .

various speakers for the same synthes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with multiple printing solutions for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card &apos;s card speaker in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s , the card speakers will be displayed automatically . it will then automatically start when you start col@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all the already furnished speaker appear in this list . the prefer@@ ential speakers appear above in the list . the first speaker is used for the speech issue if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; select one mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select one mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select one mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ;
&quot; choose a vocal type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and maid agree to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker appears on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the cardboard card General and check if the T@@ TS @-@ Service from &amp; k@@ de ; now , you can use it , click on the cardboard card orders to create text orders . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card &apos;s card holder to open this card ticket . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ field to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start successfully , the cardboard card orders will be displayed and you can create text entries and read . see . remove the mark@@ er , the K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the T@@ TS @-@ system of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s is completed , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; on , long as the field of language over@@ s enable ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; is this cross @-@ field marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s appears when reading automatically in the system area of the control panel , disappears again as soon as the pre@@ read is complete . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons in this series you can start text entries , stop , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker to a job . &quot;
&quot; click OK or OK , then all changed settings on all sides will be taken over . &quot;
&quot; the card orders is only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card in card and activate ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; contem@@ pl@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; col@@ de ; then you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check out the text you want to read and choose in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the speech edition should begin . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , and other invisible brands are also read as well . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; then you can pre @-@ read text . check out the text , which is to be read and select in the main menu Tools text . then , the language over@@ s should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg , in &amp; kon@@ anta ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; col@@ de , which will notify you of the events specified by you . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; to the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up various types of messages if you are notified when in a IR@@ C channel a message appears in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C communication text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry of messages in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for string construction provide a good opportunity to correct &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or incorrect news to correct . the tags br and b from the news , sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filtering text is dealt with , before it is sent to speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unciation , to select wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain shortcomings of language . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispute &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; screen readers have the highest priority . it will be dra@@ gged down to all other orders , and holding these orders . if the screen readers are read , the requested orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming very hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
&quot; news have the next top priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . whilst you want to read a long text on a website , you can welcome back to the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each order , which you encounter on the cart@@ on card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that have text messages . text agreements are intended for output for longer texts , which have no particular urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen controller , while it reads this issue , this issue will be stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to regular warnings , messages and text agreements , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; news . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are performed as modules . in the future it can still be further types of filters .
string strings replace parts of a text by other text . the inser@@ ting parts can either give you as words or as regular expressions . it is made using text or for the re@@ format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) um &amp; XML ; from a format converting to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can be read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech issue . if the filter determines that its rules do not exist , the text remains unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; sent on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters takes place in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of furnished normal filters . if a filter is not attached , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be used up from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; if you type a list of words or regular expressions , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparisons . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the associated replacement text . large and small spelling is not observed in comparison . &quot;
&quot; type your filter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , just choose from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compares the text with the string chains in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is displayed in the order shown above down@@ wards .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter is only applied if the narr@@ ator says one of the languages described here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l . button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value included , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; and the &amp; D@@ Bus ; number , you need to we@@ gl@@ are . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ability ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only copy head@@ set . &quot;
&quot; the string @-@ disk filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions are applied with an entry in the box type . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
in comparison of words the string @-@ pedi@@ gree filters are used in the shape \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) .
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; apply in the package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ formation . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the aid program x@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the ambient variable path , it also extends x@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; you can send text messages to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can choose for example that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , there is a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is chosen according to the speaker properties which the program proposes to write the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; with the speaker filter you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value included , the filter is applied , if the text contains the regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expression installed , you can access this with a click on the button to get help in the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression on the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you determine the characteristics of the specified settings specified here . if the text comp@@ lies with the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is chosen to display the desired requirements on the right . click on the right button to display the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or to delete all settings .
the spre@@ ader filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box type . you need to enter at least one condition .
&quot; the VO API , from &amp; k@@ de ; to give the programmers to give their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module , with the language @-@ izer to be added to the TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ output API of &amp; k@@ de . you can find full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the site ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications ask for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text for reading and option a language code like &amp; eg , en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , please type : &quot;
&quot; open two &amp; con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start off in a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s in the other . &quot;
none of the above language drivers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; - trans@@ former@@ filter installed , but when using the module for festival sites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you will need to do that if you do not use this voice to read pages read pages and use the ambient variable path . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause errors in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences is printed or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the Option @-@ enco@@ ding is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be resolved through a string of string . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; speech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice @-@ speaking . if you want to extend it ; for the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; re@@ conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; do you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or new ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text of &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded from the spring @-@ text archive , or downloaded for any night currently created Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language . therefore , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed , that the establishment of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ semb@@ led in individual sentences . the user can return pro@@ posi@@ tional , or ab@@ stain @-@ programs , repeat the issue or ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; if an application text is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts , it may request the properties of the prefer@@ ential intercom for the output . thus , an application may request a female English speaker . if you want to learn a spokes@@ man whose language is English and its gender . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ man will choose , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card spokes@@ man on Add , and then insert a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the card card speaker is shown . for example , the set up of the module for festival Interactive will be shown . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable program . when the path to Festival is included in path , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text enco@@ ding for text which are handed over to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; generally , this setting will be made automatically . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ der we put volume , microphone speed and pitch in the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and appear this grey , the voice you select cannot be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some votes such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size several seconds , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with a large storage power ) the first set is syn@@ ced faster . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ section cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t yet set up a speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box is marked , the program window is displayed in the program window . otherwise , after starting only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; is this cross @-@ field marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s is not running , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . therefore , you have the opportunity to read or otherwise control the text . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application , which has submitted the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can pre @-@ pass on the order , which is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s are reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this symbol to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the cardboard card . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text entries are listed and managed . expenses of screen readers , warnings and messages are not shown . further information on the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio @-@ over@@ s . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled , and kt@@ ts ; either without support for the respective audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or kt@@ ts ; may not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have selected Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; set the microphone speed here one . 50@@ nbsp ; % matches about half and 200@@ M ; % about double normal speech speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; to take over the system .
the list of Al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules which are decorated in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device is working with you . in doubt select standard .
&quot; on this card card , you can set specific actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; screen readers have the highest priority . it will be dra@@ gged down to all other orders , and holding these orders . after the issuing of the screen reader has been read , the requested orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have priority the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg . processor becomes hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . this orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you read &amp; win ; just a long text on a website , you can welcome up with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; will be interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen controller , insert &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ edition into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played off when a normal word contract is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory news are active , the introductory sound is played in front of the introductory news . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card will only apply to normal text agreements . for news , warnings and spending of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders there are no special promotions , if this is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages posted , run k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and click on noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ field to turn the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; directions to turn off . if this option is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and t@@ ect@@ ory ; read no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; is this setting marked , noti@@ fications , with which a sound is performed , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or remove it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog appears in which you want to select the application and the event that you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation , when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this selection field to establish what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following selection options :
&quot; when you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired microphone . standard select the speaker , which is displayed on the list on the card speakers as the top item . &quot;
note that there are three levels of events . if a particular application is specified for events . otherwise the action for any other events is executed . otherwise the action is specified for any other events of the particular application . as the last option comes the action to fru@@ ition which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this reason you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button save to save the settings for noti@@ fications into a file . use the button loading , stored stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Dele@@ te . all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a speech issue . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , the speaker speed , the volume , the sex of voice and pitch . moreover , trademarks for controlling the pron@@ unciation for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ ph@@ onic voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML issue . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or key in the Festival configuration dialog is not on 100@@ M ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; / speech / speech / speech / speech . who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter ) . SB@@ Ds divide text in individual sentences . this can begin to read or stop the first set , even if the language does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is automatically set up by a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ w@@ elling filters , but beginners will fall away from it . &quot;
&quot; to get the easiest way to learn the setup selection procedure . place the speaker selection and select text for reading . check the card selection again , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose the speaker menu again , change some properties and check how to have set up the selection procedure . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then you can start reading more quickly , as only the first set is to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you may stop or cancel text messages on the cart@@ on card , even if the language is not supported by this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is automatically set up when you start col@@ tt@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it cannot be dis@@ connected , just removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression of typ@@ ing and insert a tab sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( dec@@ imal characters ) are automatically removed from the text . notice that the default pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter filter is made .
&quot; SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( cold ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen repression . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from understanding the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter filter , you can insert it again by using the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in sheets . &quot;
on the cardboard box you can cover the inter@@ locking settings for the application . the card card is shown if
use of the standard driver ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; using the appropriate speaker , which displays all the characteristics of a furnished microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is closest to the original properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired amount properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired microphone . if this property does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
highlight this cross @-@ field if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set up multiple markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field spokes@@ man , which is closest to the tip , click on the selection button and then use it for speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 for the last written contract is in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) . &quot;

&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is cras@@ hed and t@@ ect@@ ory ; probably , you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not resolved this is a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install G@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio edition of Al@@ sa does not work when I miss simultaneously with another application music . if I get a text message , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message that states : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system the problem is that conflicts occur at al@@ sa , preventing a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . clu@@ es for possible solutions can be found on the site of the Al@@ sa @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Run@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded one additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s does not show this voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ st@@ int . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the cardboard card , there is a setting speed . that this works , the program is so@@ x installed and can be switched on the environment variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers module like Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; ( see ) or , if you are completely brave , change the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML de@@ former@@ 5 , and set the microphone speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it read that web pages are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . this festival makes no mistakes , thro@@ ws the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber Kabel . the same goes for VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts in the audio @-@ over@@ s . if your system also counts , you can not play music while reading a text and then you can start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with booth July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; stop , the current set is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of the microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install un@@ x using the command apt @-@ get install un@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already . &quot;

&quot; the following modules for language profi@@ ci@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a run@@ time dependence on non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) , the configure parameter shows the configure parameters that causes the move of the screen . &quot;
&quot; the default file is specified as default ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you will need to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check if your language is working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , microphone speed and pitch height with &amp; kt@@ ts ; &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help to get in the instructions that are supplied with festival . do you want to read web pages read , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you will have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing . &quot;
this voice sets for 1.@@ 95 beta or new ones . the voice is still in early stage development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / ad@@ ored / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices you have to enter for the voices of ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux . search festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ i as for example CO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then , the festival takes the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio @-@ over@@ s . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; cart@@ on center ; enabling the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNA settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings for a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu boxes ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be shown ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; will be started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need already have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of network features . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; installed and furnished . network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded via adaptation of the following files , according to the core version , are loaded : &quot;
the module network settings is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected is selected . when starting the module network settings this system is trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the wide choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and rel@@ eas@@ ants will best meet . by flag@@ ging the setting no @-@ again questions , the definition can be met permanently . at the next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically adjusted . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are grey , which means the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you enter the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
in the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . these are divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed :
&quot; the settings of network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button &quot; button . &quot; in dialogue , it can be set up . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button @-@ Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system sends the TCP / IP @-@ information at any system start , so there is no further adjustment required . in the selective list may be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with the boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values contained in this dialog are shown as qualities of the device in the tool@@ box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices may be activated or activated depending on your needs . turn on an un@@ folded network system by selecting from the list and click of interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices may be activated or dis@@ integrated according to your needs . switch off a activated network system by selecting from the list and click of interface .... &quot;
&quot; sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ network , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is currently used for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if at the computer there is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only use IP addresses . if the computer is required only IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS triggers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the calcul@@ ating connection is a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered through selection of a selection and exec@@ uting or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons , or put them into priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; &quot; from group calcul@@ ator to the attri@@ bution can be added to a DNS server . it will add the dialog of New Nam@@ server . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click on adding the button . then , the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator , select an item and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list specifically known calcul@@ ator describes calcul@@ ator &apos;s name @-@ on @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at boot , if no DNS server can be available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains some known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still being included in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click Add .... The dialog Neue Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click on adding the button . if the well @-@ known computer has multiple ali@@ ases , de button Add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a specifically known calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The dialog trusted machine is displayed .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable changes , the following command must be removed . &quot;
&quot; the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf : is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source . &quot;
&quot; for installation of binary distribution ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) it ranges , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
&quot; installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package , and in a single console ; with r@@ pm as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surfaces such as c@@ package or installation tool . &quot;
&quot; in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient for this case , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ glasses ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second part , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace more knowledge about IP @-@ networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the inclusion of the PCs is stored in a small ( home @-@ fit ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to focus in the near future . this description is therefore currently focused on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator which is available for a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . definitely the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when placing your own small ( home ) network , the IP @-@ address should be selected from a specially chosen field to avoid IP addres@@ s@@ lic@@ ates with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet , so their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made by hi@@ ring a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks generally addresses are used in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the machines are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg . .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the two @-@ the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP re@@ directing . &quot;
&quot; the AC address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files , that are of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ men , are affected and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file sometimes changes dynam@@ ically to DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is to be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected may happen . &quot;

&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pro@@ vision@@ ing , searches it according to the right index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changed for the band@@ age to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through out of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the belt , first of all , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : by changing the symbol for the tape , the inclusion of the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger . &quot;
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used it must form@@ at@@ ted from &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
&quot; a band types need to form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not require the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not need to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted drives , however , do not work any form@@ atting of the belt , DAT drives however . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completing the form@@ atting process , the tape is automatically integrated and used . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you will need to select the required files . this can be done in three types : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are protected .
&quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured . &quot;
right click on the local file tree and select in the Si@@ ght menu ...
once the backup began to secure the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a bun@@ ches . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item in the menu .
&quot; once the inspection process has been started , the dialog settings appears for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ station for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialogue will be notified . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the restore , the files that should be recovered , marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives files , which include entry for the belt drive . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored . &quot;
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select to restore the menu .
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialogue settings for restoration work . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ station for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data through@@ put , and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file according to the tape @-@ content . this procedure covers all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape : &quot;
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
&quot; the current level of work , in which the backup should be done . the list of written files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , is that only the files stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can register separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
&quot; del@@ etes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up , and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup . &quot;
the functionality of the buttons are written ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device work for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ fine version of the band@@ device .
&quot; if this option is actively conve@@ yed , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the strap is inserted the load to drive to the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the throw from the band@@ age . possibly this setting does not work with all band@@ age drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when solving &amp; k@@ dat files ; automatically the tape is ej@@ ected . use this option not to flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ wide block size for the belt drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you must communicate it &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drive should be disclosed . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only be a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , where calcul@@ ator is the full name of the system , on which the strap was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which have since the time passed , in which the band form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar @-@ archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup job . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; S@@ systemic log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; spect@@ ator for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system enables quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; S@@ systemic log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ systemic log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system does the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ systemic log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be fil@@ tered and evaluated with their help the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features . this includes :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with the help to filter the single protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort . the individual ways to sor@@ ting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start is tried &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocols - to open . will not be shown with system administr@@ ations . the protocol files usually are usually found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually not need permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected criterion set off . in the default setting , the selection box contains beside the filter the entry all . then a log line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search file is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . select the string of the filter search file , then select the column process , and enter the fil@@ ter@@ bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines , which have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the stage errors are shown with a show@@ y color as protocol lines of the level indication . the colored presentation of protocol lines can be switched off dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new additions to the record lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; S@@ system@@ log ; allows to display several protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows and manage . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; S@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further current information on the sources of &amp; k@@ systemic log ; .
&amp; S@@ systemic log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section guides a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program start at the high @-@ speed of the system in the &amp; Linux world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( among others I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ install and re@@ format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start up@@ lifting the system or when changing to another Run@@ level . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ ters that only once started . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ d should lie on the one hand , under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ de@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run some of what has to do with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see one line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably find that the pres@@ et @-@ in run@@ down 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can restore / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have something per@@ vert , then you come up by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how starts and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written , that it is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains , the script will start with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; win ; a server @-@ Run@@ level lets you run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running out . furthermore , I could also have a user @-@ Run@@ level , the &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other poin@@ ter device is simple to not say trivial : simply drag an entry from the field of Av@@ ail@@ able system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens when they pull out an entry from the field of Av@@ ail@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new range . to simply copy them to a new run@@ down menu , you must expressly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of a single application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab button to activate the different working areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys for a selection of top or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move a entry to another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ down level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a single application , press the input button to switch between different fields . enter the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ cape to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have been experimenting with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts steadily . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default , the default value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , how system services can be launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration of the proprietary furnishings of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning to expand the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg . Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply quit without notice when their configuration files are not present or incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the running level , so that this manual is added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made modifications , you must save it . either , use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu File . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user group . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only represented if you have extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cardboard card will be created where you can make individual settings . additional card cards will appear , if shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD . &quot;
the cardboard card password appears in case shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces are installed .
this card box appears only if for at least a appears fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user where the restrictions are available in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by typ@@ ing them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu users or group or click on the matching add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . the Edit or Dele@@ te of the selected user or the selected group works similar . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO elec@@ tor , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , change operating systems , change , change and more . &quot;
