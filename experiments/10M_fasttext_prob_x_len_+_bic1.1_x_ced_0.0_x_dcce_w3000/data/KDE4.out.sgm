<seg id="390">"normalize: this method will scale the leukaemia values over the whole image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without its color shades. this function often is a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method justs the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intention is the same number of pixel. sometimes the same very good results in improving the contrasting of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracle in one image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic levelling: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue canal. it identifies the dark and light border overtones and jusites the red, green and blue channels on the complete Histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new upsetting of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-comparison of & digitization came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the whiteboard is somewhat limited as over a farble with 8-bit per color. if you are able to perform far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you use the whiteboard in the pipe mode, which results in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>

<seg id="399">"to the right top is a histogram shown that dynamically changed, as soon as you have a parameter change. this histogram is very helpful because you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, satiation and gamma. the shadows adjusting you can improve the shadow details of your photos or also download."</seg>
<seg id="401">"averaging the above controls, you should use the color-temperature pipette. push this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the whiteboard. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>

<seg id="405">"the button-settings returns all the filter values again to its default values, and the associated with neutral whiteboard. note that also neutral settings may be changed as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust here the codes per color channel of the machined picture. 8-bit coding is the far-spread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality pictures. this code also requires more disk space, computing time and stands onlyas for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">"this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw pictures. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the help of color, you can draw the chapter color administration."</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colour sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to store several color channels at the same time and allow you to always use your settings. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correcting problems is the tool for the gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & writing came; tool Farbeers provides you four color effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a bone filter available."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of the chemical processing was solar isation, also Sabatier called, an effect was created when one completed a partly developed printing of a short flash, and after that the development of the picture completed. the result was a part negative of the picture. this tool allows you to finite this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible. a further increase is finally generated a negative image that is not generated in photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and the edit the (2). the intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a satiation by making it a stronger contradiction, which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight-optimized colour movie made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated color and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated color, but also some photographers, especially those who are barely landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repeat the strength of the neonlight. at large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have frequently asked problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon for you to change the color contrasting and the luminosity of the photos. you can try to experiment with the different color aspect of your photos in the menu under colors. all of your alignment can be displayed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse issue: one too big saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce a good choice to increase saturation instead of raising them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm changes with ook.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple leuchure / contrast / Gamma is the tool key tool to improve exposure. even if dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you need for the application of application only the area of slider. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>

<seg id="479">"& digitization came, represents three different tools for switching. each of you has advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for switching. it is very fast and easy, but creates especially in dark areas, basins images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpest mask works at the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it's not a bit of bit psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been removed from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its use and has various parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require correction of the sharpness. this is due to the result of the digitalization process color combined with only minimal sub-differences. this in turn leads to a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are usually printed as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera has often been used in internal control. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners can use a poorer filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by looking for a photo with the sharpness pull-out pull. this allows you to enter the menu item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should however deal with caution, as the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but amplifying the noise. in general, the usable technique for sharpens an image is refocus. below refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for switching."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: an image is too crisp. the solution to paint a bit soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to paint a bit soft, using the menu item on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">"the filter is blurred, a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here."</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help the image to edit. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values frequently produce good results and should be tried at first. an increase in the radius or the amount will enhance the effect. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, smokers and the impression of atrocities in the proximity of sharp edges are generated."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a cante are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radians. they should therefore raise images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original one. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference of the difference. by this way, a minimum difference can be defined for a channel of filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpens are exempt and therefore beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of blurred mask. the original image is the (1) and the modified image (2). unsharp image, which was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & writing came; tool refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted detox filter by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">"this tool tries to convert an image to & quot; refocused quot; in which there is a better approach than just trying the picture to sharpen. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. they can easily reach better results as a blur mask. you can start it from the menu, focusing on colors refocus in the image editing."</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular Faltung is much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the source pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse Faltung is in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular loops: this is the radius of circular fission. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the standard value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is blurred but then should be focused on halogen.</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help you reduce artefacts. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & win; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filters: an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the noise is too low, the image quality is very bad. a viable value is 0.03. a high value will continue to add the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"delicacy's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your insharpness Gauß is. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequally null, you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrimony size: this value determines the size of the transacatrix. an increase in matrimonial size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular loops or the palate. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any any refocus parameters you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cuts, color and Intensive factions on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, but left unpleasent artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you are reading images and compress, & eg. as JPEG, you should use the module to apply the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred mascot produces better results than defeclections. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than beards."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, a blurred mask must always create artifacts. even among optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharpness. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practical, the FIR filter filter is often better with the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture must be corrected. this picture has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of scheduling in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothed the sharpness of the area that was blacked out blacked to generate a more natural pone.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tints enables a customized color for the Pupille. if you want to set blue eyes instead of dark, you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most widely used tool to remove undesired tefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as start-points to simplify the restoration. all available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to edit the filter settings with a jusy you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailance p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value leads to a uneven smoothed over the image. a value of 0.9 should be subject to details so that no one should be subordinated properly. please note that the detailance always should be subordinated to the direction of detail."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction-dependent Alpha [0,100]: a small value unraging in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film baskets or CCD Raue will produce a high value wavesimilar patterns. JPEG artifacts will best be removed near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all else. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value suitably to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves larger structures. the higher the value is set, the more it is necessary, as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. usually it is enough for 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"bouncing snuda [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, it should also be small, so make sure that small angles should generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step-wide [0,1, 10]: integral step-wide in pixel. you should put the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only minor. he doubles however the runtime. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and charging exactly this. any setting of picture errors correct can be saved into a text file and re-loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors fix is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load can move. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button below."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with little artifacts. the module is made in a photo that is being done in Guatemala City with an analogous camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact taken during the trip. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & writing came; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce scrups. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool presents selected image filters available to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, remove. it can also be used to remove sensors from camera or fashion; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain at default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for filter. large values increase the time the filter is required per pixel and can cut the image below the radius and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: inspected the pixel size. this value sets the pixels to look forward to detecting light changes. if it is lifted up, you may change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer be obtained and robbery or lubricate occurs."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency answer. if it is too strong can not appear all the rupear off or smokers can occur. put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a watchful noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminescent tubes of the picture. we recommend to change color or light density to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controlling the colour intolerance of the picture. we recommend to change color or light density to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which typically have been more polluted to increase. however, he also lubricates the shadow."</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controlling the adjusting of the phasenpadding. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if he is lifted up the edges can occur. if he is on his minimum, smoking and phasenjitter can appear at the edges. he can remove smokers and is the recommended method for it. "</seg>
<seg id="542">"save under and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for smoking reduction, which you have set, can be saved into the filesystem and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes an image is too cracking for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to draw a soft sign with the menu item. the showcase on the right side of the dialogue indicates the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put an image below. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos closer. compared to third-party gel the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is called the rectangles of the golden spiral, also golden rectangles; it should be used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition. that can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without putting the eye, it will fulfil its task."</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset Medium '= This setting opens up good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= These setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression-rate approximately 5.5. needs more and 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older units need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. "</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression-rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good fortune for music of juveniles, portable devices and autostereosks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information which is inserted manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freeDB, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / needed to create the folder and file name, as well as the attributes of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of programs for the code and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the coders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switches has to be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like that: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button drawing in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"that is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of your computer instead: & CD; titles, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (Annom of the supervisor) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted. any information may be given in any bumblebee through a & CD; shop, physical or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & caaudiocreator; to actively select a cross-field (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address is not used at retrieving the data from the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; up to the use of freeDB, geographically will be used at the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"a visit to freedb.org offers a current list of mirrored servers for the online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually posted monthly) only the updates of the database."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which output program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files stored on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more specifically, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see for sure that the cdparanoia package must be installed at first, if this has not yet happened."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the loaded WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be chosen. at first opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossfree compressing for audio data) on the tab for setting up the code. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoding package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoders can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodians are in the chapter of Space Kodizer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a code, you can get more information about the switches by typing a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a single window (eg. console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check out the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, the type- and leshooting of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a hint of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD. this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"did you read the complete manual, all understood but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to create everything and our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s using a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"you have to install cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can of course always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have screened up on it (eg by trying to copy something inside with the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"the first section covers the basic set of & caaudiocreator; something which probably only once done once, and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each listing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used code for compressing the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) and which structure is used. as we are lazy we split the program to load the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change with any reading & CD if the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The equipment drawing is handed over to the selection program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD disk is available, so it also helps to access the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry is immediately linked with the database entry and the filename / filename or day entries, it can be easily modified using the database entry and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example there is further note: if you want to enter all manually, you deactivate the selection fields and freeDB will not be used. however, it is about 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worth it. to freeDB in an offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB-server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freeDB. put it all as it is shown in the screenshot."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map general-MIDI events translated into events that understands the synthesizers."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map which converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet and thus can always sound the trumpet if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you do not need a MIDI-map, because all Soundcards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS -cards, FM-devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for the playing one piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support may offer for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboards will be displayed. the general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equality sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and do not draw any line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional All KeysTo M is needed to put all notes, which need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun powder. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI-file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum-patch the patch is meant, where every sound is a different percussioninstrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;), and not the one where the sound means the pitch-height of the always same drums (as some keyboards own)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are displayed on a certain channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section the order of the lines is very important, as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make sounds to the perk channel. look for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels to another. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, make it easy at CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"so MIDI devices require 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option the keymap will of course use the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option to change all events that will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case will be always patch x used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the perk patch on the perk channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for Pitchbenderratio indicates, in which relation Pitch-bender events is multiplied. if a MIDI-file converted a pitch-Bender event, then this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then re-passed. the value 4096 is not used so that in the map file no decimal (are)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM admits that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch, which is supposed to play a pitch higher. unfortunately, some keyboards around two sounds to play higher. unfortunately, to try to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit 'back'."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI-settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole row of Klaviatures (one for every MIDI channel). on these accusations see which sounds are being played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selective list, where you can choose an instrument, the button lights not more green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (up to now) two different views to display the played notes. view in the menu settings below the point of canalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed, with which a song is played out. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"so you can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. this can result the same MIDI-file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anybody to use & kmid; to use it. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compcompression deposit of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a Binder distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; have this happened because & kmid; without Awe support. to remove the problem you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's home)"</seg>

<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML-languages that is currently not created by & quantapSaul; but it can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files needed in the day XML format. there's the easier way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package."</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & QuantapSaul, there are some key concepts. to understand this and make full use of & quantapSaul; therefore, one has to get familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to give them precisely these concepts without their understanding."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & QuantapSaul, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quanty."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone, the & quanty; uses, available. tooling over actions is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantapSaul. this enables the administrators to secure various tooling, actions and patterns in the global tree, which can then be made available to anyone in a multi-user environment at the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific pattern and tooling. local elements are stored in the user index so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all available from & CSS; - patterns up to tooling with special action specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & QuantapSaul; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editors window, the building views, the cartons with information and the tooling. please hit, and for more information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the cartoners with the right mouse button to reset a text menu with the current document passable entries, delete, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click menu in the editor area lead to a further notice menu concerning the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), processing the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the Editors" toolbox, the tooling of the editors are at present. & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as Standard, for which a set of tooling is shown. in the course of further superstructure of & quantapSaul; the tooling shall be adapted to the new functions and, and associated user needs.

<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantapSaul; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, programme parts, a whole website & etc; There are all options open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more about templates is available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of outsourcing in Global, Local and Project is also functioning properly here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information on a script. on the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or to send with e-mail."</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view points to the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on a element the cursor in the document is placed on the position of the element. by the right-clicking of the element there is a list of commands regarding navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed inside these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where maybe only the overre had changed. that change was a small nightmare."</seg>

<seg id="2941">"& Ssystemic log; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. the task of & ksystemic log; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system, or where the system does the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access for example to information on problems that occur on their server. & ksystemic log; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated with their help the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with the help to filter the single protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort. the individual ways to sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start is tried & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocols - to open. will not be shown with system administrations. the protocol files usually are usually found in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually not need permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected criterion set off. in the default setting, the selection box contains beside the filter the entry all. then a log line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search file is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. select the string of the filter search file, then select the column process, and enter the filterbar the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines, which have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the stage errors are shown with a showy color as protocol lines of the level indication. the colored presentation of protocol lines can be switched off dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only specific process (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, you can use the filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new additions to the record lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& Ssystemlog; allows to display several protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindows and manage. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& Ssystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further current information on the sources of & ksystemic log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& Ssystemic log; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in the & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv;. this section guides a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program start at the high-speed of the system in the & Linux world. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (among others I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstall and reformat. therefore, you need to ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start uplifting the system or when changing to another Runlevel. system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setters that only once started. such calls are to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.d should lie on the one hand, under / etc / rc.d if you need it. you can also create a rc.dein / etc / rc.d if you want to run some of what has to do with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see one line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably find that the preset-in rundown 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can restore / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have something pervert, then you come up by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how starts and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written, that it is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains, the script will start with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes. I could & win; a server-Runlevel lets you run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running out. furthermore, I could also have a user-Runlevel, the & etc;, network & etc;)."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv. it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other pointer device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of Available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also shift scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens when they pull out an entry from the field of Available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new range. to simply copy them to a new rundown menu, you must expressly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a single application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys for a selection of top or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move a entry to another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired rundown level with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a single application, press the input button to switch between different fields. enter the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Escape to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv. changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have been experimenting with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts steadily. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default, the default value (3 should normally be in order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have made some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, how system services can be launched in these distributions, simplifies the configuration of the proprietary furnishings of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning to expand the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg. Apache or httpd) simply quit without notice when their configuration files are not present or incorrect."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the running level, so that this manual is added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;"</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made modifications, you must save it. either, use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu File."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user and user group. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only represented if you have extended system settings (Quota) for users, a cardboard card will be created where you can make individual settings. additional card cards will appear, if shadow passwords, or for example, / etc / master.passwd like in BSD."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The cardboard card password appears in case shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD -Unices are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card box appears only if for at least a appears filesystem (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quotas user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user where the restrictions are available in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually. the current file system will be selected with the help of the field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by typing them in the big field."</seg>
