&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is tremendous .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American films , danced to American music and danced by American writers and operated by sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist for an American film . &quot;
&quot; when 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a Oil Magn@@ um , who had the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admiration for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never holds up with his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of as a former colleague put it , and declare publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ est , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people react to his statements and voted for him in Sch@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that was ever reached by the party candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ illa person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not put Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist &apos;s programme , the people from all over the world inv@@ ades , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ umps of world@@ view did not coinci@@ de with the title of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; the contrast to this generosity is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , which her life was fighting for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits with the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values explained by them have deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump turned his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair for the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ists .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
&quot; that is superficial and respectful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom have been voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed it ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ no@@ . WC . : as much as &quot; &quot; name of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word of white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as sh@@ one trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : towards hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word @-@ change with the crowds . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; do the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ est a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! , they answered them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now a m@@ umps country , &quot; said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and this is breaking me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; that music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is popular among tourists , but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a number of years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music Association ) has been playing a sym@@ ph@@ ony Symphony Orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome them with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its Dru@@ gs abuse and gangs of bonds . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare despair . &quot;
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously - the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come and with bright eyes and play in the Tru@@ ly you learn to play trumpet , trumpet , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , stove , forest horn , l@@ ump , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village , which is practically on top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are produced from recur@@ rent waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recur@@ rent instruments , made from local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where recycling led by F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez to transform parts of the apost@@ asy into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , b@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all made out of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as the music of The Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , reminded at the early days : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the trash , and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed to be F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one made of waste made violin .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from playing material and called The recycled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance at :
the world produces about one billion tons of trash each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poorest , like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can be successfully combating illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that controls the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ release occurs within the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , that time had already been known that this ship had already been illegal fishing and illegal fishing , before it came to the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were brought accordingly , accordingly , and little inclined to welcome a bre@@ aches of these kinds at their shores . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles are mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refused to get one of their har@@ bours and also refused to give him a fishing restriction . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sudden the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries which you simply refused , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior vice president of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which criminal practices inter@@ sect and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and work together . they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trusts project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured is conce@@ aled , to be extremely difficult . therefore , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; by inten@@ tional abuse of existing laws , which are to be protected by certain habitats and species , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions occurring today in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can interact with each other , for example , lists of existing licenses or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , through satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious riding routes can be discovered - such that indicate that a ship loads its captured fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the move , and possibly whether they have a pen@@ it@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information , meaning that the ships could not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced into numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means the illegal fishing catch is financially no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , guiding director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the aforementioned platform was created to attract more estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year because of the illegal fisher@@ man who penetrate into East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing boats which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world . it is also this illegal fisher@@ man as well .
&quot; their practices include such actions as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit license papers , declaration of fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they are specifically using the lack of international co @-@ operation and turn out the weaknesses of a not complete control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ed to not walk my port . &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
so far the closed front is working .
&quot; since its inception , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
&quot; it has found criminal networks uncovered , the fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tr@@ acked ships and found . &quot;
&quot; because of its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships precise . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to record the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross @-@ crossing , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn them on for example , their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be dictated by satellite . &quot;
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system which connects different information levels . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened up the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the Marine F@@ ishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through which the position of each trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join with neighbours to get a better picture of who doing what is doing - it simply gives sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals , but also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships that have been conf@@ is@@ cated without a license and hardly expected consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile achieved a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since then fishing boats do more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 to record , the inspec@@ tors found there on board locks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; &quot; the effect is very strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa a few hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together , so called the West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to generate more such initiatives and structures in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country was able to report his first great triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used as a to@@ wing network that is now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in the bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking action against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans works in the whole world sea .

&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . location in Venezuela is continuing to go : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to regain the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the ministers of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on ministers , the Venezuel@@ ans re@@ acted to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the Res@@ er@@ or@@ ber@@ ing Venezuela Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also held in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , at the centrally located north @-@ north slo@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is noticeable in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro as the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately the de@@ duction of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors in Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes part in her latest article in the context of the government council : &quot;
&quot; in the context of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence part of the world belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to be the only way to regain its institutional structures and to join a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral bloc of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unity ) to join the opposition to the majority of opposition to the National Assembly , following the elections of 2015 , should continue to continue to support the withdrawal of the referendum , the Venezuel@@ an Government , should continue to persist . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil wars , and on the 3rd November all to Car@@ acas to Miraflores . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures collected by arguments , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves hit the message across pol@@ ling oppression in the central @-@ north nearby town of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstrators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to safely leave the cathedral , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters were trying to stop the police forces , including this woman in the Andes @-@ state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skirts , because you might see something else what many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile an Info@@ graphic already makes an Info@@ graphic the round that forms the amount of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister@@ ial process - this was shown now in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the road .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs contributes to this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your ministers !
on the road !
&quot; other note@@ worthy these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , made little against the devast@@ ated economic crisis and is rather busy , making critical voices hidden . &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the markets are increasing more and more in incidence and intensity .
&quot; some Venezuel@@ ans reported the media , they were hungry to take part in a strike , rather than working or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of a interviews by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was posted on 23 August 2016 to D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian message page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced from his father to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as meanwhile , an adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting in the office , the same name as his father carry the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he retained the family secrets .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret magic .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not know then that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ an officials . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean Military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983 , a time of state terrorism , was the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities committed over the years , and who had experienced before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , what great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose the way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; as my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had un@@ friends with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
&quot; all called him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are a sh@@ ole , you have wounded you with one of the ERP friends . &quot;
pass it merely that they will not lead you one day and then I have to save you .

&quot; therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would become secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation , I thought that would be ok . for so my father had slain me . &quot;
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda shoes , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; because they are tor@@ tured , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; during the first time and last time , he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little wrapped wrap , and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were deduc@@ ted and entertained me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I spr@@ inkl@@ ed in and saw a Lie@@ ge , been tor@@ tured on the people . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that she attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was straight there .
&quot; they rarely pose a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured him with water and mo@@ aning him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the frame there was stor@@ eh@@ lich ... like a fil@@ thy Win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was likewise charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance of the entrance to the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What Are you so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; so , why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed by soldiers and buried .
&quot; I know this , because my father told me at home . &quot;
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that Pal@@ ito &apos; Rom@@ ero put a man together and sle@@ w .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civil war , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process , which was also charged by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia leads to the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , by the former Fol@@ ter@@ chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way on which you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were given a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be shifted . &quot;
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War Cri@@ mes &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war powers &quot; &quot; - as it was called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war broke a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign , which one takes to an enemy that has been fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war @-@ of @-@ war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al it all in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied , and thou wi@@ ping the cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminals ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and bring you stran@@ gely . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we no one need any others ! &quot;
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I spoke in the process , I showed a photo of that time when I took a jacket and a wheelchair pul@@ lover out of wool . both my father came from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense , a fellow @-@ conspir@@ ators accused me of being with this crime . I res@@ igned no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to tell . &quot;
&apos;@@ The sc@@ av@@ den@@ let of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now where I am older , I find Re@@ quest . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
develop further and realize that it &apos;s wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
&quot; well , you did so during the dictatorship of human beings . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children depri@@ ve ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl to his house , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
one could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not even families which could be delivered to their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to a person .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machinery to eliminate the im@@ mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and broken somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I have just told the truth about 20 criminals - among them my father .
&quot; idea to view my father was taken during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atrocities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ wardly , and asked me , for the whole exagger@@ ated patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; he er@@ un@@ te only &quot; &quot; Na then get me up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what I did .
in 2010 I used the first ad .
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pre@@ dict@@ ate that I was caught . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 at the end of the process .
&quot; he was indicted for 4@@ 16 criminal crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful imprisonment in 15@@ 8 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture in 98 cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;

&quot; the judg@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the proportions of the world .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 and ended crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 sig@@ op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the judgment imposed in 28 cases for life @-@ long arrest warran@@ ts , and in nine cases pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there was no release . &quot;
eleven of the first 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape from the personnel . # Es@@ War@@ state frozen &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military in the dictatorship of the military , including former military members , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he judged the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by im@@ human heads .
judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for victims for victims for years .

&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for this lasted 39 years . &quot;

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; awesome drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , in which one can extend his license . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
processing of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving licence , last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word was abandoned , the &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; means to be fal@@ si@@ bly - but perhaps also translated with arches &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as a &quot; awesome motor@@ ist . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to electronic ads in the entrance area from 1 to 20 September and in the building itself .
processing of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine that has been frequently shared in social media .
&quot; the mistake was Julian Hol@@ mes , one of Ky@@ ot@@ os , one of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local journals . &quot;
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n in Kyoto @-@ winning daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation has been removed first . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; awesome motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper term &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Pre@@ fecture Kyoto apologi@@ ze for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text and that the translation has not been tested on its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincerely sorry that older people were offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; awesome &quot; older motor@@ cyclists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police there is the proportion of older drivers who are still involved in accidents , but certainly cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents in total has decreased , the proportion of those caused by seniors in the same period has increased . &quot;
&quot; the correspon@@ dent re@@ porter published in the Yahoo released version of the article comments to light , which show which prejudices some Japanese apparently he@@ eded against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo , via the translation errors , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; awesome motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide circulation of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to over@@ head , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case of cervi@@ x . in general , the belief that translators in the target language - do not be in the initial language - mother tongue . &quot;
thus a French mother tongue should translate into French for example from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue , translation into English language . this may be lacking in understanding of the over@@ head , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers , the Japanese language . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have no foreign employees , can make translations nevertheless take fir@@ ing internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is made as the best ones - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the pu@@ zz@@ led and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions , which are developed by machine translations , show that this technique can no longer be replaced by human translators . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be either acceptable in jewelry or at least harmless . but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can have more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city Kyoto has hopefully uses a serious source for its translations in the future . &quot;
Venezuela : to take protests and cens@@ ored measures on the Internet and television
&quot; site of the portal as &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio was also no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online stations sur@@ passed recordings of protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists , which opposed to the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court opened up the Parliament and transferred the responsibilities of the Parliament to the executive , and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection may be folded , and recommended the UFO , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it appears that Internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers once again are blocked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of unrest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been hesit@@ ant on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission asked for telecommunications to them with money and closing times when they continued to report on demonstrations as the Commission regards this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up again on @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying 2 lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT filter confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other on @-@ line channels . this also affects the website , on which the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous research @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local internet provider sometimes had to use DNA . this is a technique that faul@@ ty the DNS server requests from certain domains . &quot;
&quot; when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is faul@@ ty or den@@ ies the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , which was transferred live in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this will continue to continue the Venezuel@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage on the current events in the country . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls will become a slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ mp as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers witnesses of other criminals , who were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo by Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of cour@@ iers .
the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report drafted by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &apos; ) , edited and released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not live together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her degree of degree at the university she returned to the house once more and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the ones , from which a little has become , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she became ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a cri@@ mp in Paraguay , the more than 40,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ comes their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what does not mention , is that children have to afford to do so many days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this within the context of a contract you cannot lift . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice , this practice is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls from the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonies , researched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things on behalf , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , guarantees generally breastfeeding . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who their daughter is in the faith that she will complete their education to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; something out of it &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with himself and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the faith that they would give it a chance that would otherwise not get a training , and perhaps even be star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl becomes suspi@@ cious , his family will experience only a few years later . &quot;
sometimes they even learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon occurs in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of former Mil@@ on@@ ran@@ ger Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer at the resident &apos;s office .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck up with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
she stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep rooted in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society in the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest environments and demanded that there should be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows be registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to un@@ punished the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid analysis of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , who was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be rep@@ ell@@ ent - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go on trial . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; criminals are exploited not only as labor force , they are also isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old , when the Far@@ mers , where her father worked , Kon@@ in had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all of them , and began to sell on the street or in the market of sweets to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that her also was time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example clean@@ se the refrigerator , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went back home and had time to learn .
&quot; the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never had to go hungry , but did not get in@@ definitely food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as food from the refrigerator , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; to some evenings of the house of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him and to read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he tried to convince them , to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not think with her . &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who heard about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; she allowed me not often to visit my family because they thought I would get back &quot; poor habit . &quot; so she said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , back home again their native Guaran@@ i . &quot;
&quot; their Lord had been afraid that they had the education that they had enabled her to lose again , &quot;
&quot; however , it was entirely clear that she got for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the ra@@ ils that Cri@@ adi@@ ta are exposed to school when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ mp is . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , during the time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the insulation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
society cheapest the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can display advertisements for cleaning personnel and child girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ov@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city leader in As@@ unci@@ on district . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please inform you .
&quot; beginning from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ ke &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very beautiful , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , who wants to work . &quot;
&quot; then , the editor in the display becomes once again a : &quot;
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I have found one . I look , if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the shop was completed .
&quot; in pro@@ log to report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ H@@ ast@@ a cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long still ? ) , a collection of testimonies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we made it , systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice dating from the pre@@ history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to be examined ) , the women of the Guaran@@ i ( in which the labor@@ ers had to be treated as semi @-@ slaves ) , and the majority of the workers who go to slavery in a system of slavery , in which they are slight victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the capture of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill &apos;s draft is writing social media in social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian members recently voted on a draft law on the regulations regarding the use of use and commercial social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , they must register to register commercial and user social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens a permit to provide social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of accepting the law , beneficiaries and users have to register on the site of the site with their correct name and staff members to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it failed to do so , it might bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a bu@@ ffer with it . &quot;
&quot; the bill &apos;s draft that consists of six parameters , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; any application running through the internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video , and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is assumed , as the draft does not claim any reference to the fact that the Egyptian authorities are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliament members and sponsors of the legislative framework , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications Ministry , and a password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
yet so far it is not known that such plans are .
experts and experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research technology &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I have doubts about the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt , regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could easily control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to request citizens who have a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a judicial process . &quot;
this is not at all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legis@@ lature and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and safegu@@ ar@@ ised that no devi@@ ant scar@@ ing is present on the image , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , in the last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ ik@@ in struck a legislative act against cy@@ ber crime , in which a lifetime prison for those intended to be found guilty to dis@@ continue the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north @-@ east of Iraq work the wel@@ far@@ ress H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ o@@ stly Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards who ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they still find less prey . &quot;
why is this certain kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza show up in the video , the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystems also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or animal is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the free wild path is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat within the camera af@@ ers , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies with wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; in the early March 2017 , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , which were achieved in the last six years to re@@ construct the lives of those who were killed by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster . &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a different pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring @-@ Pré@@ c@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been forced to disappear because the ts@@ un@@ ami had full coastal cities disappear from the map .
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident in the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , already because of this alone some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o show from a local point of view what progress has been achieved for six years to re @-@ establish the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese Re@@ construction agency as well as survey results of the affected people themselves .
&quot; accommodation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned sub@@ stitutes ( in the light of the time , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ tor@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could be recorded by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has 75 percent of such houses finished , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is light at 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , one still makes every effort to reloc@@ ate six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by housing shel@@ ters ( in the light , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ ind shel@@ ters .
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ade in such housing . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evac@@ uation in 2011 were more successful . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 per cent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 have been affected by 1100 schools , which were affected by un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fisheries lab@@ s in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back into operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima just 30 percent of the fisheries have returned their operations . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land have been large @-@ faced in compassion . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that only a consequence of the nuclear waste is , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of agriculture land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear zone &quot; zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of tourism , tourism has recovered and recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated . &quot;
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before evil . Fu@@ kus@@ hima on the other hand can only be 75 percent here .
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it feels more difficult to make a living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the indigenous people and among the evac@@ uation . she asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ athy has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local people .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident inhabitants , have taken action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still cannot be done enough in disasters prevention . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those , who were ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in her issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention even to the location of the evac@@ uation made from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disaster relief , atomic accident that Japan had ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 Ev@@ ac@@ ized from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 somewhat more than 23 000 people , have been res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent parts @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the status of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the evac@@ uation areas are the most ev@@ acu@@ ated that still have accommodation in accommodation . it fails to rep@@ airing Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a construction projects that will be part of the Olympic Games that 2020 will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people encounter people from other countries , speak another language , the differences appear to be much greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more is connected than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly related to someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man talks about how a hike has consolidated their affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva in a widespread photograph .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included this week in the intensive care station : last Friday , he held a police officers during a demonstration at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstrators took part in a protest against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ ität Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma and several questionn@@ aires . &quot;
doctors carried him this Saturday and have now moved it into a artificial comm@@ a .
its condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures also the face of the police officers can recognize that with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás had known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended up to the conclusion of the investigation by the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers on how he entered Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officers was arrested by a prot@@ esters and landed on the intensive care station , his face would see six months on TV and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ am@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of Media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia divided the video on the net in which one sees , as Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several San@@ it@@ ans shortly afterwards to it . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also found in the social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below one can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ er@@ app has been joined by his father because he has killed the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now a occupied school has been attacked by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira , who has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an , who has attacked him with a stroke at the face . &quot;
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil where it came to brutal police officers on the last Friday .
&quot; poli@@ c@@ emen were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber bul@@ lets and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the members of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker to refrain from violence against demonstrators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest papers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street show@@ cases have dec@@ eived by putting the focus on another , unexpected protagonist : a window . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo , specifically reported via a sh@@ attered glass windows , to make a picture of their introduction pages . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a bus set in a Brand . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window on the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this one must also recognise if there is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here also , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , un@@ proportionate significance , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are inter@@ viewed by headlines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters in confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar mills in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar , regardless of that there is no mention of sugar @-@ harvesting on @-@ site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ acked into the sugar mills .
&quot; the sugar industry was still in the region , and the factory fell down and after its installations , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some rarely changed the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ es and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which are still bre@@ wed . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is rising every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar farms in the east of the region , which have been in operation after a long time , because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene has listened carefully to that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar industry has already res@@ isted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for some decades ago for alarm for the country , but the bad harvest have already been no news . &quot;
why has been turned the Cub@@ an sugar industry ?
the old railway line of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the su@@ gar@@ ment of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on producing the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they only left the factories that produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar @-@ price rose again approximately a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the 2016 published report &quot; agricultural spec@@ ulative &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Economic and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the Roh@@ lo@@ cker export would manage about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today will go into history with certainty , which was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the word he most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first end of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which would only be distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressing the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could be used any compensation . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility and the letters were more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still running sugar factories . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaiting retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved with his will in the construction of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important work@@ space was er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working places and services that generated the plants in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the neighborhoods whose factories were no longer working in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar mills
since 2004 the su@@ gar@@ cane is extracted only high by the measurement .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich found that many things change , but not always for the better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to for@@ er@@ aise , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this disadvantaged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look . &quot;
you have been divided into spare parts .
&quot; without perspective , many young people left the region at once . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the provision of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;

they tor@@ ment him for ten years .

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , the workshop leader mobile audio studios have directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that young participants are discussing issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever else comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of the tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered almost two dozen young women . &quot;
the cases were largely ignored .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation . &quot;
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages although the young people had not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group offering them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in trans@@ cript , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if none of you ever feel interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days
that is the day when you get our cry
because we lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will be lifted up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as part of our youth
&quot; thus , they can do that which it determines the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the cap@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ ko ( which is published also on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan it can be seen in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , close to the entrance sho@@ ch@@ go san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; saving , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; ) were displayed by every sp@@ ise that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic meals .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ osk district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes , which documented the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic meals are so common that they do not even gaze at them once again . however , a new trend is transformed into show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic bore mobile phones , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective @-@ objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magne@@ ts : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ings he@@ ater magne@@ ts for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell @-@ handed .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that sends your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to see as an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing cross @-@ flight into the com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ estrogen uses , a popular col@@ der which is served with white rice . &quot;
to Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can dis@@ miss my mobile phone with salmon . &quot;
I believe I will probably be the only .
this interest in plastic bu@@ sts can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newly @-@ cell phone @-@ belts made the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ tap@@ es from dried salmon . &quot;
further sk@@ ur@@ rile plastic meals can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # # up to be .
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district which is dedicated to the construction of the restaurant industry . like for example with the sho@@ oters &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually manufactured .
a mex@@ ican project talks about the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; to the victims of the fight against the drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of foreign and foreign media beyond the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ sts and transm@@ issions were regularly filed in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle brings . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , urged the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the sad@@ ness or the par@@ ishes that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind every bone of bone in the hundreds of secret tombs , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never be healing . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico @-@ called &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trafficking live ) , told that this sacrifice is to give a voice and stories of people who came into battle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the impact is much more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close because it is threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as milk as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ el p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) explains exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searched the tombs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father in just one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again to the task that we have placed to go , and to graves after the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you stand for the insurance of my father , but this does not get paid out because the one mortality rate will require . &quot;
where should we get the one ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who fear fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ sons of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation of journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a textbook for criminals or documents from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one , which is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin intends to know that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they have also happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories to mere figures in a statisti@@ c will be .
&quot; the in@@ tim@@ eless@@ ness of man is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor place were justified that they were &quot; s@@ wis@@ ely . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to argue that they are spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four month ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city district . in this she describes how armed criminal month had money from their business until they end up not only the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain over and never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed their phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
it included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will de@@ duce you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether crying would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how you cri@@ es . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence referred to .
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions about how : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boy of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a father@@ less and he tells you he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies which are with him . this is his name for preparing the vial of water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine Nar@@ ben on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , in which his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has already been two years earlier , when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
as Br@@ yan was born and the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of ministers responsible for public safety and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the section 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of thousands that leaves organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in the face of getting new headlines . this project reminds us of those we may not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ el@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 called Nar@@ co@@ data in life , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug store , which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades , in an intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages , to which it is linked , contain images , represented on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to elev@@ ate a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but what is the year after something the first time has emerged ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible dis@@ inf@@ estation seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to prevent trage@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false lo@@ pling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol station wagon the place San@@ ge in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . the 230 people came about life . &quot;
&quot; after the Civil War , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region had become dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
iron@@ ically it fell victim to the petrol station to the victim .
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the cleaning houses envel@@ oping , including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people who view the World Cup . &quot;
houses refin@@ es and res@@ cu@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the in@@ si@@ vity .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015.@@ Sever@@ al photos of this day form the gray @-@ full scene of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are on the floor and are looking at them .
&quot; but here , history does not find its end . &quot;
&quot; over the years , the same photo was imposed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wron@@ gly bl@@ amed it in connection with the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote island of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
&quot; ye@@ witnesses reported dramatically from atrocities , before they had to flee . &quot;
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers were not able to be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been dis@@ car@@ ded , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be pic@@ tured .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ solved but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to be seen as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this dis@@ miss@@ al use of the picture from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ missions ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ acres .
another step further bring personal comments like this example of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge joined in Myanmar with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee s@@ nu@@ ge , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported against the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts such as the following , these descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo have brought together : &quot;
&quot; this image was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , claiming to be mis@@ diagnosed in 2012 , the president of the mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to find this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P , as their source , had also fal@@ si@@ fied Th@@ ein Sein and being written this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false pseu@@ do@@ ings date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found among 18.@@ 8 billion images ( booth of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; you come from a mixed lot of private pages , platforms of social media , community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese . &quot;
some have conve@@ yed false reports ; isolated others have tried to expose counterf@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; we have been limited examples of the ab@@ used use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which side they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were associated with each other ) , several examples can be used for ab@@ used use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be completely split up ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false lo@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange colored countries point to pages or servers to be still available through the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; the countries in Gray are samples that are available according to met@@ adata and information , which are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counterf@@ eit examples . &quot;
remembering the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum , ( directed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City is not only the false message , but also discusses the abuse of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions concerning the intention of the persons and the trage@@ dies in it ( in DR Congo and above ) . &quot;

&quot; La Rep@@ ú@@ blica , as its source is cited as the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( although not known whether the original report has included the picture ) . &quot;
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am like this one here , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atrocities of Islam , &quot; have clearly no pages seen such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster which res@@ ists this . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ used use of the painting from the DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , who expresses sympathy with regard to the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acres , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger where Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pro@@ secuted , as yet the photographs have been mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , the Government of Myanmar released a str@@ ative effect on what she meant to be &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ alized news and photographs , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create confusion about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this Ri@@ ding position , which has been published exclusively in English , contains references to counterf@@ eit images of sc@@ rubber , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to outline that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists and across the other ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the Image of DR Congo are NOT Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
&quot; this news page claiming mis@@ understand@@ ably , that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein and his 2012 were given that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story to the image of San@@ ge . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 about students , which were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic news side An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the picture is not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; Ch@@ oral attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to resist that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ke@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and solve a discussion among Muslims under the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ agen@@ ic in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times s@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were connected with it , were taken up in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that supposedly had been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massacre , it continued in circulation , as this one here in Vietnam and declared it to Fal@@ se . &quot;
&quot; from the message where the picture was contained in the DRC , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner missionaries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , ink also points out , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and time / data stamp exist on the we@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and isolated , they have images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original shot of 2010 , the image might ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;

&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) , which draw these po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence related to the mur@@ der@@ ings of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the decre@@ es of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a afri@@ can life is under@@ rated as compared to a European or French life .
&quot; religion to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers cannot give any longer belief in these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are zig people who have un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest this mood of mis@@ mis@@ - and false information that actual atrocities are un@@ true and humili@@ ates it the real atro@@ city of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of extensive images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the res@@ tra@@ int of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . at times these images are even required of the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the worry that violent pictures have readers and audience des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the analysed , like violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some significant representations in the news media , the fact is that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news report . &quot;
&quot; experimenting with algorithms , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will need to thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture may suggest something suggests , which is actually also cas@@ hed out by the context or completely mis@@ used type . &quot;
an investigation of false allo@@ wan@@ ces should also be considered internationally they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons is used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name In@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . uns@@ ur@@ eable ) endeav@@ ored to offer language hosts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not to be translated at all . &quot;
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these unmistak@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all are stub@@ born stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find words from the M@@ w@@ ot@@ er@@ isk language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u as :
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ gi@@ f you around your parents in recognition of how to have endeav@@ ored for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after enjoying cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they determined other cultures , revealing other commem@@ oration and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ists on this site even more of this &quot; &quot; insur@@ able &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable , and impres@@ sively these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite sw@@ amps here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is surrounded by the worst fle@@ eting disaster of the decade
the archipelago of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst high water and dro@@ pping disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon end of May , by strong rainf@@ alls , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safely . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went very slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene standards represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the disaster disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water rates of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warns the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus in the floo@@ ding water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the last overweight people of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has five air@@ planes available for ambul@@ ance actions , and further five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies to the residents of their floo@@ ding villages . &quot;
various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have proven to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and b@@ ail@@ out co@@ ders need dru@@ d@@ ots for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ needed goods for high water @-@ offerings -
we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; today , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this field . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) ask for people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ist centre is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ l@@ crash Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me led a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed the users to call a vehicle for re@@ conditioning of assistance and donations . these were then passed free to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ ed Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; as well , they conducted a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat trips for floods in floo@@ ding and sof@@ tening people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , with which several social media platforms have been fully exploited , bring inhabitants in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

I approved the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love .
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next pages we add rights to transfers .
&quot; we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and humans , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f , bound up from a American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; These things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; people who work with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar you know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
you brut@@ alize me .
there are around 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we do not practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different species . but somehow we all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well @-@ constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , who like I can &apos;t fit in there . &quot;
Muslim can be pol@@ arized
I stand with that not alone .
this is even happening to the poet whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
&quot; which images are in mind , when you think of it ? &quot;
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western performance , religion is deleted , as is the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the re @-@ induc@@ tion@@ istic images of Muslims that Western books have been coloni@@ ze for centuries .
&quot; this entic@@ ing language is determined by the dark man , which one should fear and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;
the groundbreaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke down the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures also prot@@ rude today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood squ@@ e@@ ably they remain . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , flawless Nar@@ r@@ ative our News@@ fe@@ eds dominate . &quot;
this Nar@@ c@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries while the US could not even choose their first female Presidential candidates .
&quot; this Nar@@ c@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scar@@ ring in public buildings and to expose their entire body to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong fo@@ cr@@ atic weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movements for change .
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans , who have been brought here by slave @-@ ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ cr@@ v has made our collective imagination such deep and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ kh @-@ Men and children are used to reach tim@@ g@@ ative attacks and ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; on account of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1,7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to capture the Nar@@ cr@@ v of 1.7 billion by 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims are in the highest level &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my emigr@@ ated parents came to live in New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother placed her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York . skyscrapers have been made possible by Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan posed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irreversible Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now irreversible Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I have no por@@ k , I say - instead of bringing my Muslim recipes or to carry my hand@@ some pocket records that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; respecting Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I joke we do not wear all pocket records with us .
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security check @-@ ups at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , who strive to fight far widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ produced Islam@@ ism machines with len@@ ders , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for false information , which is already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam is more than just a stranger who decides the head of the woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole U.S. , see below . &quot;
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ophobia in its ugly forms is attacking our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it is attacking our identity , which is so far @-@ dependent , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it can impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a mus@@ lim@@ a was born later in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior are not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , see my neighbor in the fire , that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air , which separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I attach them to my arms and her the Arabic verses to protect the prot@@ ru@@ pers that popul@@ ate the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask for this to be protected from evil , the evil one man can see and the evil one that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging to my Grand@@ mother &apos;s grandmother is the image of my Grand@@ mother &apos;s mother with her sisters ; how to win a competition of the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi before decades .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I could see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her full @-@ finished and un@@ finished paintings by old Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that can virtually be mem@@ orized . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a to be meant to speak the prayers they had said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who was founded - through centuries - through a &quot; &quot; empire &quot; , &quot; which established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable bri@@ tish Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God to my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .

&quot; belonging , means to grow and listen to that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my zu@@ ander@@ ed grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; nu@@ is@@ ch@@ end@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan , crying to his family in India ruled Kas@@ h@@ mir , family , which he did not join his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to knowing that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart from coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world like at play risk . &quot;
Mus@@ lim@@ a to be knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have all up to four Muslim countries .
&quot; it means knowing that the first fli@@ pper bom@@ bas@@ kets of history was rejected in front of a century , over a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an intimate , cas@@ h@@ mir of British empire , referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; yet before the planes there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

photographs of the Archi@@ vs of the Wo@@ king &apos;s Palace .
to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go back deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ plug@@ ged story .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , have gone to Iraq in order to chase mass destruction . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
an American mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the suicide rate has risen from veter@@ ans since 2001 by more than 32 per cent .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy is seeking a Muslim name and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name , the story has reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that about ten thousand years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves named Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist , named Bil@@ ali Muhammad , was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this land . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and if we say black life .
&quot; an American leader , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a mus@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , implies the in@@ dur@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multiple hy@@ ph@@ ew identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ cr@@ v of 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reduced bi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to worry about my child and to make all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch of structural reforms . &quot;
&quot; structural reforms exists in the Muslim registr@@ ations which began with President Bush and extended to President Obama under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just across the countries , which are bombar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the spotlight . &quot;
these are the wars that we lead and the bombs which we throw on Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study called A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ correct picture and co@@ ats them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep in revealing the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades back , recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image printed , which we util@@ ise in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , who tries to capture our many times with bin@@ ed identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; pod@@ cast lake something , S@@ ay something from Bu@@ zz@@ lement ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Muslim ; the viral video about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ically , Muslim Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I am worried about this difficult global point , in which we are located . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for conspir@@ ators , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown expon@@ entially since they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially as it has created the &quot; &quot; Other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years ago she had not yet given her ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of as I was as old now , as it is my daughter , but who today made me become a Sover@@ eign Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ ts that constitutes our humanity , like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations will take place in the context of the 8th annual conference to Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; Other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militarism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are not the terms , with which we usually throw in our schools around us or who we read in our newspapers . &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this about this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where but Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and killed people by creating the &quot; Other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago by scientific Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves in@@ convenient questions about the role of what , aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; others , &quot; because the pre@@ occupation that we have had a new future in which we have no president who bombar@@ ded chocolate cake so far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ation wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; story telling , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) the creation of stories in their original language is a possible response to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Inv@@ ali@@ enable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written agreement but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin exists in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages do not be passed on to the children there . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the mass man@@ nequ@@ ins of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities which are diversity - safe spaces , where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be part of . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to estimate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller tell her story first in their own language and then translate them to English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their account will result in letting the list@@ eners right onto it . &quot;
they invo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , who is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller ra@@ ate takes also the opportunity to explain the story of the story of the story of the story . &quot;
&quot; at another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ uses of the rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; having explained the importance of his tale , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the USA re@@ fr@@ ying of the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars , participated in the last 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march began at the exhau@@ st Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ go@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; it was declared by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ o p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citiz@@ enship for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters of debts ) and the Ec@@ clesi@@ astic Church of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the advocates for the real@@ ignment of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , volumes and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial test and a governance committee without personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions for remuner@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be black@@ ma@@ ze and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our r@@ enti@@ ers are not to be found with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
&quot; the island - not to the State of the integrated territory of the USA , suffers under a severe financial crisis . &quot;

these are their reasons :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian website , Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for more than one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remembering the contributions that he has provided for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is arranged in Berlin , has dedicated himself an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel Camp@@ a@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ner , chair@@ manship of book published by book &quot; Book Spr@@ ints &quot; finished books within three to five days , las@@ en excerpts from the book cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ struction ( The cost of Freedom : a collective post@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is released here license @-@ free , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real cost is , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to look over the fog that surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been de@@ tained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was canc@@ eled from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory section of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushing for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in free culture , many of us have to begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of tempor@@ al extreme convic@@ tions ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for March 2012 in the detention of Syrian government agencies .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to be transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military poli@@ z@@ ei Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strict secret &quot; &quot; command of his cell from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented herself as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and put them aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a vital role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently accessed the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe none of Bas@@ sels Cultural prototypes are ahead of the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras , and to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the sign of numerous civilizations and here gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything about it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip of strip in digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time group , which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; gically , Bas@@ sel could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , sharing his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked for . he taught other incar@@ nate , to write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he carried me the internet .
&quot; he has also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually being one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ claim that she wrote in the years 2012 by 2015 to her husband , when he was in jail . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura were working together on the book for a long time .
&quot; she used the texts to him , when she visited him , and he over@@ took them from the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free available .

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , the regime for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , since 2011 , the International Human Rights Association Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand today in the hope that we have to do so for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption condemned director to release back on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted to an inter@@ rup@@ ting attack , when a government member returned to the work place in the state apparatus after half of his sentence , on which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison by four other def@@ endants for 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que and their council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ setting in the company , which happened on 19 April then . &quot;
&quot; in agreement with an opinion of the general state @-@ governing @-@ pro@@ secutor of the Republic , which had reached the motion , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume its old post as the company had no discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ age after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated de P@@ ú@@ blica , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle to put the decision of the company , the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even an advance step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we need to take note is that the company should have led a lack of discipl@@ in@@ arity against the res@@ tra@@ der .
&quot; however , the company apparently seems to be and prompted no appropriate legal steps for applying the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , this behavior also reject and looks at the case as &quot; black@@ ness &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would have advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and the half thereof . &quot;
&quot; he could keep lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to cause damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly be paid for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age : young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political sciences in Brazil says the director has no moral :
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he offen@@ ded him , I can not believe that one is rewarded with such a way that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is not lacking mor@@ als to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but it is only served by the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as the hand of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself became tired , who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ting and - the next door - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous depic@@ tions was , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for its ambition , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he does not change the tactics but he does not address his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious person is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also slo@@ wing down : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it sets up the company , with which he funds the money of money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Skin : &quot; &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wron@@ gly
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ aging .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &apos; indi@@ an &apos; . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or in the light of an initiative in order to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements of the word has given an extremely removable con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of sensual content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed for his use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ onic words with basic meanings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ use A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he asked his friends in the rich way whether they knew how he could rel@@ ieve his back pain by having a word play . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ically - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that it &apos;s hate to reduce min@@ dless nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it interfer@@ es all the po@@ sts that work in suspicion , racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; calf &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automation is not understood what you write on Facebook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the following words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ time nation@@ alists are spreading to hate speech , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to cur@@ tail its nationalism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy cannot last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have demonstrated that the cens@@ orship of keywords often become a cat@@ cher and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the cens@@ orious word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to communicate his friends only , that the word &apos; Cal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the lyrics , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards did not pronoun@@ ce . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the hate @-@ hate radic@@ alised nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have been doing more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a soothing intention of reducing racism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; such words should be cens@@ or will only bring more hatred within the different communities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started without a local context or technical support and so words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; have banned . &quot;
&quot; even when she found out that she had made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would like to make a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has made for much ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now using Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Cal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their hosts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts who have no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ edi@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot is used with approval .
&quot; post &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot is used with approval .
&quot; over the past five years there are extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks seeks to heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands of escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised for its failure , the ex@@ hilar@@ ating hate speech on his bur@@ mes@@ ic pages under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it could have looked better on context than on code focusing initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the State adopted unanimously a law which is to ban this practice so that it is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the marriage , some members were held Hin@@ doo and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state does not interfere with , since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened irrespective of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s rights Convention , the Min@@ d@@ arians &apos; , &apos; defined each person under 18 years &apos; . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the year 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online @-@ peti@@ tions and social media movements , tried to aver@@ t laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and pleasing at great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should be dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition was meant for tension in this actually quite complicated thing , and sometime they came to doubt whether the opposition would not agree with the bill &apos;s bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill &apos;s draft was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained therein - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must vote and announce the law .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave Facebook a status update , which reads Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s draft against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no only one against it .
&quot; after he had previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws were finally changed for the children &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who ra@@ yed a ministry in the Education Ministry , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk needed to conce@@ de the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now and this is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to make the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent News ! &quot;
the Con@@ ve@@ al Law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 against it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; follow Mut@@ ota that belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the delicate age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religion of religion 18 years .
&quot; the draft of the Change Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; all Members who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
children &apos;s marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are not allowed by law .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ min@@ age@@ .
many thanks to all activists who have taken him up .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the general pro@@ secutor of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , it may be true when Mahar@@ aj against the law wants to address the most social media users , one would address the debate different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion so generally , in a way that we want to talk instead of the problem that the state , our daughters , that they may possibly be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ hard men who are against them , would you then be ready to carry out the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations are legal or still the norm is , although there are laws that they tell . &quot;

by mirrors of pages Turkish users can watch their Wikipedia content once again
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was posted on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally distorted . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey un@@ locks the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
&quot; day after day will be clear , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series are reb@@ elling against the blocking .
&quot; although many technology @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use change@@ over tools for blocking web pages ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article of the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been released from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ers of the internet has been posted since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continued to remain blocked , are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( sites that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ pane File System ) , when the platform installed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer @-@ machine connections ) , which makes it a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is not available despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ gger IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around you were never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and washed @-@ out colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera with yourself and to try to pun@@ ish the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ ali , strives to bring about the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ als of the wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how he helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
I returned home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was up and I immediately began to kne@@ eled images ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal as a nature and would like to deepen your understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood c@@ ists from face to face : &quot;
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bow appeared . he immediately sets out , we look at it , and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I clicked on environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az , and was originally written on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid with the greatest care , to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should abuse the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a , and ch@@ aired by her family and the village of the village , after she had called a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also do not name their wives as well , is also known among men . however , they are far less common to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ h in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club , and were therefore quickly becoming the main table of the city . &quot;
it is a place just for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , and is committed to the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with the help of her video camera at the exposure of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages these clubs . &quot;
it tells about how this Kl@@ ubs made a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , were women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that the women can easily identify with .
&quot; to speak out of the name of their hus@@ bands , a bread is that they all have a ple@@ aded ple@@ aded and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition is testi@@ fied that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is seen as a h@@ c@@ ist , as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband in the name of his husband , trying to try it at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini writes :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband l@@ ull long after the video was finished .
&quot; intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; never before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video @-@ project , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , affectionate and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they like , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she had brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which female married women never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise it was just outside , a different decided to release the whole art@@ ed frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in ad@@ renalin rush over , having broken with an age @-@ old bread , the women decided that they would actually try to say their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini has received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini , asking what ideas she put the women into his head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she has arrived , she got afraid and told that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in charge was less understanding and the situation turned out into force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the galvan@@ ized red spot on the forehead , who shows the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the cin@@ o@@ red spot if he also t@@ oo@@ ed it . &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I heard it to wear it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but they think they were now in a better position , even to choose to carry him in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion board is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will take a trip to each Disc@@ ussion . &quot;
we usually pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women worry who what could hear &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and st@@ aves , and spoke about things that they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have liked some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are made to our hus@@ bands , have never been said honestly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion board we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only been carried out by Sar@@ is for their marriage .
&quot; most of them is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt over a pants , they did not trust . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the merits of their own clothes @-@ choice , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ hor@@ ted Roh@@ ini ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion break , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; whether in the five months since their first discussion , the Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
so far we have only taken small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but they listened to the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and not other family members . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women bear in their forehead at any time .
&quot; the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cra@@ w@@ dness for more freedom of movement or their own suit @-@ selection , at the end of a difficult one to the navig@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know , that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes to the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; it became clear to the people here , that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms . &quot;
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beatles was first came to Japan for the first time .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of smooth people for organ trading , probably for super@@ sti@@ ing purposes , anxi@@ ously calls the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop life in order to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from border to Malawi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated , and some of the organs have been removed . &quot;
&quot; two men were arrested and in the episode it stood , that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;
&quot; it give the local super@@ sti@@ tion , that the head of a man of man could bring gold contained or wealth , explained the pol@@ ishing of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC . &quot;
it &apos;s the first time that successive attacks were registered on glo@@ omy men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , which is the purpose of ob@@ sc@@ ord@@ ances for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country , in order to examine this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring countries , Tanzania where the government has developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
warned those who intend to travel into the land :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que guys in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of ritu@@ alistic attacks which warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ que police according to their latest ex@@ or@@ ations of three glorious men due to their body parts .
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the black@@ ings took place . &quot;
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the South of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police were already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the glo@@ omy men .
&quot; the persecution and assassination of gl@@ ist@@ les individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ tu@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims would have power in their mind , the riches of the riches . &quot;
during the last days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to invite E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH , in which the people would have ashamed to go on the road , and have to take sex against good notes , work and other benefits to earn their bread , a nation in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ atz@@ o for super@@ sti@@ ff purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted to get into their own wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for imm@@ ab@@ rupt humour . &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which probably was recently done .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the de@@ tain@@ ted Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer has been announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to , which calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has called &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a speaker , he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China will continue to call bu@@ calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully exploited . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , one spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow for treatment in foreign countries . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister of B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was released , after Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in Li@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 , although the Norwegian government rus@@ hed to do nothing with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon over to China as the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
&quot; once the message has spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hopes for unconditional release on the expression and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was not able to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution where China was prompted to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called China also for release Li@@ us on how to release in an explanation on June 30th : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to collect all the restrictions by Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits , which they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in that it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; speaker at the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary of Pol@@ ley , announced that the message on the Chinese authorities on 27 June was announced that the message to Chinese authorities call upon not only Li@@ u , but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of US message moved a fur@@ ious response from China to herself , with the exterior of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and do un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel to free movement and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and judicial system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz , also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese Government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I call China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German government officials Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; has given all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 level in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing , the news agency Re@@ uters that China had large concerns , whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by a visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to re@@ assure himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ P previously told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u MS , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police have always allowed the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , talk and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us further :
&quot; Canada calls China to protect its international human rights defen@@ ders , including free speech , to maintain and release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in a statement on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , independently where , requires . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news from France Info reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was known that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of Brussels made in Taiwan on 27 June to release li@@ u and show a greater tolerance for those seeking peaceful means , in order to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lature by the ruling Party of Yu Me@@ i @-@ sponsors , also called for China to allow ill patients with intellectual disabilities to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and asked that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellness . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been rigor@@ ously punished for a harmonious , stabili@@ ze and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem silly , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice . Shan@@ mu@@ gam should be seen in Singapore as a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting , during a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York , the ministers noted that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
it ass@@ ures that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices made to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately no land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight in front of the responsibilities . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Shan@@ gh@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended one idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal lands , &quot; in the face of it , he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; he has however defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently controlled by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old grief emerges from author@@ itarian rulers , which pre@@ tend to be Democrats , since they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , the following week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our syndic@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he burned with no answers to rational types with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gh@@ gam to make his opinion clear as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our better K Shan@@ gr@@ gam would take the effort to clear this point , provided that he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapur . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment , he points concerning the reviews that one should begin to understand the whole crew of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the trans@@ cript .
&quot; he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why elections in Singapore were so uneven even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he studied in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he has not meant it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , who , as a leader of a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am told about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the ancient Gar@@ de , which I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but this is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is true and aware of what it def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review outlines the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ gh@@ gam &quot; &quot; believed an error &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ d@@ der spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the interior of the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gh@@ gam are of severe importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Lon@@ av@@ enge their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel document ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have been anno@@ yed many Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
Global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a continued range , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world being revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I said . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then , usually the default answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans might be in@@ wardly in anger if they are held for Americans , but me don &apos;t bother . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadian by Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans in contrast ... .
&quot; it was also , when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - by Donald Tr@@ ump , in front of the march in Iraq and before the 11th of September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried from their luggage at their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ gender marriages in Canada have been legal since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
it would mean nothing if you would like to exchange me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be lab@@ eled means , in essence , to be spar@@ ely - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically un@@ important figure of N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has one own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that one can come across . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , is called in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to make no attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main land of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; den@@ si@@ ders as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we lacks the warm , open kindness , which I have now connecting with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au turned the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada perfectly sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video which took up the Jun@@ ta , which took the power in 2014 and re @-@ restore the civilian government despite their say , the civilian government continues . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about which rules he makes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a great success .
&quot; only within the first three days , it was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand since a group of activists called for the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta domination . &quot;
&quot; take a look at once these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand pers@@ isted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may relate to the dra@@ in@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , giving the commander @-@ in @-@ in @-@ chief of the hegemon@@ y of the hegemon@@ ic decision on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program to &quot; setup changes &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ ague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities for activ@@ ist activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , supervised the online content and people who are thrown out , the monarchy is s@@ lan@@ ted to have criminal pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand sets up a stri@@ pe against &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic credit ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was launched in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup d the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continued to follow , is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ boats , although security experts warned they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car before getting into an interven@@ ing camp , another problem @-@ case . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they supposedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long arrest , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which was im@@ it@@ ated the sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated , which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on into the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in the eastern part of the East .

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now been more than 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war has been officially completed , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chi@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ ado@@ cia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians had lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and dra@@ ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ge@@ ese cities as well .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there lived more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the District of 16@@ ,000 people had risen up over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; it is all a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story dwell@@ ers of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ es@@ cap@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; it is all a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; it is still un@@ ambiguous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only cob@@ bled road with f@@ aded splend@@ our buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and contributed to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district today . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ow@@ ka , which is even one or two families , you can recognize in the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother forbidden us to photograph us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , this is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining companies named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as zo@@ ot@@ echni@@ cs , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable @-@ construction . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration delivers free candles in the winter and bread to the villages .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t gases as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to j@@ han@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ le @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia Minor , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she is instead supported her young grandchildren .
Gal@@ inas Mon@@ thly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and spend holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is concerned with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya to her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five young children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminded himself of the thor@@ ax before war .
&quot; despite the relatives , that live in Central Asia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country @-@ Asia became simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we have recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ ol in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but this will still take a bit more , &quot; says it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chickens . &quot;
she told that at first a very frigh@@ tening situation was when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their change .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ ot@@ ings . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day how the city and war were once .
&quot; as our conversation comes to the end , a little boy has gone by us . &quot;
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy leaves him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , who then rolls up the hill . &quot;
a group of children now follows the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the dropped building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure uncertainty in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; Migr@@ ants hosts migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ta@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border between Mexico and Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 , on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will be published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; crossing the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of those places in the mex@@ ican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ i , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink bril@@ liance and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ta@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know a lot of under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are in transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleeping in simple rooms , with cold , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haiti come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez have already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms and some have already slept on box .
you don &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to hospital if they are ill , they buy them medication that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam those made from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him whether M@@ om Africa is a reasonable nickname for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ sta@@ che ) posi@@ ble with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; says he with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lovingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao is traveling with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston where to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel the track along and that the Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michelangelo has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a builder on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for a few months now , he sells SIM cards to save the needed money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ zzle . &quot;
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he says smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they are gone to gr@@ ind them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very familiar here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants that travel through tap@@ es@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was born to Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family in their small house .
it is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are to be sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar that night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking set outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests make .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through wall@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to press from him money without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ta@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , a single @-@ class , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the ranks the travellers consult calm their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today , and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone . &quot;
as a proud grandmother blows her to her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair objects that has done to her a customer , some photos of her grand children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
they laugh so while she presents me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; it is repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install an observation app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users should be saved .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell notification in which she points the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message there is said that the app &quot; &quot; urged to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , exchanged with a private free chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was to identify and pursue the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective services with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ade porno@@ graphic Web sites , of online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; naturally , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers could fit the home network of a person or to ste@@ er it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in distant , depres@@ sing ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dissatisfaction in conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ored and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet dis@@ closures . &quot;
&quot; the information based on Twitter based media outlets &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Integration &quot; &quot; ) , published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where poli@@ c@@ emen picked up the residents and checked out whether she had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ v make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a bac@@ kl@@ ash for the technological development .
&quot; you have forced the people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest technology .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Integration &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the characteristics of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobil@@ es are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic wr@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the town council , to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all governmental entities , authorities and co @-@ affiliated institutions including universities and research institutions are committed to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office in operation of their computers and communications equipment . &quot;
&quot; an current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , to the 1st of August to register their &quot; personal ID maps , cell phones , external drives , tra@@ ilers , notebook and media cards &quot; &quot; in the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy them . however , this promotion viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible failures , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all shou@@ ting to death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has had his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you see yourself and you agree that you are all alone on a place where everything is right . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved and uncovered , and a truth reveals that is clearly visible from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all honor .
one who has beaten up in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you are looking behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and performers - turn the characters into being made of flesh and blood , and all shou@@ ting it to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve the smoke in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of the discomfort . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not yet what I mean &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security services rendered it form@@ ulate - with the promise of the fourth time a pleasure would become a pleasure . &quot;
he introduced his power over us by doing even the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn out during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to de@@ duce the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all neighbour@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that ended up into the arteries with government security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
in the third night things had cal@@ med down some things after the power supply to work in the neighborhood .
&quot; I broke the silence , by crying several times &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu &quot; &quot; of my house @-@ ach . &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sting through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we f@@ lied to a glorious picture , filled with my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you are free the Spirit out of the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the scent . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready to meet us at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid down .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you -- nothing can give you your voice , after you &apos;ve made them all the way up to the office of the security service . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear , as thou shou@@ ld@@ ren is sh@@ out , or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes judged on me .
&quot; and you know what , to look in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did do have nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure to me when I rep@@ lied , &quot; I had not thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I am sorry not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary , and his father equally with them . &quot;
&quot; his father right with this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this trans@@ figured set is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he was subjected to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I have been exposed for months . &quot;
I shou@@ ting the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I let everything I go with . &quot;
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I roll all the details exactly before I managed the room .
&quot; other than otherwise , this time it was assigned to me a larger cell . &quot;
I have to share with just one more prisoners and may immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I hold on an old proven method of communication : with the fist against the wall to beat . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ dog was a &quot; &quot; sth@@ ran@@ ch &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , there is no distinctive facial lifts to me , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers are fond of His existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him whenever I stay . &quot;
liar .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , lab@@ yrin@@ thine on fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear it &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always to catch these time , the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of destruction , until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; announ@@ cing on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be questioned . &quot;
&quot; this was the secret to protect us . to protect the state of state and terrorists , they speak to the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak their con@@ fes@@ sions of denom@@ ination and sm@@ ashed the close attention field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is here is not a country ; it is a curse to which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ t@@ orium and join the Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; it begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that his boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to log on this diary and prot@@ esting to demonstrations that will soon end an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to me not to reply .
I can really no longer say when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to it well , or I had to get used to it , even though I had nothing done to earn this punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all their diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; he is called the lovingly &quot; &quot; con@@ fession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the be@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker pays homage to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can not measure yourself with it , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry fell to him not yet enough , why she exchanged the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first visit , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked earlier than garbage bags or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had flo@@ pped four cable inter@@ tw@@ ave to present us the , out of their view , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them were altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body , and also my voice , which is why I was listening to scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and found no favour against it , which is why he was next to an electric up@@ loaded place . &quot;
&quot; flow through my entire body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , the spread out on the floor was the perfect power supply . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot;
this must have been at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours left , who came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning fills the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I rep@@ lied with the voice of an exhaustive youths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ al R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he shu@@ ff@@ les to his neck , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but where one can rely on , a cigarette could be discovered between his fingers or his fingers with nicotine . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had heard them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for the past six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who compares the conservative majority and asks her long @-@ proven opinion on gender roles , sexuality , and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these subjects do not only find Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that are from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as a person who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel about his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly give it open , he swe@@ pt a special turn against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; &quot; - this is how he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own circumstances so &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think as I am a man , &quot; &quot; while in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ramadan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Law &apos;s law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do at a sen@@ sing hot jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the gap of warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ der of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
&quot; Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a view into neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just like being in the public during the Ramadan of water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens made an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs , who support the Islamic Action Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ men of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert @-@ table . &quot;
&quot; the members and former press release in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim , the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world , be more dangerous activ@@ ism that presents the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement called Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ al people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continues to apply for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely to not simply be sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but actually a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards have to be Lei@@ be , having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre @-@ proclaimed sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently burnt @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch out up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of numerous women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who were actually confident . &quot;
in Jordan the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ de &apos; increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch the number of honorary murder in 2016 reached its peak ; however , that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to try the victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ tra @-@ family violence &quot; must be held in prison , &quot; &quot; and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from subjects , which in his country is long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , is that he puts his music , the full explicit reference to sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I was founded in politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b called the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is again on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can , in his words , &quot; &quot; what you want &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were heavily cens@@ ored up in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ al Online@@ Program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments from the context was torn and his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b buys H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly for the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ what , who would later work once on behalf of the calibr@@ ation , in the eighth century could write openly about homo@@ sexuality , why could the Jordan offer this not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so h@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the Has@@ hem@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new more that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ al Intelligence established several former government members and members of the curriculum firm , with the reason they had expressed cri@@ tically on comments in social media , with the problems that deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , according to this , is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a permanent give and taking . Jordan has yiel@@ ded mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how slow , depres@@ ses and in@@ wardly changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; eventually I dreams of H@@ da@@ i@@ b , as millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreamed not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is surrounded by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , erup@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ent democracies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore resist . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man belongs as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one thought that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory asser@@ ts that the soli@@ ds , the drum and the dance has passed over more than one thousand years , in which armies from Western Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Fo@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could sn@@ ap a couple of great seats , so we got a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two soli@@ ds are just visible .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend their summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high feast was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to hold the Peruvian youth up from the crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us of the most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug stores are daily . &quot;
&quot; one published in April 2017 , survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region will not feel safe . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to move more and more ordinary citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , which can form these lav@@ ish hair styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
there are experts in order to show who from them can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions like the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice for training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the offers of offering dozens of youngsters have seen dozens of youngsters they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year in March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only trade school in the church and the district where we are very proud , because of the love of the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love Let@@ ter of guer@@ rilla warfare

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the paper &quot; &quot; love message to guer@@ rilla warfare &quot; &quot; which has published the international online @-@ Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love notes to people whom we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel spread , affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question was followed by the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga , from the foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ ver@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) who support young people to write guer@@ illa letters . &quot;
&quot; just recently , her country was the place of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement , so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; he who lived many years in illegal camps , who had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric for many years and carried out their weapons around the clock , must now be able to integrate their weapons again into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ aner would like to join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters to former guer@@ rilla warfare in order to welcome them again in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ rilla warfare - which then shall be transferred to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bogot@@ á in February 2017 . there was Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we can write the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day by thousands of love notes , but those who don &apos;t need them much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he talked about , this year he talked to share his love with people who were the most urgent . &quot;
&quot; so the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now will find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history in a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ quit@@ illa and Bogot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I had never thought , that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN in the region Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Institu@@ tions of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bogot@@ a , to convey the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves on how they had done earlier , in order to counter the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive any prec@@ ep@@ ts , but also letters full of subjects from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between , &quot; said the policy @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience . &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ illa live ) saw , I saw a guer@@ illa , which wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear , go down , for next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; but I said it to him , and said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I rep@@ lied on a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answered that . &quot;
&quot; I embr@@ aced him quite firmly , and sat down beside the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this milit@@ ant , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life as war . himself , the F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of the hunger strike . &quot; I would never imagined that someone would forgive me my mistake . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , awaiting us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I only learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion discussion . &quot;
the students grew up all as already war and the F@@ ARC already worked in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state to develop the whole col@@ om@@ bian people , we can contribute to creating society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this scale , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no choice , and to recognize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings , were turned by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage , can bring us something and can give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was prophes@@ ied , that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace prevail . &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as it comes to inequality , hunger and a lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to protest on arms and protest on their rights and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; from the F@@ ARC , we are putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ ender of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , mental and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of mu@@ ul@@ er men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat that depends on the &quot; &quot; Dam@@ T@@ Q @-@ community &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ community &quot; &quot; is not just over night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared a few of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international headlines several months ago , after reports have been published , the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men and they found secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; ever since her childhood , she felt she was in fact a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced the gender equality , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear to life , she moved to the USA in the final analysis . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organization .
&quot; one day , I was told that someone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , who put in difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round of my W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I just got to show a few shopping miles from the back of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long are you still going to dish@@ on@@ est the family , you rip it ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and woke the final analysis in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two sampling in my right lungs .
&quot; OC Media : in which ambul@@ ance have you been placed - in the men or women of women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name , but the doctor didn &apos;t understand and put me on the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a cas@@ c@@ ous name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all that was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absurd claims : some told me , I had to prove it by going up without going through the roads ; others wanted me to be in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have ri@@ b@@ room size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we can not stir you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she put a strike around the neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbours were happy and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a num@@ eric shield with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ mates superior the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was per@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you teach ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I do not want to award her names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the land , but then something is unbelievable . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my m@@ um as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought her without register without notice , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not think about , you would be sure , just because you left the land ? &quot;
our people already know at what hotel you st@@ eck@@ ar . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality , this is a tab@@ ular topic . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ hic elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I also wish , these spiritual barrier I cannot overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person that she reminds himself of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ f@@ stayed ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone that has saved the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramadan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now concentrated on family and relatives .
&quot; in this way , I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there even gay men in these secret prisons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it would not have been very many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped out of their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , you will show off their bodies on TV and claim , they could have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ merged to open themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a mistake or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone over the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown .
there have been nothing new from them .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself , when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed this man to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these per@@ secu@@ tions and screen@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been held in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wor@@ e my hair for a long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe that before 2003 I was already known quite Gros@@ ny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civilian ori@@ zation &quot; &quot; but ultimately has thrown back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube for , and short t@@ ops . &quot;
the Security Ministry of Sch@@ aria has never even scrat@@ ched a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; don@@ or not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children if they are worried about sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me - never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this break up ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came up on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but mainly about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel the people in the town began to change . &quot;
&quot; whoever was sm@@ iled up before and denied , viewed at once with suspicion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel the situation in the Republic has constantly worsen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what kind of activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I disagree with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , meetings , I beg@@ ged them to hospital and help them to get f@@ oo@@ king species . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I ap@@ plau@@ d random@@ ly .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Cat@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so is nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to prophes@@ y you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no g@@ ays in them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ an@@ ans have what , the cab@@ ines have which , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I am from there , so it is very unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
here I meet as many men from the Caucasus .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten during Ramadan - live with men together . &quot;
&quot; you know , many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . however , this is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , to be exact , different living settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I &apos;m sorry to be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impover@@ ished Arab anti @-@ Nazi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a sharp increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August res@@ igned the dist@@ res@@ sing situation of the Arab anti @-@ Nazi community in Iran which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ elight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ful himself for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups that work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube &apos;s video played the moments , after he had lighted himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ aries were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which has appropri@@ ated itself in August within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists representing the ground before that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ me Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hanging . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt very capable of pursuing the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to perform a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab anti @-@ Nazi community is located , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard to dispute the local Arab population to make their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab A@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over power and under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy all over Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most beneficial and valuable agricultural areas for ir@@ onic agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime , denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a large number of r@@ ents built , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region and destroy the local farming as well as the fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ s@@ zi @-@ Youth was now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General Director for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are searching for a job which finished elementary school , 55 % a continuing school and have 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an ir@@ onic Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has recently become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z , emerging , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since its function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab force , the local Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi will be educated to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and force them to earn their living outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their preferences and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi to hide and to be put so , since even Arab names do not tolerate the workplace , because the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which must endure Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi , fight human rights activists , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I identify not with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ al not &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well through scientific and social arguments ahead of me why I should be femin@@ istic and why we generally have all femin@@ ists * inside .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women occur earlier or later in various areas of life on a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I am twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to speaking in color , racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , if I mention , on which type we have been physically , sou@@ ically and verbal abuse , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent as well as white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form of racial violence , that we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
&quot; or in addition , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin @-@ cities deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls are referred to schools with a migration background more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres , and women with a migration background , domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all men , all men and all human beings of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuse to take into account in@@ justi@@ ces in their mind , both on the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer struggle to fight my belonging in a white @-@ feminine sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .

&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorbed through cultural understanding of our customs and customs , in order to drive their ego@@ centric program . &quot;

pad@@ del@@ ve against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old contribution was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
this article will again be published in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; repeatedly traveled Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the region of Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to consciously make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary of EM@@ IL@@ Y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ over Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a contains the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published . &quot;

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women represents &quot; the crying women &quot; represents to express their pain over the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection .

the following article is the abri@@ dged and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ fully ) that reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner , who had become violent towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship had passed a little time and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out for le@@ pro@@ se , even the ak@@ ten@@ ant ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are reimbur@@ sed at all , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men that they are suspi@@ cious . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in case of law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 bats and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system , which is not sub@@ mis@@ ed 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , poor implementation sle@@ dge and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really miserable , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that are not even ans@@ at@@ to indicate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available figures are al@@ armed .
&quot; in 2015 at the District State @-@ pro@@ secutor 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of these , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence at the Nobel Peace Prize . here , 86 % of the ads came up . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements they said 40 % of women , that they were physically aroused , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mis@@ missions . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di are actually shown only a few of these crimes . &quot; &quot; on any woman who are re@@ funded in Paraguay for psych@@ ic mis@@ missions , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; any woman who are re@@ funded because of physical mis@@ missions , come two women who do not do this , &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay have no own criminal off@@ ences , the prosecution authorities cannot document appropriately such as many women murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists were counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that nothing takes place
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want this , but then she went to . this should be rep@@ ent for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer worked with Carlos . but two years she bore the mental force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable by the most severe recognizable : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought I would have been victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; when I have read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be mis@@ sive because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship described and told how he had ins@@ ulated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users questioned Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen out of Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost as they wanted to say , that victims of abuse at least have some complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is miserable . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic mis@@ missions .
&quot; their wealthy partner , finally , managed to convince them that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remain without a result and also of their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process towards its former partners who developed into an im@@ measurable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Ren@@ o ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ no ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law fores@@ ees to explain and explain to a self @-@ permanent criminal offen@@ se , and be tougher to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries , Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the legislative text has changed in some points to also win the MEPs for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is p@@ aving to be punished currently in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was provided , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that need to bear the victims of violence currently , if they just need to refund and receive a safe accommodation . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective unless the legislation does not provide sufficient financial resources for it , &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , suspicion is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , one re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer considered to be normal . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts makes a ple@@ a ple@@ ted , and contributes to the offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to report such a long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate was passed . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was canc@@ eled , which the partners employed in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section on reconciliation has seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to once again attack its victim .
&quot; however , the dispute of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great bac@@ kl@@ ash . &quot;
this article is the abri@@ dged and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ fully ) that reported on violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in O@@ man continued to attack a newspaper on the ban on a newspaper
&quot; this website was blocked because of a complaint of the information minister , is read on the homepage of the forbidden paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have concluded an independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sultan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison , where he was a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but later came free . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , commander of the Supreme Defence Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the central bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is characterised by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic abuse , public freedom , including press freedom , proprietary and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on public matters such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and detention three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inception in 2007 was reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , confirmed by the title &quot; &quot; High Level Parties &quot; &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . it went to corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officers accused the accused of having judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to raise a judgment in a inheritance . &quot;
&quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties link the hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , was arrested by the Special Department and arrested by the security guards upon his arrival . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS @-@ President You@@ ó@@ da Al @-@ Ha@@ j was confirmed by Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an im@@ min@@ ent time after the Information Minister had given the directive that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the court condemned the three journalists to prison terms , and finally initi@@ ates the final closure of the paper . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned because of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of an audience &apos;s bot@@ toms and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and pen@@ alties in the amount of each 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban against the two journalists was rejected . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a prison sentence of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) , after making use of a information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , there was a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from the detention center on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ al Court said al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 according to completion of his six month jail sentence from the Central prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he was transferred to his one @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to be exposed by the om@@ anische government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the information minister ordered a statement , with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister with@@ drew a further time to the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to release the paper again . &quot;
the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspapers are not the only cases where freedom of press was recently hurt .
&quot; further violations are the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the enduring closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive injury of the press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights and G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can follow their work ;
to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can exercise their ri@@ ghtful human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ship @-@ channels . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf Region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and freedom of intervention as well as the right to fully gather in peace . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media . this involves a growing area , one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for an absent in the supply of global healthcare industry , there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria in the poorest countries have far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists in building their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Central Bank in the Centre for exploring infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic &apos;s first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself led to HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ pled national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; furthermore , I just set up a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research in this field . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always stay the receiver instead of being the creator . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it be concentrated , and how can we support development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of world welding , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and communic@@ able diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa against Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that represent challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that journals accept articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how to transform Open Source &quot; seed producers in global food production
&quot; this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton launched a salad of the United States for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s labour has only been determined by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ aries it can get . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of the 2010 , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them further to breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents g@@ rie@@ ve not only for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as w@@ ability to diseases , a special red or green tone or crane leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants such as corn or cart@@ els varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alist and expert for food security care about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , he now needs no longer , since its work is still further complicated by ever more limitations . &quot;
it &apos;s like a rock would lie in a river to p@@ umped around .
&quot; so we have to do that right now , but it is a fraction of the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go to sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed any new salad for all the features , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bred red Roman sal@@ at of the sort of out@@ red@@ dish at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that , as if the movement from the IT area originates and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement of free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyrighted software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched into being , to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US bre@@ eder can also ple@@ dge that others can use the seeds freely from them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others that their seeds buy , to breed it , and not immediately pronoun@@ ce - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ rons or prescribed . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board members , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are controlling the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seeds plays to him a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not involved with genetically modified crops . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to be able to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , whose recent examples need to be purchased on farms in August and September 2016 , as for example , it should know that the way is bred based on farms in August and September 2016 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereign &quot; &quot; without seed @-@ sovereign is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to helping others to make their seeds free . this way , her approach is in contrast , too , seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk , as the available free pool due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus increasingly restricted , un@@ restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , has engaged in their doctoral work with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ times protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeding either or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ ac@@ tly cultivated plants such as wheat is patented in a larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are cultivated so cultivated that they have specific desired attributes - from those , through which their taste or colour improves up to those , to flour@@ ish in certain environments , and control threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material used for breeders through more and more patents . genetic diversity is now more necessary than ever , since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse than ever . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ santo @-@ Spre@@ er in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and key to Mon@@ santo &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is set up for the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ als are promoting innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can obey once the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations not , but fo@@ sters them by giving the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees that differently : 20 years to wait until a patent falls , which is certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if one had to wait for so long to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions , the struggle would have lost already . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ opoli@@ tical incentives for us are not attractive . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it will make us impossible if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton does not bother about the concept in itself , plant characteristics : &quot; we create the characteristics not really themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form it themselves , and as breeders , we ultimately had no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who breed a variety , also comp@@ resses its own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mono@@ cultures shall be needed , for the cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cide that grow into his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is exactly aff@@ lu@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ santo are ) patents , it manage to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they do not consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton looks for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder would result from the prevention of plant breeding : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce new , stronger than enterprises , the patent . &quot;
&quot; I need continuously new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors sell my varieties in a few years &apos; , he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected from competitors for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , the centre with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties , meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to get on &quot; open source &quot; seed and to sell their own .
&quot; the German Association Ad@@ col works on an open source license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country whose Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants not pat@@ ent@@ able to pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent stands , which is allowed patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on governments of the Member States to bring the patent service to this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa , to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently launching a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year the official start to fall . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . it represents the fact that farmers have the opportunity to participate in seeds , exchange it and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; we try to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; this time , it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government passed the website of the &quot; &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network released an opinion on fac@@ ebook , in which the Egyptian authorities are sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; defending human rights for Human Rights Information - despite this attack and the re@@ inst@@ ation of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should actually defend their goal , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome these goals , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome these goals . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of an human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked over two months 21 web pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ related network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; beside AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog on the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ts and Human Rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemination of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he does not write access to other websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; well , the blog , which he set up to circum@@ scri@@ be the C@@ ens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the destination of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which is native to Zi@@ adas blog , is still further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported about the student protests in December 2013 and recorded a video on how the police reported physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege for me ; An arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence even if only a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles in order to deal with the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ sts are walking up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age of vendors , possible by en@@ closures and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 of June we noticed how to offer the block@@ age of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of government to block content and filtering content , on the Egyptian users have access . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally be worse that the cens@@ ored choices are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using it before judgment against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship , and whom will they attack next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

&quot; day after day papers in all Brazil with Danish headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard theme . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day will be a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ b Rob@@ ben dispens@@ ary with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air boat to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the force of violence in Rio reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government of Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; editorial report published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August , is not normal , in which they announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crime that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex vom@@ iting , etc . all that has happened by the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is being released in the category &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not exclude our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video which was divided on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes the editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war sti@@ cky in a country , which doesn &apos;t realize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are information provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 sections , which are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we realize that a war dis@@ course , if it is distorted , can also be used to dist@@ ort the atrocities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; War &quot; appear more than it useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l calls for the journalism of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to portra@@ ying violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning , as shown in the analysis of military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service . &quot;
reminder : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just his capital .

&quot; in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; the violent place in Brazil &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most current data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra is owned by the Global Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; these security measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer the Fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and stop a unity permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP , following several reports on ship and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly taking place . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio did not agree - according to the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation &quot; Civil War &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war involves serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this demands the state to use resources and ways which are typical of a war . therefore , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and for the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; and &quot; wrong balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas will continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week , it is now that the police cl@@ aves the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syrians to learn mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and the following civil war many Syrian towns suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; especially strongly affected is the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition have come from , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was w@@ alled by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled by the rebels outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to residents on the way or by tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the long @-@ standing block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can create their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ n@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not part of the conventional , in Syria planted food and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its food makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Directors of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ating fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that for three years has been fighting , this project has been known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ an@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for planting of fungi , so Dr. Lei@@ la become Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity up to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel consumption , locally made fuel @-@ fuel are used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began producing &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; fung@@ al &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards they planted a little mushroom in a tub . as this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now , they have designed an &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms all over east G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; : break from si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by feeding the remains ( such as paper , tea , co@@ es@@ atz , cardboard , etc ) will be used for the extraction of new food . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
the creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege are visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspir@@ es people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people were prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal .
&quot; forty @-@ two persons died , and approximately 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there was 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ out@@ breaks , spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
in June occurred in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy where there was 64 deaths by the fires and over 200 injured .
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try surveillance system , which monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite channels , in Portugal alone , some 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the gravity for you : there are only in 4 districts there is no fire .
&quot; all Portugal can be burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter &apos;s shared images :
this is Bra@@ ga today night . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ g@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread across the network and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection had not been able to com@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ eign from the federal government of Portugal and the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o declared :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are mi@@ gh@@ tly reports of open roads , that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have done a similar tragedy , as in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits in oils are questioned with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ sufficient proposal for the Wal@@ r@@ form , which introduced the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity by case allowed , if the applicant has had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; João Sor@@ val goes on in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , by fires of this type always spread further . &quot;
&quot; these problems arise that the website of civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants sought and tried to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire fighting , and on this f@@ ateful weekend in October is crucial that the servers po@@ unded to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the br@@ other@@ ly , did not with@@ stand the website more than half a million inter@@ rupt . &quot;

&quot; during one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , who had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was turned into a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; precisely at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it then , she knew that she would no longer see her Son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in dawn the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated party to E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat has just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt right away . &quot;
the Taliban sitting for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban always came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape he found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coal @-@ pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks , which were heavy as he himself , to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees had been shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we covered n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we don &apos;t fres@@ hen up at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life with no papers in Iran and took ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; on the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered a ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ pl@@ ated on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek Auth@@ orities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time ago , A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for exp@@ elled asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special recording centers . &quot; &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially have a request for asylum - which may withdraw for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it also took A@@ shar@@ k .
but his diso@@ bedient lust helped A@@ shar@@ k to get out of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years of working in the construction sector , A@@ shar@@ k put its entire savings on the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while , and opened a sn@@ ap of limb@@ o . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; the film was given the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years some of the Afgh@@ ans are created , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the waiter and the kitchen staff mostly are refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s objectives are far beyond Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y and retail and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; says A@@ per@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I cannot live happily if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and need to get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ serves plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where men can learn the packaging and constant techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop protection on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road . &quot;
Ne@@ ver Report : legislative acc@@ ents from Egypt allow down@@ fall of social networking Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian parliament is checking a bill , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months after the approval of the authority under specification of their full name , as well as their reference number . &quot;
those who are missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or the tri@@ bution of a criminal rep@@ ay@@ ment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the elected Commission proposal was to be introduced , in which tougher pen@@ alties for the Occup@@ ation of the President or a high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ ting of the President as well as government institutions is already stra@@ ined . under the legislative proposal , such an act would be punished with prison and money la@@ undering , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the split . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; an example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ cane ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 as an Egyptian police officer who demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters , who demonstrated against the military coup d &apos;@@ oeu@@ vre to the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest leaders had been arrested by the same incident , four years imprisonment on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed on the 20th of May , because the prison management led to human rights groups to bring the accused from prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree that the burden of such weapons , illegal gathering , illegal meeting , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case referred to a Criminal Court in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , 25 years ago . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ian activists inter@@ cep@@ ted documents
&quot; in May , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices of Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was essentially audi@@ ted to a penetr@@ ated action plan , according to the plan expressly provided a controversial draft law , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused am@@ nesty am@@ nesty , provided that these all un@@ lawful funds will return . &quot;
&quot; the document released on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at document , sheds light on how the presidential plans will look at the support of the legislative procedure . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aning the designation of its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press , which protects the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in Tunis , at the District Court in Tunis , on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to come forward ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the information office of the People &apos;s Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need permission to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will be specified with the full re@@ inst@@ aller name . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st suspect that through the elimination of anonymous comments in Entertainment within social networks , it is unclear how the authorities use these regulations . &quot;
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed social media , these regulations are only selective in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence . &quot;
then let &apos;s see us in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
Mai spar@@ ed the state cens@@ orship of Russia the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or obs@@ essed We@@ chat , register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of the information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law derived from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government manages a list of online services , which also allows the &quot; publication of the information , &quot; said to force services for removing content and force them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages are currently sites such as V@@ alt@@ ar@@ .@@ h@@ k ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and cleaning of other services . &quot;
Turkish Court has lock bra@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the block Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrator refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave to , the site had been blocked because they work to &quot; a source of information , which works with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , apart from among other countries , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop making her@@ ff@@ les
&quot; after this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install the indoor programs , encryp@@ ting data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with respect to the proposal , but has already left its technology and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation still continues until 19 May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
