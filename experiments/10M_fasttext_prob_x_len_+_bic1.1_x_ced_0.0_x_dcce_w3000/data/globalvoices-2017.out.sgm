<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American films, danced to American music and danced by American writers and operated by sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist for an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a Oil Magnum, who had the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds up with his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of as a former colleague put it, and declare publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latest, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people react to his statements and voted for him in Schar."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that was ever reached by the party candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigotilla person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not put Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist's programme, the people from all over the world invades, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mumps of worldview did not coincide with the title of Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the contrast to this generosity is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, which her life was fighting for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values explained by them have deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump turned his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair for the Trump-voters as a racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what we have led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"that is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom have been voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed it?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(Anno. WC.: as much as" "name of the White against all other ethnicities"; word of white in allusion to the white and whiplash, which means as much as shone trauma), as it was the big Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has done so splendidly. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: towards hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word-change with the crowds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan."</seg>

<seg id="51">"no!" "do the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latest a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!, they answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "" 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is popular among tourists, but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a number of years now, La Banda de MÃºsica (Music Association) has been playing a symphony Symphony Orchestra, which has found an opportunity to overcome them with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its Drugs abuse and gangs of bonds."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare despair."</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously - the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to follow their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come and with bright eyes and play in the Truly you learn to play trumpet, trumpet, Piccolo, clarinet, stove, forest horn, lump, Bongo and the Conga."</seg>

<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically on top of the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are produced from recurrent waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recurrent instruments, made from local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where recycling led by Favio Chavez to transform parts of the apostasy into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, belli, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as the music of The Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, reminded at the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the trash, and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed to be Favio something that he had never seen before: one made of waste made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from playing material and called The recycled Orchestra."</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can be successfully combating illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that controls the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release occurs within the context of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, that time had already been known that this ship had already been illegal fishing and illegal fishing, before it came to the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were brought accordingly, accordingly, and little inclined to welcome a breaches of these kinds at their shores."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorers, Mozambique and the Seychelles are mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to get one of their harbours and also refused to give him a fishing restriction."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "sudden the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries which you simply refused," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior vice president of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which criminal practices intersect and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are equal and work together. they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured is concealed, to be extremely difficult. therefore, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional abuse of existing laws, which are to be protected by certain habitats and species, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions occurring today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other, for example, lists of existing licenses or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, through satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious riding routes can be discovered - such that indicate that a ship loads its captured fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the move, and possibly whether they have a penitator."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information, meaning that the ships could not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced into numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means the illegal fishing catch is financially no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, guiding director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the aforementioned platform was created to attract more estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fisherman who penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing boats which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world. it is also this illegal fisherman as well.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include such actions as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, declaration of fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they are specifically using the lack of international co-operation and turn out the weaknesses of a not complete control system, "says Long." in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say "You dared to not walk my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me '." and exactly this legale hole is trying to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has found criminal networks uncovered, the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"because of its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that aims to help FISH-i, suspects ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to record the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross-crossing, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn them on for example, their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be dictated by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system which connects different information levels. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened up the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join with neighbours to get a better picture of who doing what is doing - it simply gives sense, "" he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows the pursuit of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, but also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that have been confiscated without a license and hardly expected consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile achieved a 33% increase in fishing sales, since then fishing boats do more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 to record, the inspectors found there on board locks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these achievements." "the effect is very strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa a few hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined together, so called the West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security, the goal is to generate more such initiatives and structures in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member country was able to report his first great triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used as a towing network that is now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in the bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking action against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans works in the whole world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide circulation of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overhead, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case of cervix. in general, the belief that translators in the target language - do not be in the initial language - mother tongue."</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French mother tongue should translate into French for example from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue, translation into English language. this may be lacking in understanding of the overhead, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers, the Japanese language."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who have no foreign employees, can make translations nevertheless take firing internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is made as the best ones - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the puzzled and puzzling propositions, which are developed by machine translations, show that this technique can no longer be replaced by human translators. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often uses T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be either acceptable in jewelry or at least harmless. but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can have more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money overcomes their underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what does not mention, is that children have to afford to do so many days of housework that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this within the context of a contract you cannot lift."</seg>
<seg id="425">"in Paraguay as a Criadazgo practice, this practice is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"in doing so, she spoke to Criadita - especially young girls from the practice of criadazgo - gathered testimonies, researched and pranged."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things on behalf, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated against the Criadita, guarantees generally breastfeeding."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the criadazgo is based on a double delusion," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>

<seg id="439">"MarÃ­n lived in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital Asuncion."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016 Ferreira struck up with a stick on MarÃ­n until they suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>

<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep rooted in paraguayischen society in the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>

<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned substitutes (in the light of the time, saigai koutoru) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the greatest success among the three prefectures could be recorded by Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has 75 percent of such houses finished, whereas Fukushima is light at 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, one still makes every effort to relocate six years after the disaster, evacuated by housing shelters (in the light, kasetsu juutaku) in final spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Behind shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwade in such housing."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the evacuation of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuation in 2011 were more successful."</seg>

<seg id="576">"in her issue for the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention even to the location of the evacuation made from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disaster relief, atomic accident that Japan had ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 Evacized from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 somewhat more than 23 000 people, have been resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent parts-houses."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they are doing it via Hip Hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, the workshop leader mobile audio studios have directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups Songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that young participants are discussing issues such as" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self acceptance "or whatever else comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of the tears, "in which almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered almost two dozen young women."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite influences by globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages although the young people had not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop-group offering them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan, the strophe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if none of you ever feel interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth my days</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it can be seen in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, close to the entrance shochgo sanpuru (" "saving," "Plastic models of the dishes") were displayed by every spise that is served in this restaurant. "</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokiosk district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes, which documented the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese these plastic meals are so common that they do not even gaze at them once again. however, a new trend is transformed into showy cell accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shoots."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new with plastic bore mobile phones, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have turned into kitschy collective-objects, as in this case, refrigeration magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shootings heater magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) turned into a cell-handed.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that sends your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to see as an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing cross-flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon-estrogen uses, a popular colder which is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">To Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can dismiss my mobile phone with salmon. "</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe I will probably be the only.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic busts can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newly-cell phone-belts made the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handytapes from dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of foreign and foreign media beyond the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missts and transmissions were regularly filed in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle brings."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, head of the Sinaloa Kartell, urged the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, no one looks at the sadness or the parishes that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each body, behind every bone of bone in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of loose parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never be healing."</seg>
<seg id="753">"that is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico-called" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "with drug trafficking live), told that this sacrifice is to give a voice and stories of people who came into battle between law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close because it is threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as milk as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que camel por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") explains exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"one main character is Guadalupe, a father who searched the tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father in just one day her father, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew."</seg>

<seg id="771">"you stand for the insurance of my father, but this does not get paid out because the one mortality rate will require."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get the one? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who fear fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the governance."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a Lessons of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, regardless of what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensation of journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminals or documents from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the only one, which is disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin intends to know that he is Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they have also happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories to mere figures in a statistic will be.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the intimelessness of man is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor place were justified that they were" swisely. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to argue that they are spared of such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four month extortion in the main city district. in this she describes how armed criminal month had money from their business until they end up not only the business, but also their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="795">"the more we are removed from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">It included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will deduce you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, whether crying would solve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how you cries. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the post "The Forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence referred to.</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions about how: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boy of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a fatherless and he tells you he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" "Chichi" "for the babies which are with him. this is his name for preparing the vial of water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine Narben on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">"but this was not the day, in which his childhood ended."</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has already been two years earlier, when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">As Bryan was born and the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of ministers responsible for public safety and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the section 8.5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of thousands that leaves organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in the face of getting new headlines. this project reminds us of those we may not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprela Vivir Con El Narco "," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 called Narcodata in life, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug store, which has tortured the country over the last four decades, in an intelligible form.

<seg id="822">"this false lopling of image and event -" false description "or" false context "in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">"however, it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages."</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a petrol station wagon the place Sange in the east of DR Congo, kicked around and exploded. the 230 people came about life."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the Civil War, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and thereby devastated. the streets in the region had become dangerous paths, which were difficult to drive."</seg>

<seg id="834">"but here, history does not find its end."</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo was imposed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly blamed it in connection with the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote island of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">"yewitnesses reported dramatically from atrocities, before they had to flee."</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse lay in streets and bushes.</seg>

<seg id="841">"but the numbers were not able to be confirmed." "nobody stayed back to count corpses," "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many have been discarded, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be pictured.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unsolved but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigerias and the attempt at the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to be seen as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook-users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective 'indian'."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or in the light of an initiative in order to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements of the word has given an extremely removable connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed for his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several buronic words with basic meanings which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written on Burmically also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuse Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">"a post of one of my friends has been deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in the rich way whether they knew how he could relieve his back pain by having a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "cure" "(ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hills is the opinion that it's hate to reduce mindless nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it interferes all the posts that work in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "calf" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation is not understood what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the following words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "(Spage)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-time nationalists are spreading to hate speech, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to curtail its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy cannot last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have demonstrated that the censorship of keywords often become a catcher and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the censorious word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to communicate his friends only, that the word 'Calar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the lyrics, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook community standards did not pronounce."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts of people who do not have any negative intentions or who simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the hate-hate radicalised nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a soothing intention of reducing racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "such words should be censor will only bring more hatred within the different communities."</seg>

<seg id="1326">"if they had only little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would like to make a great turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has made for much ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now using Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Calar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their hosts are taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem silly, as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice. Shanmugam should be seen in Singapore as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting, during a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, the ministers noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It assures that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, with most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "turning the logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices made to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately no land."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight in front of the responsibilities."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shanghgam were not very nobel: he defended one idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal lands, "in the face of it, he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"he has however defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently controlled by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old grief emerges from authoritarian rulers, which pretend to be Democrats, since they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final week, the following week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our syndicatives, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He burned with no answers to rational types with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanghgam to make his opinion clear as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our better K Shangrgam would take the effort to clear this point, provided that he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapur."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment, he points concerning the reviews that one should begin to understand the whole crew of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why elections in Singapore were so uneven even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He studied in Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said, Singapore is not a country," he has not meant it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as a leader of a growing generation, such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am told about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the ancient Garde, which I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but this is another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is true and aware of what it defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review outlines the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanghgam" "believed an error" "or was it a Freudder spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the interior of the government, the statements of Mr Shanghgam are of severe importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the Lonavenge their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel document?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and always was a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I have not told what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have been annoyed many Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "the defense of the country especially" "etc., but that is not quite true."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered to be polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"then, usually the default answer follows:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians might be inwardly in anger if they are held for Americans, but me don't bother."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadian by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1768">"first: as" nice "to be labeled means, in essence, to be sparely - just like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure of Ned Flanders from" The Simpson "(who has one own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that one can come across."</seg>
<seg id="1771">"be harmless, is called inconspicuous and uninteresting and to make no attention."</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I had to get used to it well, or I had to get used to it, even though I had nothing done to earn this punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them were alternated, while I was still in the row."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordal Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shuffles to his neck, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but where one can rely on, a cigarette could be discovered between his fingers or his fingers with nicotine."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which had heard them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyees (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for the past six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who compares the conservative majority and asks her long-proven opinion on gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and rapids."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these subjects do not only find Amman relevance, but also in cities that are from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel about his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly give it open, he swept a special turn against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as" "Palestinian refugees" "- this is how he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own circumstances so" "says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think as I am a man," "while in water soldered NescafÃ© into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Law's law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do at a sensing hot junitag little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the gap of warm coffee and the swader of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you throws a view into neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just like being in the public during the Ramadan of water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens made an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs, who support the Islamic Action Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsmen of Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert-table."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the members and former press release in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" "just" "due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim, the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world, be more dangerous activism that presents the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement called Mashrou'Leila the jordal people as" progressive supporter of human rights "," which continues to apply for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to not simply be seizing rhetoric, but actually a clear crystallizing reality in Jordan that appears in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards have to be Leibe, having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre-proclaimed sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently burnt-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch out up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of numerous women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who were actually confident."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'Honmorde' increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch the number of honorary murder in 2016 reached its peak; however, that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to try the victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to intra-family violence" must be held in prison, "" and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from subjects, which in his country is long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, is that he puts his music, the full explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was founded in politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib called the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "the focus is again on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can, in his words," "what you want" "- be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were heavily censored up in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordal OnlineProgram Roya, to later note that his comments from the context was torn and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib buys Hdaib openly for the arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuwhat, who would later work once on behalf of the calibration, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why could the Jordan offer this not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new more that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordal Intelligence established several former government members and members of the curriculum firm, with the reason they had expressed critically on comments in social media, with the problems that deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert of Hdaibs, according to this, is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a permanent give and taking. Jordan has yielded mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how slow, depresses and inwardly changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"eventually I dreams of Hdaib, as millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is surrounded by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, eruptions and artificient democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it has come, Hdaib will continue and therefore resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs as a student Fellow."</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these great, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one thought that it is a variant of Tanabata festivals, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory asserts that the solids, the drum and the dance has passed over more than one thousand years, in which armies from Western Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, into the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Fouta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we could snap a couple of great seats, so we got a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two solids are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend their summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high feast was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Perus of the most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug stores are daily."</seg>
<seg id="2169">"one published in April 2017, survey showed that 51.5 per cent of the population of this region will not feel safe."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), has led to move more and more ordinary citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers, which can form these lavish hair styles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts in order to show who from them can create the eccentric Looks as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions are available on public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions like the Augusto Salazar Bondy school, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice for training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the paper" "love message to guerrilla warfare" "which has published the international online-Magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love notes to people whom we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel spread, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question was followed by the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo PÃ¡rraga, from the foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la ReverliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) who support young people to write guerilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"just recently, her country was the place of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement, so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombian, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"he who lived many years in illegal camps, who had been exposed to war rhetoric for many years and carried out their weapons around the clock, must now be able to integrate their weapons again into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombianer would like to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla warfare - which then shall be transferred to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there was Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we can write the people we love, on Valentine's Day by thousands of love notes, but those who don't need them much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he talked about, this year he talked to share his love with people who were the most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now will find their place in society and build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history in a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquitilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I had never thought, that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN in the region Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Institutions of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bogota, to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC set themselves on how they had done earlier, in order to counter the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive any precepts, but also letters full of subjects from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between, "said the policy-student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut, in which the guerilla live) saw, I saw a guerilla, which wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear, go down, for next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the thorns."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"but I said it to him, and said," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," I replied on a letter that someone has written to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answered that."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I embraced him quite firmly, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this militant, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life as war. himself, the FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of the hunger strike." I would never imagined that someone would forgive me my mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, awaiting us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students grew up all as already war and the FARC already worked in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state to develop the whole colombian people, we can contribute to creating society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this scale, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no choice, and to recognize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings, were turned by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage, can bring us something and can give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Kolumbianern was prophesied, that after disarming peace prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it comes to inequality, hunger and a lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to protest on arms and protest on their rights and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"from the FARC, we are putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defender of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name, but the doctor didn't understand and put me on the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time in his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a cascous name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all that was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they presented absurd claims: some told me, I had to prove it by going up without going through the roads; others wanted me to be in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have ribroom size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we can not stir you because you are a devout woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she put a strike around the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours were happy and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with darkened windows and a numeric shield with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-mates superior the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you teach?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I do not want to award her names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the land, but then something is unbelievable."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mum as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her without register without notice, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you do not think about, you would be sure, just because you left the land? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know at what hotel you steckar. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality, this is a tabular topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukashic elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I also wish, these spiritual barrier I cannot overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person that she reminds himself of her past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have remained dorfstayed?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone that has saved the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now concentrated on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"in this way, I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand evidence that the so-called" honor "experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there even gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not have been very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped out of their relatives to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, you will show off their bodies on TV and claim, they could have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically submerged to open themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a mistake or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone over the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself, when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these persecutions and screenings of people who belong to a so-called" "non-traditional" orientation, have already been held in the past? "</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe that before 2003 I was already known quite Grosny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to bring us to the" "civilian orization" "but ultimately has thrown back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube for, and short tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Ministry of Scharia has never even scratched a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnya language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "donor not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children if they are worried about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me - never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this break up?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came up on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister, he began to speak on TV about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us, but mainly about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel the people in the town began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"whoever was smiled up before and denied, viewed at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I was able to feel the situation in the Republic has constantly worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I disagree with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, meetings, I begged them to hospital and help them to get fooking species."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I applaud randomly.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Catschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to prophesy you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no gays in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestanans have what, the cabines have which, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet there are they - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I am from there, so it is very unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan - live with men together."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about Transidentity to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. however, this is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, to be exact, different living settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry, I'm sorry to be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt very capable of pursuing the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to feed their families and to perform a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination "</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab anti-Nazi community is located, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard to dispute the local Arab population to make their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Awaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy all over Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most beneficial and valuable agricultural areas for ironic agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well through scientific and social arguments ahead of me why I should be feministic and why we generally have all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women occur earlier or later in various areas of life on a smooth ceiling, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I am twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to speaking in color, racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, if I mention, on which type we have been physically, souically and verbal abuse, many white feminists decide to remain silent as well as white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my lord "" to sing the equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racial violence, that we are exposed to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or in addition, black women and women of other ethnicities and origin-cities deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls are referred to schools with a migration background more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres, and women with a migration background, domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all men, all men and all human beings of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider myself as a black woman in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuse to take into account injustices in their mind, both on the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer struggle to fight my belonging in a white-feminine sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"1851. in her speech, 1851. in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology where the black woman is a humanist and marginalised essence."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorbed through cultural understanding of our customs and customs, in order to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to raise white women the importance of overcoming color and sex. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them of the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and borders by white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of me full of feminism and to engage the movement of womanism, which was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than doggedly bombarded for a white feminist paradigm that is so stubborn, that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important than ever that we can define black women in our own ideas and move into the spheres, which we are created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana perhaps: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists call immediately separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither covered, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weightfully) that reported on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their partner, who had become violent towards violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship had passed a little time and the police said, her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further woman Balbuena pointed out for leprose, even the aktenant ad of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are reimbursed at all, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also dependent on the men that they are suspicious. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in case of law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 bats and Statistical 2 Invisible Missions and a judicial system, which is not submised 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, poor implementation sledge and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really miserable, Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institute in Paraguay." there are various indications and reports that are not even ansatto indicate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures are alarmed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015 at the District State-prosecutor 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of these, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence at the Nobel Peace Prize. here, 86% of the ads came up."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements they said 40% of women, that they were physically aroused, 55% of women spoke of psychic mismissions."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women's Minister in Ana Baiardi are actually shown only a few of these crimes." "on any woman who are refunded in Paraguay for psychic mismissions, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"any woman who are refunded because of physical mismissions, come two women who do not do this," she stated at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay have no own criminal offences, the prosecution authorities cannot document appropriately such as many women murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton launched a salad of the United States for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Morton's labour has only been determined by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salaries it can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the beginning of the 2010, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further to breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents grieve not only for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as wability to diseases, a special red or green tone or crane leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants such as corn or cartels varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalist and expert for food security care about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still salad, he now needs no longer, since its work is still further complicated by ever more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like a rock would lie in a river to pumped around.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that right now, but it is a fraction of the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go to salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, no one can breed any new salad for all the features, because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that, as if the movement from the IT area originates and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" open-source "seed) can be inspired by the movement of free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched into being, to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can also pledge that others can use the seeds freely from them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and they can sell it." open source "breeder only allow others that their seeds buy, to breed it, and not immediately pronounce - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patrons or prescribed."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk, as the available free pool due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus increasingly restricted, unrestricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartottentimes protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeding either or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist, but experts like Luby suspect that massactly cultivated plants such as wheat is patented in a larger style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated so cultivated that they have specific desired attributes - from those, through which their taste or colour improves up to those, to flourish in certain environments, and control threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material used for breeders through more and more patents. genetic diversity is now more necessary than ever, since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse than ever."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail Monsanto-Spreer in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and key to Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is set up for the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varials are promoting innovations. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can obey once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovations not, but fosters them by giving the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait until a patent falls, which is certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if one had to wait for so long to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions, the struggle would have lost already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monopolitical incentives for us are not attractive. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it will make us impossible if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton does not bother about the concept in itself, plant characteristics:" we create the characteristics not really themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form it themselves, and as breeders, we ultimately had no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" "who breed a variety, also compresses its own values into them."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures shall be needed, for the cultivation of mass herbicide that grow into his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly affluent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it manage to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they do not consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder would result from the prevention of plant breeding:" it looks like me with my efforts to produce new, stronger than enterprises, the patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need continuously new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors sell my varieties in a few years', he says." "with a patent you are protected from competitors for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"in fact, the US seems to be leading in the" open source "breeding, the concept now spreads rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, the centre with farmers works together and helps them to breed new varieties, meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to get on "open source" seed and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Association Adcol works on an open source license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation to breeders in the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants not patentable to patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent stands, which is allowed patents on conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on governments of the Member States to bring the patent service to this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa, to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting of seeds."</seg>

<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report from the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report. it represents the fact that farmers have the opportunity to participate in seeds, exchange it and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, from the Luby of Ossi hopes to see him soon more people."</seg>

ANHRI has never been so important to overcome these goals, so it has never been as important as now. ANHRI has never been so important to overcome these goals. we insist on fulfilling our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of an human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked over two months 21 web pages, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-language edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar-related network of Al Jazeera because of alleged" support of terrorism.
