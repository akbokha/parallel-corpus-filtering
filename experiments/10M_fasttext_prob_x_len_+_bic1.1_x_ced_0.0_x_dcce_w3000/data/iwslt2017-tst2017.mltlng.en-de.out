this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as the New York Times .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular released that the NSA would have illegal phones from Americans . &quot;
it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , where the CIA was literally over@@ turned the dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable history .
but do you know who did not cover the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been able to determine the borders of R@@ isen for nearly 10 years and called for him to mention its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; on this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers to condemn and to defeat journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media has the right to publish the secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get these information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they give .
&quot; so when the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ porters had already done before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days in front of the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had been relevant for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; rather than fail and to bring back to the statements , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; thus the inquiries made , without its consent , his phone calls are secretly concerned , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , credit credit card , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens as a source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised at his head , to protect wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has judged more than all the U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ istle blo@@ wers to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more and more possibilities to draw all out . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology has allowed the government to cope with the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; indeed , they can do it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect , in the testimony . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet been written , when R@@ isen has written his book , and it &apos;s much more secure than regular e @-@ mail or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers that was originally developed by the internet @-@ known Aaron Swar@@ tz , which is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with each ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain information secretly , and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world develop new sp@@ on technologies that are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing us all . &quot;
&quot; it is up to us to ensure that not only technology denomin@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to give mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the alarm will be disclosed in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental co @-@ workers , the alarm goes to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider , who warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ak of the story has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; wrote , &quot; &quot; &#91; we b@@ ast Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ aters rus@@ hed around a statement . &#93; This week we were invited by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ se@@ ca &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as mosquito Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s acquisition in tax hav@@ ens has .
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin has led , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there , and others that are nervous the next release , and the next uncovered documents . &quot;
now this sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency &apos;s event or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ aters , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will seem very confusing throughout the world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ger .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for tracking and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports on this matter .
&quot; probably , because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag@@ Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples which have connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a library fee . &quot;
this type of transparency in the US has allowed to leave school children from school .
it has frau@@ ds sc@@ ams to rip particularly an@@ random investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
&quot; here at Global W@@ AS , we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks . &quot;
how does it work ?
so we sent a secret investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked it , all having responded to an attorney to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ tensions . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course any one has been handed over to us . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , which has put forward in our co@@ vert inquiries . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , by which corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability is established . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that something has begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen the impulses towards more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
&quot; the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU is captured in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have earned a bill in the two parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global W@@ AR , this is a moment for change . &quot;
&quot; we need ordinary people , who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind search@@ offices . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , get up and say , &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ence is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it , through laws this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finish the lack of transparency , which now makes this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and that would be landed in the trunk of a red ma@@ z@@ le . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ pack . &quot;
a guy remained in the red ma@@ z@@ da and looked at my belon@@ gings .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city alone and just made a road@@ trip all the country . after that , he would go to peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where is it sleeps today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I need to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said , he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I will not ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of an Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a li@@ lo . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my mind said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ing at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I clicked on with me ? &quot;
an wild sleeping sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I was given such a fear that I got out of the bed , on toe p@@ toes to the door , and my sleeping room door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me , is now in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , were actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to sleep on my air mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate draws out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe that creativity can transform it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have deb@@ ated how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
&quot; we created a website and founded so &quot; &quot; li@@ mat@@ ck and breakfast &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at wooden floors for 20 dollars .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ ts tasted completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , star@@ ched Brian , and I sat down . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether to make this a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a site where people publicly post pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , their doors one includes when the visit comes over . &quot;
over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still quite con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can sit down on things that you can well . we were designed . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the total experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through the design of immense confidence , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design be something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a ta@@ d of what degree confidence we put .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your com@@ for@@ zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to unlock your mobile phone . &quot;
type your un@@ locks mobile phone to your left seat .
this quiet rush of panic you feel right now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time .
&quot; the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locking mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
the majority feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only sometimes so who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you announce it to Twitter for the president of the President ?
you can now give the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour could only be presented with his name ; if he had told how he com@@ eth , how his dog or his children say ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ratings , which all say : &quot; he can really cling mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to release negative assessments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest delivered their assets . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we studied a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are at age and place . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most like .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social prec@@ ursor .
it is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments .
&quot; if one has less than three points , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; however , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preference .
&quot; moreover , we learned that confidence depends on how much you cost from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one tells a little about how &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us a lot about how , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I do my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create with design to make this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text field , to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something . &quot;
&quot; our entire company relies on the hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudices against foreigners . &quot;
&quot; with what we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than willing to aver@@ t these prejudices . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a demand that had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything is smoothly running .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties to be celebrated or dwell@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I collabor@@ ated in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think of it .
&quot; the disappointment , which one h@@ ears in the voice of the wor@@ ship@@ pers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
fortunately of the 123 millions of nights had only a fraction of the problem .
for people trusted each other rightly .
&quot; when confidence is working , it can be mir@@ r@@ able . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even ended up blood for the required operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , who tend to become heart an@@ ar@@ ctic due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are genuine protective organ that can save life , even though they don &apos;t know one thing . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want to feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
they leave a even longer stay without calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay runs .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fits together ?
it is a business trade .
&quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; le@@ ased &quot; &quot; to name now , the cause will not do justice . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay out a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; traveling by now , it is fast and reliable with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
but what would be when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ?
&quot; what would be if at any place you have visited , a group there would be waiting to make a thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ished and to show a pub in a pub / pub that one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to make apartments of the ground together ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would share the thoughts of a common share ?
I imagine cities that allow us to society and relations rather than lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places belonging to the government . &quot;
&quot; were now residents offered . students , who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were taught to people whose children were moved out . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger or even hosts . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
it gave us similar websites .
so why has exactly our works ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound prejudices .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost over@@ power@@ ing .
every time I have to think about when a red Maz@@ da goes past me by .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , subjected to bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Moslems , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee house -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
&quot; a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ er @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to have chosen .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met my decision to ou@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a homo@@ sexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose the hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head @-@ gear . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ ati@@ m was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and on the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adjust myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents just passive .
I have had with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought after he asked questions , doubt@@ ful and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt like someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American Dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had dinner at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ der &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once the smoke , planes flo@@ wn in buildings , people sp@@ las@@ ers from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into revolt .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I joined the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorist &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; near descent &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the n@@ u kin@@ dle me the works of others from a civil war in an susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I was driving -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a mus@@ lim@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d gently , &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; vel@@ ing you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and people who held out for Muslims , and smote free . &quot;
there were really br@@ ass@@ aults on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should remain at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who had attacked this land our country attacked .
I have swe@@ pt the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to express themselves constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations which are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish and close Muslim and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ignant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one can only be found under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all the other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , instruc@@ tors and Olympi@@ oni@@ ks . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces free , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visits of a mosque is leading to look at people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , Washington recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are removed in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it starts online . as a first person , the person is trun@@ cated by their church , so that the extre@@ mi@@ cian who believe the terrorists are the true Muslims and anyone who desp@@ ise its behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
eventually a group like the IS reveals its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to your imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups assert their ideology reasons in their &quot; sacred book . &quot;
&quot; but when you thro@@ ws a look at it , it does not drives what they are las@@ hing in their &quot; &quot; Holy Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was just the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , they could only bring into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization of extremis@@ ts that gave her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m turned the connection to God and of her church again .
&quot; rather than acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways to make a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , keep it before being able to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ ophobia and my family concerns me .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear work out every day on our democracy to our freedom of thought ?
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , we pass at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you declare Test@@ es news in which negative about Muslims , they voted for more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at the same time the mood against Muslims upward , between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two constitu@@ encies .
&quot; so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ pin the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Moslems is an early warning .
&quot; we may feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear f@@ ells all of us . &quot;
for the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ism it is not just about to explain themselves .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athle@@ te .
&quot; he was at the dental Fac@@ ulty , talented , very promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man was , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is out of my frat@@ ernity , such a sealed young man had become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she murdered , the same as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was posted during the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , like with a execution , after having pronoun@@ cements on Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he rose eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so go back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or are we safe at home ?
&quot; we possessed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we left our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we ro@@ de , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and forth my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw , caused me to stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
in that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they have the courage and sympathy of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to make your number safe ?
or will you connect those that mean : we are better than that .
thank you .
thanks beautiful !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding an TE@@ D@@ Talk , an thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say fool you . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual how it permits .
&quot; looking to Muslims throughout the world , and I did that with the greatest ever done study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am not an exception in any respect .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for hob@@ ler , is about to be a billi@@ on@@ ical store . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . &quot;
&quot; before air parcel has incorporated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; through interaction , air machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ use structures .
they have learned to wear loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an flavors of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aer@@ ator has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board , what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level . e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter .
&quot; a plane that tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance travel , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a downside . &quot;
a restriction of tail@@ oring is that it is sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind @-@ bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft is no matter able to regain the optimum position and improve the performance by exercising .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce ourselves basic abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that work together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only two moti@@ ons had : a pro@@ pl@@ eller and a tail@@ der . &quot;
&quot; long ago , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
this is the Mon@@ bu@@ - the mechan@@ ically easiest @-@ served aircraft . it was invented recently .
&quot; it has only one movable part , a pro@@ pane , &quot;
&quot; no sn@@ ap , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ator or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in the inner life so much so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the likelihood to throw it just properly when all watch it is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ a is a practice in pleasures , this machine is here , the omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not symm@@ et@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the proper capacity , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ pane . &quot;
&quot; some is set in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see this in .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers engines .
this turns in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other side @-@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted . &quot;
&quot; we will demonstrate this , by making a half air@@ worthy air@@ worthy . &quot;
the last demonstration studied synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous and coordinated units enables a range of esthe@@ tic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a disk bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit . &quot;
hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as far as you want to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for guys like us the wages lies in the development and the creation of the work .
&quot; it serves as a memory , as wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the icing on the cake . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very distant galaxy two black holes in each other and faster , they turned so the mass of three son@@ es in a tenth of a tenth in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment glo@@ wed them bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but its energy put it free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was taken into space @-@ time fabric and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; first , we first arrange the events tim@@ ed . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ dimensional life emerged on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , men and -- God stand with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group was particularly mu@@ dd@@ led -- R@@ ai We@@ iss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that are about through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of LIG@@ O has greatly improved what the recognition performance enormously improved .
that &apos;s why you are now called Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O was started for a final test run to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes are through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my To@@ d@@ kran@@ ken father .
&quot; after all , that was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that which I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physic@@ ist on MIT . he has been investig@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ codi@@ fication in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; during the passing of the wave , the space and its total content are stretched towards one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses of rel@@ ativity are often a correct formal dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ st@@ ling , stretching and du@@ st@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched during the advent of the waves and el@@ ong@@ ated . the stretch of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 performer , one declared the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , the length would have to be measured less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic rec@@ ess . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ N , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are huge . &quot;
&quot; physic@@ ists are resour@@ ce@@ ful and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 and 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott says to LIG@@ O is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial elev@@ ators , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite convenient . because so you can customize an image or map of things by taking advantage of several points coming around you .
at killing is that different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we listen to specific properties such as key and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob , it breaks down . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but when we look at changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wav@@ e@@ pattern in sh@@ ale , we can literally speak the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , it can tell us about a collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , cur@@ ses simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
rot@@ ate the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change . that sounds like the Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu &quot;
&quot; it is a sort of movement @-@ vocabulary , engra@@ ined into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listening to LIG@@ N : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ f@@ acher sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your bl@@ ender . &quot;
AA : let us consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns that revol@@ ve each hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces in front of you .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ N p@@ aves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much of all we can -- almost or basically -- not to see .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ hed stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about space .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes are happening but in the core , which is hidden behind thousand kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the judgment : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the urine is covered with its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; with the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
and most importantly : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see and of whom we don &apos;t have any idea of . things we just discover by listening .
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O found the same in the first attempt things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars that produces black holes , like LIG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so as to speak the gri@@ ps for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O will allow us a completely different angle to the events of All , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; that I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I feared , recti@@ fy my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes that my life changed deeply , on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ ating , I need milk for my beak @-@ beak . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
that yes was the beginning
&quot; I am swe@@ ar to swe@@ ar a new attitude in my family . from that I swe@@ ar me , always with them to play , as soon as you ask myself . no matter what I am doing just , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a striking side @-@ effect : only recently , I really understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; sa@@ ws to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am writing . I think things , you get to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cir@@ cl@@ ed TV . I bla@@ ze television .
&quot; I make TV , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours a program into the world .
four television programs ; 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
&quot; each shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV broad@@ casting can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days by four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , three shows , which simultaneously in production , 4 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series running each other on Thursday night .
&quot; all over the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are programmes that I have created myself and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I must find time , really silent , creative time to get my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , all around the world . &quot;
you know who still does it ?
&quot; no one , which is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say to you so that all of you that work so hard as you &apos;re now a company , a country or a classroom to take me seriously if I speak about work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just talk about the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work hard , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am gone into working , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on , as m@@ old I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; for example , you have a high tone , song a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
&quot; a buzz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and sums up like a busy road , I could go for ever on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m talking to writing , that writing me is joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong she does .
&quot; but the sums -- when I began working with television production when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this matter , this buzz , this energy . &quot;
the buzz is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz of God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , you may not be different from size . &quot;
&quot; feeling no different to be able to strive than to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what we call the buzz .
or maybe it is also a work@@ a@@ holic too .
perhaps it is said that genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not want it to question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more things there , the more things there , the more they watch , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I give , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only this buzz ?
and then it stops the buzz .
&quot; revised , over@@ claimed , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the buzz stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single working institute . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom@@ my will not be there , but you can write my D@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; estimated , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were up . &quot;
the buzz of the engine was das@@ hed .
I loved my job no more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , closed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , but a Titan sleeps , does not give up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; ha@@ l you out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you work , you are working to be a banker , a banker , a mother who knows how to feel the buzz when the buzz stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ceas@@ es , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; Ask a question .
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late off and she says , &quot; M@@ om , Do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will no say no , when two things will be aware of : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
&quot; it calls no one no more &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan , and my money mour@@ ned , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , Do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters meet , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of summ@@ ar@@ iness , can I do nothing except to fit . &quot;
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am sil@@ ently .
&quot; the land , which I give , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax rock , and the song in which it can release a lot , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Iron Cur@@ gin . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy @-@ ub comes in .
&quot; and this is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the buzz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel as if I get to know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the working environment , the titan@@ ium dioxide , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe my brain and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums of money is . &quot;
the amount of money is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depends on love .
the sums of money is the flow that comes from the joy of life .
the real sums of money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignored the pressure of history , the necessary tasks , the anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sums of money is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums of God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered with me the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little bit of love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I &apos;m doing this as a general rule that I can rid myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be that easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing does not play to me as they work .
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to be at home at the workplace .
&quot; this con@@ fession is painful , because what kind of man do you prefer to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am so relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we live in the garden around , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
we make small dance parties .
we sing and playing ball .
we Zer@@ plat@@ ted so@@ ap@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always throw after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fulfilled me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! let them always tell Yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are quite right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child can be found less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes , up to them that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ ak@@ et@@ le or K@@ ek replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the play !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are praying . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in store !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ loving , my world . they do not have to be the children . it is to feel the sums of peace to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to play &quot; Games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and store it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I narrow and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the apprenticeship when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece why don &apos;t have a total of 15 minutes to treat ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the buzz came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flowing in and I find myself in my office . I hear a familiar melody , it fills me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas . I use it to its ful@@ lest and I love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the buzz ; the buzz is not me ... no more .
&quot; soap , and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the buzz of the work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is my case that I &apos;m a Titan , I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem is playing . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country , which I am , the marathon , I run , the v@@ ases , the buzz , the buzz , the other , the sums of money : the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel that amounts , the more this unusual , be@@ ading , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more me ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this buzz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am writing . I think things , I get you up to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and to play more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very frustrating that the brain , as opposed to other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have an abi@@ ding , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; &quot; low @-@ stag stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one can influence a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered under fierce tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is to restore the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ dentist and worked day and night in the notebook .
often I cat@@ ered patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain asc@@ ending and the skull must increase .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull of flow . &quot;
you sometimes have to remove a part of your brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away bra@@ zed brain mass , we decided to analyse ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted cells to grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue cell , comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there were Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ology lesson that stem cells are in@@ mature cells which can turn into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get these types of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells held different .
&quot; they were divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like tribal cells , but looked different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our major @-@ stag cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the decay of the brain .
but why stay they kept to us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our regular cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non@@ linguistic area , and then the cells will cultivate as much as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they are subsequently figur@@ able to mark them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we are committed to the reception of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ os@@ plan@@ ation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we util@@ ise these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we pul@@ sing the same cells in the bra@@ id brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkey .
&quot; in the first scenario , we were cut off the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they had completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we had a violation of and cut @-@ up precisely the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells which were cut off .
&quot; evidence that they show are these small d@@ ots . these are the cells , which we inherited in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
&quot; these cells also help a monkey , to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ? &quot;
&quot; so , we arranged monkeys with a manual destiny task . &quot;
they had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very well .
&quot; when she had reached a stable fate level , we last in the mot@@ orized cor@@ tex the hand@@ craft sector . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they spontaneously reco@@ vering up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover by means of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they rest at a certain extent , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , which recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide roughly 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we use the cells in honour : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne that is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in the human being . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill out about two kilograms papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : looking into the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes you to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate if it &apos;s useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply it to a multi@@ centr@@ alised study . &quot;
one must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thanks for your visit with TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it actually is , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as an imm@@ utable truths .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have doubt@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy com@@ eth with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not influence the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sti@@ ff friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would change when it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I pray you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ery democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are painted , our future glo@@ omy , and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ apple Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain mountain , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize its Gem@@ ini @-@ Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is a wealth of spar@@ ers and corporations , which are too anxious to invest , where it would be productive and income , with which one needed to carry the debt mountain , and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars were put together in the U.S. , in England and the eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial installations , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , go@@ ings , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars sounds after a lot of money , until you compare it to the $ 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion dollars , which at the same time cuts down in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the property prices . &quot;
&quot; so , debt and non @-@ productive capital form the Twin Towers that are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 years old are unemployed in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that stems from fear , the prophecy of the O@@ ra@@ k@@ el could be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
&quot; wanted the circumstances , which lead to it that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ sty with capitalism --
&quot; its most powerful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the saving of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , in which the Free and the poor control the poor as a majority . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included naturally too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ical democracy because of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive part of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she was the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , to give them the right to political co@@ determination with equal voting rights in questions of state deposits . &quot;
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
&quot; like a candle , which lit very light , she is also burned out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democracies does not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our Liber@@ al democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible when the full separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been confined to politics , so as the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic one . &quot;
&quot; in our present democracies , it has progres@@ sed since the time that this separation of politics and the economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two and the economy is gradually migr@@ ated to politics . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they are in the past ?
it is not on a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because that one can be in the government today and not in power because the power of politics is emigr@@ ated to the economy , and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about something like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that are so sustainable the animals , from which it fe@@ eds itself , dec@@ im@@ ated that she ends at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that politics has so far can@@ ni@@ fied that it grows by the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corporations growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the more successful the capitalism ever distri@@ butes the &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; the higher the twin summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is right , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea about 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t quite good .
&quot; the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only restored by a miracle , as in the ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : to create the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ ck@@ worker by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation is higher , the wast@@ es higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts more deeply , just as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ organise the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and that we respect the re@@ unified field of observation , otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has brought up the technical achievement , which he brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve man and people stuck their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what sk@@ ate it , how could it look , this &quot; star tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to call you soon , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to next , and the company -- no matter what one is working -- is property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all incomes come from capital and out of revenue and the concept of wage work is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , who do not work therein , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labor , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately not a splendid twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 major emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that all trade trading in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investments are scarce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time there was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have taken it , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is simultaneously liber@@ ated , in which they pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ an@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , globally keyboard . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine genuine democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to work politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have said just is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ union of politics and economy is ... Do not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline of overall economic demand that represents Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next one , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also completely hospitable . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you do not think sufficiently . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you told you very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I must say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about what the democratic development concerns .
&quot; what can be observed in China now , resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now throw out what has done to do what the West has done in the 19th century , spro@@ ut from hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many audience members are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I left that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half of six months later ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the permanent denial of denial means that a massive displ@@ ac@@ ement of the Eurozone will continue , and continues to massi@@ vely increase the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was that this denial revealed -- &quot;
&quot; it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the European group , continues to deny the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get a economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism into life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when change occurs , it happens to the corrupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a tense situation , he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to the case , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the res@@ sions that were going through the euro zone . &quot;
they did not want to confess that she had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nom@@ in@@ al GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika of the don@@ ors who has imposed us this policy , and a : &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive push of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot;
&quot; for if they do not survive , they will be cor@@ t@@ ally demon@@ ised and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we rep@@ el ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you have been with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago .
Roy Price is the manager at Amazon Studios ;
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a refres@@ hed and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for doing the shows and content , the Amazon will produce . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series already that Roy can not select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located at the right of this turn . &quot;
this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating comes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review .
&quot; if your show will be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addic@@ tive , where , after one looked at a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , for I think you already need special intelligence to &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is more thinking about the mean bul@@ b@@ ulation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not fond of . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon do something , therefore , Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he considers a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and choose eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch any free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon exist in vain thing , one does not attack correctly ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you are ski@@ ps or check again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data , in order to then decide what show them to produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they gather the data , process this and from it follows the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four re@@ public@@ ans sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does somebody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; Alpha &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time at another company , another manager is placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organising a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they show the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; house of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has donated a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
&quot; because logic says somehow , that it should work with everything . &quot;
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then one should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you get optimized through very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis does not work , then this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
&quot; no . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room comes in touch with this software . come in touch with that , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the US and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; middle television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there is evidence of this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the dates of rever@@ ted companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can fores@@ ee through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the vi@@ ous way , pre@@ dict -- by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year by year , until there was no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed at companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all this errors of influ@@ x data flows in decisions of life -- in the workplace , in the case of law , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have realized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first place , you put this problem in its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a broad , you put together the items again to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the parts back together and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to sit back again , even if the information is incomplete , so that the information is incomplete , especially when it is the brain &apos;s brain . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and minds where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which did not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their choices , first when they chose TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
before the data was made it was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ ap or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will take it later with a Techni@@ que .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the after@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them through something much more cl@@ ums@@ y , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the base structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball will be cl@@ ums@@ y and cl@@ utter@@ ed . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that in spite of the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
