<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular released that the NSA would have illegal phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, where the CIA was literally overturned the drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not cover the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been able to determine the borders of Risen for nearly 10 years and called for him to mention its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistle-blowers to condemn and to defeat journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media has the right to publish the secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get these information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters had already done before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days in front of the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had been relevant for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than fail and to bring back to the statements, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"thus the inquiries made, without its consent, his phone calls are secretly concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, credit credit card, and even travel-wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistle-blowers and risens as a source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised at his head, to protect whistle-blowers. but instead, the judiciary has judged more than all the U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle blowers to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more and more possibilities to draw all out."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology has allowed the government to cope with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"indeed, they can do it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the testimony."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet been written, when Risen has written his book, and it's much more secure than regular e-mail or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistle-blowers that was originally developed by the internet-known Aaron Swartz, which is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with each ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world develop new spon technologies that are jeopardizing us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is up to us to ensure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have a way to give misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the alarm will be disclosed in the care of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental co-workers, the alarm goes to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leak of the story has been published.] [the" Panama Papers "wrote," "[we bast Robert Palmer of Global Waters rushed around a statement.] This week we were invited by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosseca"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as mosquito Fonseca and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's acquisition in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin has led, over a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there, and others that are nervous the next release, and the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the Plot of an agency's event or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Waters, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will seem very confusing throughout the world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a Matrjoschkapuger.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for tracking and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably, because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens function, MosbagFonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples which have connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a library fee."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed to leave school children from school.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has frauds scams to rip particularly anrandom investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here at Global WAS, we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a secret investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it, all having responded to an attorney to our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all pretensions. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course any one has been handed over to us. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which has put forward in our covert inquiries."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leaders, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, by which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability is established."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very comforting, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I really see that something has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen the impulses towards more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have earned a bill in the two parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global WAR, this is a moment for change."</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind searchoffices."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, get up and say," Intransparence is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it, through laws this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finish the lack of transparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost abducted and that would be landed in the trunk of a red mazle."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backpack."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy remained in the red mazda and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city alone and just made a roadtrip all the country. after that, he would go to peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where is it sleeps today? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I don't know it. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I need to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said, he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I will not abducted in the trunk of an Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a lilo. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my mind said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I staring at the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what have I clicked on with me? "</seg>
<seg id="114">An wild sleeping sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I was given such a fear that I got out of the bed, on toe ptoes to the door, and my sleeping room door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me, is now in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, were actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to sleep on my air mattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe that creativity can transform it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have debated how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"we created a website and founded so" "limatck and breakfast" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]."</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure that our cheese-ham Omelts tasted completely different because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, starched Brian, and I sat down."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make this a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to investors:" we want to create a site where people publicly post pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, their doors one includes when the visit comes over. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"this will be the next big thing!" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still quite consolation, would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can sit down on things that you can well. we were designed."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the total experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through the design of immense confidence, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tad of what degree confidence we put.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comforzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocks mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet rush of panic you feel right now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">"the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocking mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only sometimes so who has actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce it to Twitter for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now give the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour could only be presented with his name; if he had told how he cometh, how his dog or his children say?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 ratings, which all say:" he can really cling mobile phones! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to release negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest delivered their assets."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we studied a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are at age and place."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most like.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social precursor.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three points, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"however, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that confidence depends on how much you cost from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells a little about how" "hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us a lot about how, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text field, to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something."</seg>
<seg id="193">"our entire company relies on the hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than willing to avert these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a demand that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything is smoothly running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties to be celebrated or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I collaborated in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which one hears in the voice of the worshippers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately of the 123 millions of nights had only a fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence is working, it can be mirrable."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended up blood for the required operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to become heart anarctic due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are genuine protective organ that can save life, even though they don't know one thing."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car into the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want to feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave a even longer stay without calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay runs.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fits together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a business trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just" "leased" "to name now, the cause will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay out a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"traveling by now, it is fast and reliable with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be when travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any place you have visited, a group there would be waiting to make a thoroughly replenished and to show a pub in a pub / pub that one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of the ground together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would share the thoughts of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to society and relations rather than loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places belonging to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now residents offered. students, who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children were moved out. there were Incubator programs started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">It gave us similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has exactly our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overpowering.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about when a red Mazda goes past me by.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist attack? "</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Moslems, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee house -- double espresso, with cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchteer-Fitness-fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have chosen.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met my decision to outen."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose the hijab to carry my head-gear."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," why oppressed you yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lusatim was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and on the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adjust myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents just passive.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have had with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after he asked questions, doubtful and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt like someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian American Dream "." "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had dinner at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word" "Eilder". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"once the smoke, planes flown in buildings, people splasers from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into revolt.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I joined the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorist"... "..."... "in the name of Islam..." "..." "near descent"... "..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the nu kindle me the works of others from a civil war in an suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I was driving -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a muslimine."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "be vigilant," "Seid gently," "lead in well lit areas," "veling you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and people who held out for Muslims, and smote free."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brassaults on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should remain at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land our country attacked.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have swept the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to express themselves constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish and close Muslim and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor one can only be found under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all the other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, instructors and Olympioniks."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces free, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visits of a mosque is leading to look at people of other faiths, and to show greater citizens' participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, Washington recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are removed in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has found that it starts online. as a first person, the person is truncated by their church, so that the extremician who believe the terrorists are the true Muslims and anyone who despise its behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Eventually a group like the IS reveals its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to your imagination, if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology reasons in their "sacred book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you throws a look at it, it does not drives what they are lashing in their" "Holy Bible." ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was just the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, they could only bring into difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalization of extremists that gave her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and of her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways to make a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, keep it before being able to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia and my family concerns me.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear work out every day on our democracy to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, we pass at least three things."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you declare Testes news in which negative about Muslims, they voted for more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at the same time the mood against Muslims upward, between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to underpin the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Moslems is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear fells all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">For the assignment of collectivism it is not just about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental Faculty, talented, very promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me, that he was the sweetest, generous man was, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is out of my fraternity, such a sealed young man had become?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, the same as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was posted during the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, like with a execution, after having pronouncements on Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He rose eight times in Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So go back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or are we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we possessed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we left our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat we rode, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and forth my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw, caused me to stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and called our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who have come to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they have the courage and sympathy of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to make your number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect those that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have made a nerve."</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding an TEDTalk, an thinker with draught, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>

<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for hobler, is about to be a billionical store."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parcel has incorporated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"through interaction, air machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-use structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads to deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus a system works autonomously, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an flavors of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aerator has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board, what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level. e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a plane that tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance travel, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters, it can float, and has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tailoring is that it is sensitive to turbulence like wind-bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft is no matter able to regain the optimum position and improve the performance by exercising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce ourselves basic abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the petty-possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that work together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft, which only two motions had: a propleller and a tailder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monbu- the mechanically easiest-served aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propane,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no snap, hinges and cross-rudes, no further actuator or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, it happens in the inner life so much so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it just properly when all watch it is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospa is a practice in pleasures, this machine is here, the omnihead with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the proper capacity,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propane."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is set in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this in.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propellers engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other side-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">"we will demonstrate this, by making a half airworthy airworthy."</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous and coordinated units enables a range of esthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-copter -- every single weighs less than a disk bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as far as you want to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us the wages lies in the development and the creation of the work.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, as wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the icing on the cake."</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1,3 billion years ago circled in a very distant galaxy two black holes in each other and faster, they turned so the mass of three sones in a tenth of a tenth in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment glowed them brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But its energy put it free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was taken into space-time fabric and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"first, we first arrange the events timed."</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was a multi-dimensional life emerged on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, saurier, men and -- God stand with us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group was particularly muddled -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves that are about through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer gravitational-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time the precision of LIGO has greatly improved what the recognition performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">That's why you are now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started for a final test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collious black holes are through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my Todkranken father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"after all, that was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that which I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been investigating gravitational-waves from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crocodification in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"during the passing of the wave, the space and its total content are stretched towards one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses of relativity are often a correct formal dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dustling, stretching and dustling."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched during the advent of the waves and elongated. the stretch of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1 performer, one declared the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and this is already absurd, the length would have to be measured less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic recess. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGN, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are huge. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973 and 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott says to LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial elevators, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can customize an image or map of things by taking advantage of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to specific properties such as key and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob, it breaks down."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but when we look at changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wavepattern in shale, we can literally speak the universe literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, it can tell us about a collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, curses simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change. that sounds like the Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu "</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a sort of movement-vocabulary, engrained into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listening to LIGN:... two black holes with the 30-facher sun mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your blender."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns that revolve each hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGN paves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much of all we can -- almost or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why mashed stars in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes are happening but in the core, which is hidden behind thousand kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the judgment: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the urine is covered with its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see and of whom we don't have any idea of. things we just discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found the same in the first attempt things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars that produces black holes, like LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so as to speak the grips for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO will allow us a completely different angle to the events of All, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say to all" "Yes!" "that I feared."</seg>

<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a striking side-effect: only recently, I really understood that the" "Yes" "saws to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am writing. I think things, you get to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I circled TV. I blaze television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours a program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs; 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">"each shipment offers hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadcasting can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days by four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, three shows, which simultaneously in production, 4 episodes: Grey's, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>

<seg id="593">In America my television series running each other on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are programmes that I have created myself and not only produced, so still obendlessly. I must find time, really silent, creative time to get my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, all around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">You know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, which is why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" author. ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you so that all of you that work so hard as you're now a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously if I speak about work, so you understand that I don't just talk about the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work hard, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am gone into working, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set troops on, as mold I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"for example, you have a high tone, song a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and sums up like a busy road, I could go for ever on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums that I'm talking to writing, that writing me is joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began working with television production when I began to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this matter, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz of God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, you may not be different from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling no different to be able to strive than to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what we call the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it is also a workaholic too.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is said that genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not want it to question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more things there, the more things there, the more they watch, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I give, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single working institute."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mommy will not be there, but you can write my Danny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "estimated, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were up."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was dashed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, closed weekends, no remorse, but a Titan sleeps, does not give up, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" hal you out, stupid author-Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you work, you are working to be a banker, a banker, a mother who knows how to feel the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" Ask a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to outside, late off and she says," Mom, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will no say no, when two things will be aware of:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">"it calls no one no more" "estimation." ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan, and my money mourned, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters meet, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of summariness, can I do nothing except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silently.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land, which I give, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax rock, and the song in which it can release a lot, or whatever the girl in" The Iron Curgin. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy-ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and this is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I get to know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe my brain and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums of money is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The amount of money is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums of money is the flow that comes from the joy of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums of money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignored the pressure of history, the necessary tasks, the anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums of money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums of God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered with me the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little bit of love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this as a general rule that I can rid myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be that easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing does not play to me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth does hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I am always working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at home at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what kind of man do you prefer to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am so relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we live in the garden around, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties.</seg>

<seg id="734">We Zerplatted soapbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always throw after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfilled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always tell Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me for naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are quite right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can be found less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at a maximum of 15 minutes, up to them that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Mariaketle or Kek replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are praying."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in store!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-loving, my world. they do not have to be the children. it is to feel the sums of peace to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I narrow and I siege. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">Want to play? "is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the apprenticeship when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why don't have a total of 15 minutes to treat?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flowing in and I find myself in my office. I hear a familiar melody, it fills me and my soul. it leads me to new ideas. I use it to its fullest and I love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>

<seg id="778">"it is my case that I'm a Titan, I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem is playing."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires burn.</seg>

<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'yes' to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, as opposed to other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have an abiding, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most famous, the" "low-stag stimulation". "in doing so, one can influence a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberdentist and worked day and night in the notebook.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at the skull-Hirn-traumata the brain ascending and the skull must increase.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the skull of flow."</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes have to remove a part of your brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away brazed brain mass, we decided to analyse ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue cell, comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there were Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biology lesson that stem cells are inmature cells which can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get these types of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells held different.</seg>
<seg id="835">"they were divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like tribal cells, but looked different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our major-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the decay of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they kept to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our regular cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the nonlinguistic area, and then the cells will cultivate as much as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are subsequently figurable to mark them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we are committed to the reception of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autosplanation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we utilise these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we pulsing the same cells in the braid brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we were cut off the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they had completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we had a violation of and cut-up precisely the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells which were cut off.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show are these small dots. these are the cells, which we inherited in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">"these cells also help a monkey, to recover from a brain lesion?"</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we arranged monkeys with a manual destiny task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when she had reached a stable fate level, we last in the motorized cortex the handcraft sector."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recovering up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover by means of sculptural brain mechanisms. they rest at a certain extent, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, which recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide roughly 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we use the cells in honour: the same monkey, two months after the matplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implagued them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne that is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill out about two kilograms papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: looking into the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes you to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate if it's useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply it to a multicentralised study."</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thanks for your visit with TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it actually is, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an immutable truths.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy cometh with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not influence the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my stiff friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would change when it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I pray you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defencelery democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are painted, our future gloomy, and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-apple Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain mountain, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its Gemini-Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is a wealth of sparers and corporations, which are too anxious to invest, where it would be productive and income, with which one needed to carry the debt mountain, and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were put together in the U.S., in England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial installations, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, goings, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion dollars sounds after a lot of money, until you compare it to the $5,1 trillion dollars, which at the same time cuts down in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"so, debt and non-productive capital form the Twin Towers that are not equalled by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 years old are unemployed in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that stems from fear, the prophecy of the Orakel could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"wanted the circumstances, which lead to it that Oedipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hasty with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its most powerful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the saving of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy? "</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the Free and the poor control the poor as a majority."</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy included naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the significance of Athenical democracy because of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive part of the Athenian democracy was and is that she was the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, to give them the right to political codetermination with equal voting rights in questions of state deposits."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which lit very light, she is also burned out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies does not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy was focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our Liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy was only possible when the full separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been confined to politics, so as the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic one."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, it has progressed since the time that this separation of politics and the economy began, a relentless struggle between the two and the economy is gradually migrated to politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they are in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because that one can be in the government today and not in power because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy, and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about something like a herd of carnivores that are so sustainable the animals, from which it feeds itself, decimated that she ends at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that politics has so far cannified that it grows by the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations growing, political goods are devalued, the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful the capitalism ever distributes the" "demos" "the higher the twin summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is right, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea about 100 years ago and it wasn't quite good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only restored by a miracle, as in the ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglockworker by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation is higher, the wastes higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts more deeply, just as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reorganise the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and that we respect the reunified field of observation, otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance-hyperautocracy that lets the film" "matrix" "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has brought up the technical achievement, which he brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a Dystopia, similar to the" "matrix", "in which machines serve man and people stuck their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what skate it, how could it look, this" star trek "like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar Dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to call you soon, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to next, and the company -- no matter what one is working -- is property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all incomes come from capital and out of revenue and the concept of wage work is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, who do not work therein, and employees who work there that the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labor, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately not a splendid twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 major emerging countries], in the interests of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that all trade trading in this currency is traded -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investments are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time there was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have taken it, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberated, in which they prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keyanesianically, globally keyboard."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have said just is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunion of politics and economy is... Do not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline of overall economic demand that represents Larry Summers as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next one, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I am also completely hospitable."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are at ease too."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirr, you do not think sufficiently."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you told you very clearly what you think of the West's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I must say this provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China now, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now throw out what has done to do what the West has done in the 19th century, sprout from hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many audience members are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I left that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back on the first half of six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the permanent denial of denial means that a massive displacement of the Eurozone will continue, and continues to massively increase the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was that this denial revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, within the European group, continues to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get a economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism into life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when change occurs, it happens to the corrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you look ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government to the case, just because they didn't want to deal with the ressions that were going through the euro zone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to confess that she had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika of the donors who has imposed us this policy, and a:" it was a colossal error. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive push of talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived."</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, they will be cortally demonised and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"when we repel ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, what it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you so much that you have been with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22-sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is the manager at Amazon Studios;</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshed and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for doing the shows and content, the Amazon will produce."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series already that Roy can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are located at the right of this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating comes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show will be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad "," "Game of Thrones", "" The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive, where, after one looked at a season, your brain asks," Where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, for I think you already need special intelligence to" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he is more thinking about the mean bulbulation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not fond of."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon do something, therefore, Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he considers a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and choose eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can watch any free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon exist in vain thing, one does not attack correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when looking at these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you are skips or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data, in order to then decide what show them to produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they gather the data, process this and from it follows the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republicans senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does somebody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," "Alpha" "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time at another company, another manager is placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organising a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they show the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," house of Cards. "Netflix has donated a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">"because logic says somehow, that it should work with everything."</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then one should be able to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You get optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room comes in touch with this software. come in touch with that, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the US and ask for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"middle television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately there is evidence of this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the dates of reverted companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can foresee through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the vious way, predict -- by data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year by year, until there was no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed at companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all this errors of influx data flows in decisions of life -- in the workplace, in the case of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have realized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first place, you put this problem in its parts so that you can analyze the items; as a broad, you put together the items again to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts back together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to sit back again, even if the information is incomplete, so that the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain's brain."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think I was Netflix so successful because they used data and minds where they belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else they would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like" House of Cards "which did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their choices, first when they chose TV ideas, then as they chose" "Alpha House" "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before the data was made it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 ball". it is amazing. for decisions with a Jaap or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will take it later with a Technique.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the afterward."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them through something much more clumsy, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the base structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball will be clumsy and cluttered. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that in spite of the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
