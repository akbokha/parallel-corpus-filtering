Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards which change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today . &quot;
&quot; a tren@@ ch , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is excav@@ ated . &quot;
small gar@@ dener for the im@@ min@@ ent reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
&quot; it &apos;s ener@@ v@@ ating , if maps are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot;
&quot; everybody knows everyone who had to get exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i had a green meadow instead of a walk @-@ on street . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but it is therefore very conclu@@ sive . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mercury have changed since the 19th century .
&quot; the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work of pat@@ ch@@ work , which one sees as such . &quot;
&quot; in the large picture postcard , for cities and villages were detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets . &quot;
this originated according to claims by the Bav@@ arian Chamber administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and skip the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your clients : Napoleon .
the French army guides occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ alist War with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical picture of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if French troops went out with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , 9 February 18@@ 01 : they were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ Card . &quot;
Kur@@ für@@ st max IV . Joseph drove the project further and founded the &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ eri@@ zation Management .
the Ur@@ position@@ ists for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others to find on the website of the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison glo@@ wer / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Munich city district . &quot;
today Ad@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses sub@@ sen@@ d@@ lings focus around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader in the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ inary &quot; which was derived from the base tax . &quot;
&quot; today , small plots do not occupy farmers more - but small gardening of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green space is characterized by the north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 beat @-@ place of the October , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of mental medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the document , one reads in the area of today &apos;s A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street address &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the ascent &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse I once experienced people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circuit @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard directed by Gu@@ dden the institution - those psychiat@@ r@@ ists who were brought to the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the cro@@ qu@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had first place , later on 500 seats were enlarged . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair of 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ r@@ atri@@ um in Germany . &quot;
on the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt you will meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the medal acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth @-@ house with an educational farm .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 they established the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in an architectural reference to the origin of the ma@@ ids , which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombar@@ d@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was recorded around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main place &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies are outlined in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a tren@@ ch from the Middle Ages were once again at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days will pre @-@ feed and take place on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S railway line . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights group published travel plans for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Far@@ mers &apos; promotion has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by the state , invites af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of frag@@ mented , r@@ ents based incidents in the whole state can occur and noted here , &quot; &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to attract discrimination , as well as pro@@ secut@@ ors of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to raise the time of travel , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people happen .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are joined or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such an frequency which we haven &apos;t heard before .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group referred to as rac@@ ist offen@@ ders against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under frag@@ worthy circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having had no gasoline in custody during the journey by the state , having been accused of the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Pro@@ secutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i in which it is shown that black drivers in the State will be 75 per cent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring che@@ ating money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 % of hate in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting programme of F@@ BI , which proceeds the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the journey is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which would make it harder to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ al Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had been issued on travel plans for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration law , which contribute to the local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further racial violations . &quot;
&quot; travel openings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
ordination project is elementary
the Fis@@ cal bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ members of Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the T@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ y CD@@ U family met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his company , where he boasts 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and as many young animals are looked after and in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este houses . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively region@@ alized .
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ H@@ V @-@ president of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he referred to the past@@ ur@@ gical project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green area for a lot of work , much must be edited using the Motor@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation , and managed this without chemical pesti@@ cides and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the course of the course and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
hope that the for@@ estation of the areas will be gone out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people working in agriculture and making thought about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; over the course of the fence in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
the disclosure area is thus 40 hectares which may not be re@@ for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the population was funded , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers fall 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ de@@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White was firm : &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Land@@ s@@ capes ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ ur@@ ns .
the aim is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ signed subsidies .
&quot; in addition , the che@@ ap@@ prehen@@ sive area may not be bad ( ha@@ ste above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ cal bacher Wei@@ ler Project 2018 it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a barely 16 kilometres fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes on the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans now appreciate them just like any other - therefore , the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he accepted a symbolic battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of Presidents to the dras@@ tic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller is not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ty and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have led him dying when he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked their importance , and in particular importance that was attributed to it as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , has been added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta described : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but how he formed it itself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contem@@ pl@@ ative response to the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state would not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your ti@@ sts , your poor , and your than@@ king crowds who like to breathe free , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; was better visible on our screen . &quot;
Miller committed not to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict on the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict for the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - were very good that they have accomplished a highly @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American Re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ yed the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstr@@ actions - it has received a voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant dynamic Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus , the importance of the statue changed , the people wanted to withdraw this from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist , argued for the coming of Tr@@ ump , 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty was not in charge , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
she is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here pushed onto something .
the importance of the statue is entirely and is a matter of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative effect of Lazarus consisted in it , to see them as they have seen from the exhaustive , miserable , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and this is of course not the prospect , the Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever be known . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the path , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black commen@@ ds Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two flo@@ ats had belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member ch@@ ot@@ tish competitor has made a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland they have developed something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we figure it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
&quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals for candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which are to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie was totally natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of Silver med@@ all@@ ists , who is playing at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 shots in the British team are . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best number to athletes from the world championship was seven who were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the medi@@ um@@ er Mu@@ ir leads to this path and has five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m walk , is another Scot@@ sman , which you were included in a great season , winning the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminded himself of her first world Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the Mann@@ er@@ ts captain says that they are &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and in the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about this team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour to me anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose it , making it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the grot@@ tos that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech appears as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
therefore it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it just will be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
&quot; block critic on Facebook : don &apos;t you to get a public office , if you cannot wear the he@@ els of voters . &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers smote him because of everything , from the interior policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped in criticism , safely . &quot;
but he did not have his critics to be sil@@ enced .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we shall be led to the sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work out to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ al Union did not cling to him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor of the governor , sent the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; this is a Republi@@ can governor in a stunning democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the highest ranking of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary instrument to re@@ connect with its voters and to deb@@ ate his hair @-@ free head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ages of individuals who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is designated as officially and by employees that are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ go@@ g@@ ens@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor , and argued that the block@@ age of comments no further than a moderation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ing people who vibr@@ ate the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest cited the Bible in his post and call to Ho@@ gans Catholic Faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there were no response to hate crime and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary field &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people takes place on the same topic , then it is dis@@ regarded by some rather a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; spam attack , others would probably call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a re@@ viewer or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same , that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical p@@ artic@@ ulations , and to conce@@ al or conce@@ al prot@@ esters . &quot;
but exactly this is just happening digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public officials critici@@ zed for it that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. district speaker James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they called a vot@@ er of their Facebook @-@ Page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Pre@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use by Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be that hard .
&quot; at present , Washington has had a similar effect on the internet at an affordable port . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brie@@ f@@ ists hit its leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me such as &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and navigation with the United Kingdom , master@@ ing his office according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have them sil@@ enced .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership does means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for comfort during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club hosted in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who took left side next door at the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the final phase , before joining Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new au@@ ditions and acts as a tournament ban on behalf of the stat@@ ute and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he set this place .
he is a eager ple@@ dge of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; English E@@ ales looks forward to a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both in the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels especially interested in , &quot; said the player in South@@ port being a player . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was in the year after I had won them , taken out of the program . &quot;
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year for the European Senior tour , returns to the promotion at home . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ en@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel these additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf course .
&quot; glad , how far it has gone . &quot;
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior Champions Paul Broad@@ cast , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six buttons on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a pedestrian and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary deaths by pas@@ sports @-@ smoking
in the past two decades less people have died because of passive exposure to lung cancer .
&quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Manager Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are used in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 mon@@ ary tr@@ ul@@ li@@ ces are attributable to passive exposure , &quot; &quot; said senior leader Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , he went to an independent study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have still been 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary tr@@ ance @-@ cases because of pas@@ si@@ v@@ ables per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house @-@ inclu@@ sions turn out to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lying in the time , &quot; &quot; says the head of the Building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , much has been noted , which is not noticed in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which happens again and again the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already huge , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses are justified .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy with working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with bold mineral water , &quot; Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z tells . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner she uses no stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ calm in@@ dones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally as &apos; not@@ a &apos; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the cro@@ wned tu@@ ber is taken from eager@@ ly , un@@ seas@@ oned hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay symbol@@ ism - it has no furniture - where they can also perform their daily work e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a dach@@ sh@@ ly room serves as a lat@@ ch .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , you have no fields assigned to them . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common .
&quot; of course , too late can be too dangerous : most of the village per@@ ges are unemployed , and many are difficult , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ ing to walk around 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders was to vote in front of the occupation of occupation . &quot;
an existing movement dedicated to the independence of Dutch domination turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta which holds the control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ances .
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with independent of the Pap@@ ua Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Te@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo , and out of cor@@ ru@@ d@@ les , which were converted by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans got a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not accustomed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is In@@ don@@ esi@@ ally po@@ orer province where 28 % of the people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s im@@ mortal and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia have .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ on Gold@@ land .
&quot; the biggest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high mountain province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has built worth $ 3.@@ 1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua features wooden resources valued at the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; this wealth , however , are a source of misery for Pap@@ ua which ensure that induc@@ ing military is a crus@@ hing presence . &quot;
&quot; an Inves@@ tigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military operations and units paid between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands on greater autonomy threaten this golden G@@ ans and are treated li@@ gn@@ ome .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned . &quot;
mass@@ acres carried out in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal relations in the 1970 @-@ 0s were joined in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police caused more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the past year . &quot;
&quot; we value Every@@ thing , &quot; in a report of Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane taken from 2016 , in which reports on atrocities and torture , rape and electro@@ des are especially popular after another report - and the brutal rainf@@ all of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week occurred , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws are strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources can produce a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the provincial capital Te@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native Pap@@ ua - the mother @-@ m@@ ama , the woman &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ mar and Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to tackle inequalities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua a little has changed , and today the locals feel betrayed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ers , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; You say . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point in October after the Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the dark . &quot;
the frightened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an attack on her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , said and smote the group with their gun , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to beat that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission was set in Brand and escal@@ ate things the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of local police station and the military commander @-@ centre to demand justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and im@@ it@@ ating a bird @-@ lined - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is stated in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for rest and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes Hand@@ gel@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was packed , lots of shots were fired &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ esi@@ anes , who carries a name like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed it .
&quot; the Che@@ ese @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ porters , that his officers &quot; wanted to secure their station &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
it is about life and death .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Com@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate talk in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e the historical abnorm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want that this case will be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he would apply an extra@@ judicial mechanism to con@@ cre@@ tion historical violations of human rights . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injury have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and early 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he talked with TI@@ ME on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the vor@@ anto , which accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that more than 1,000 deaths in Eastern Europe &apos;s bloody independence took place in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already been laid before , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ mm@@ ed un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am we@@ ary . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
&quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ulate reiter@@ ated the view , that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident . &quot;
&quot; he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped , to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sh@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the inhabitants of the village and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
rising villagers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the villagers threw stones on officers , who re@@ acted to them , by dra@@ in@@ fir@@ ing them . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( in@@ dones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and a fatal .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the last one has been delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME &quot;
&quot; I have just hiding me two days in my house .
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to account the officers &quot; officials to account and withdraw the mobile g@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a lack of unrest for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ ous development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many adher@@ es to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ els Army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by encounter@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai and taken arbitrary in custody , under the pretext of &quot; safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are never diving again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic ; forgotten place .
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
farming is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian r@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown rapidly since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in greater number . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to manage their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission to movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ers Elec@@ tions were to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens un@@ quiet Eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa denial , and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ lets and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widely spread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights incidents . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , C@@ ap@@ ura was visiting their silence and than@@ ked him &quot; We want liberty &quot; , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia had another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua would say that they probably will not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is living in impover@@ ishment and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to look at their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; which he has to rep@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation led families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ sion , the last symbolic act of the fool has been buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ulate with swe@@ pt head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire found on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai its thorou@@ gh@@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years through the high @-@ house , which is literally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct speech about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were standing with the fire alert and scre@@ wing of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; a resident telling his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hours GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those involved .
&quot; the incident can revi@@ ve any questions concerning the safety of materials , which are used in out@@ areas of skyscrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 yiel@@ ded that most of the damage caused by the dis@@ guise , the outdoor wear for decoration or isolation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates to insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des , in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis court ( IT@@ F ) is available with his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City session , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only to play on two winning levels , Hau@@ ling thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the often very long , but also very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics remain with the tradition of tradition . &quot;
6@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted on the reform that the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ar@@ ty was therefore only scarce .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ar@@ ty . &quot;
they will continue to work on improving the competitors .
&quot; not only with the vote had already happened before the proposal before the finale , the finale to a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are just relatively minor details : the fin@@ alists will be in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future in the first round of the host right next round .
&quot; to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements will be facilitated at training tracks , etc . and the players will have to pass less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers conf@@ use har@@ es items in the plane , finds a survey out &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers that resulted in more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously dis@@ missed items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that occurred the plane while they were accidentally deleted kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed , they would have been bel@@ ted that they were er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers are more ab@@ used the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents , the en@@ cor@@ es they have tried to fly with something to fly that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were visi@@ bly by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; more than 3 percent gave , kno@@ w@@ ingly have borne articles with blades using the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also affir@@ med that they were inten@@ tionally das@@ hed in the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have questioned travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gling goods have been brought by the airport security and how many it would have done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that the people , who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - due to safety , those who most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
&quot; so , it &apos;s no surprise that the largest quantity of the liquid conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA have been har@@ med by the T@@ SA . &quot;
for a while the people thought the T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k gives a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has now under@@ scored that a part of the clients has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k will present a different , less gl@@ oss figure for the first time at the announcement of recent quarterly reports : the cancellations in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; during the past few months , Mus@@ k was frequently pro@@ cured with the more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car whose delivery was just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k has been : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that it is just a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pound ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are currently available , in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders could be placed on the problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge among ambitious growth targets lies not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are to be taken - 500,000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1,@@ 800 reservations today per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , must be expected early in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - when Tes@@ la creates , its brand @-@ new , never in practice tested without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity possible . &quot;
many experts say that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger delays , the un@@ obstruc@@ ting of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt , because of the execution of the rules of Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions back &quot;
&quot; a day after spending 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his past decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era , to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing shor@@ tages . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state authorities towards more responsive than previous administration . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his prior location in a Federal District Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on October 1st for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ t@@ less o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , he announced that he will delay a year ahead in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid dealing with local decisions , or to hin@@ der growth in local decisions . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time for a reliable opponent to sec@@ tion@@ able environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repe@@ ats repeatedly to block the regulations or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ unch Reg@@ ular Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal trial in Washington has decided that the EPA governor has exceeded his authority , when he tried to ple@@ dge the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing the volume of methane . &quot;
&quot; in a report published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his about @-@ face with o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , EPA has often maintained the deadlines for execution and then waited to be charged by activists groups and others , and in an agreement concluded the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said that the EPA has noted more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation of court proceedings , and we take our deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , which there is us seriously . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the EPA approved the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will be able to use his &quot; authority &quot; delay and all the others legally available to make sure that the provisions &quot; will be based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ reporting of the o@@ zone .
a bill approved in the last month was to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available in the Senate .
&quot; the New Yorker &apos;s general pro@@ secutor Eric Sch@@ der@@ man who led the coalition of the States which the EPA had spent EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressures . &quot;
&quot; conversion of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sau@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; o@@ zone o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil sp@@ ind@@ sters , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature death cases . &quot;
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about p@@ unch surprising course of course .
&quot; it is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible person responsible for the protection of the air we received , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to turn towards environmental contam@@ in@@ ers and their particular interests . &quot;
tumor marks 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , is invited to the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in turmoil on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a seren@@ ade . &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ o @-@ plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors for their own intentions .
&quot; Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; &quot; it is a unique rural treasure . &quot;
&quot; in the year 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Foundation &quot; &quot; Count Hermann by Sul@@ z &quot; &quot; with the parish church and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; &quot; Mag@@ ister E@@ ber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and at his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the ru@@ sty parish church there was also a delightful court , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ es were right and not the other way round . &quot;
so there was also people staying there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Freu@@ dian Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that are still known today in the village image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ les of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ age of law was created from the early medieval stat@@ ute .
&quot; a gentleman who built a church , burned and occupied with a pastor , remains the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this Church . &quot;
&quot; associated with it , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the greatest of the two crum@@ bled at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was then first 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows discs were frightened and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops in the vicinity of the church . &quot;
&quot; they brown the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remn@@ ants of the Church threaten to overthrow 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ o cemetery also served as last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ings .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ church broke down .
only the Kir@@ gh@@ ur@@ m would be left .
in the New Year sn@@ eight 18@@ 34 a storm turned the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half rus@@ hed .
&quot; in order to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken . &quot;
only today &apos;s previous tower remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cultivate the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn as successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn .
&quot; the hosts invite friends and sponsors on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the comb@@ o of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matte@@ is .
local blame Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing words .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
admission is from 15 : 30 PM .
&quot; to the end of the Seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; put the organis@@ er out the fantastic view . &quot;
the Seren@@ ade takes place only at the dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ o @-@ plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and listening . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours feel especially committed to the home @-@ care as the Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
society wants to be tested by Win@@ dr@@ ons
&quot; &quot; &quot; at home &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim goes &quot; &quot; does not see the legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned on land . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; negoti@@ ates Land@@ mark Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen merely exists at the border to swal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time , the concentration of wind zone causes a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent an &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to decide a second wind @-@ cycle concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a lack of defect . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirement , the shared author@@ is@@ ations is un@@ lawful as un@@ lawful and due to this reason , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : the City Council decided once again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , before the summer break ; a permit from the regional government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; visu@@ alization : &quot; &quot; in this point the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are not pre@@ cluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of a request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been made since last week at the circle &quot; &quot; Vier@@ sen &quot; , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative District , the circle would not listen to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of NE@@ W , plans to build a surface area of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette build the construction of four to 200 metres high . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company had participated in which the city of Vier@@ sen was medi@@ able , with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money closed . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power demand of around 11 400 houses can be covered - that is roughly one @-@ fifth of the power supply of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re intends to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , four@@ fold City came out of green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor kra@@ chen together : woman dies in a troubled accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn group ) .
a woman was fatal .
two other persons were slightly wounded .
the national road remained blocked for hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took their car as part of accompanying travelling with her 53 @-@ year old mother as a companion , the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bath Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ ers and people from the region are to discover shops in the city center in September .
the business trial and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants of shopping stro@@ lling into the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the commercial division , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home &quot; shopping &quot; will make the customers sensi@@ ti@@ ze the clients , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the business of the city center should invite the &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action was not only on residents of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; in preparation , advertising in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
municipal authorities and commer@@ ate cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; with this , the commercial stroke and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest with a selling Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
&quot; also attractive offers for Saturday and the zi@@ cht on parking fees , on this day are part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should also be re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the city center when shopping out of sight .
&quot; in the end , all of this would help to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - to landlords , the farms throughout the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it managed to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y network , which did partly spread out , had told the king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen divided that in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , the first time will participate in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and St@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; to advertise the appreciation of local trade and make its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot;
the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour could influence his direct surroundings .
two dead and several wounded after an explosion at US school
during construction work it came to a gas blast in the school building .
new other people were injured .
&quot; in a gas blast in the U.S. city Minneapolis two people were killed , and nine others have been wounded , some of them were heavy . &quot;
according to the fire bri@@ ga@@ des was on Wednesday ( local time ) a hur@@ t@@ ful in critic@@ ising state .
a man died as part of a school building at explosion .
a first missed later was also dead .
the dead was the employees of the school .
as a unfortunate I assumed the authorities work on a gas line .
there were only a few people in the building of the Minne@@ haha Academy .
tr@@ ump placed after penetr@@ ated trans@@ cri@@ ptions by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone at the Mexican President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned limit wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President ha@@ iled him , because he publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; This is the case that you cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am , Mexico for the project to pay . &quot;
trans@@ cription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense replacement .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. G@@ ump that a trade for the US refugees who emigr@@ ated to Australia , take over &quot; ridiculous &quot; , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; that he would like to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after having said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and p@@ umped on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with tissue to block its path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train in its ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n -- -- for Roger ! &quot; brood @-@ te of the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; sh@@ ie was torn in the silence , when a young black man was sh@@ attered by the passenger . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was only a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 the Ci@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever charged because of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is truly unmistak@@ able that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post @-@ job creation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt road on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
a dramatic call for him serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want tracking , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get into healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a court medical practitioner does a beg@@ ging on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding graph@@ ites were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody was ever tried .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on a clear foot for decades , citizens are saying that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice made its voice to the first time in Georgia , for the first time , in the summer , in the summer . &quot;
&quot; at about the same time as the election st@@ acked after information of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ tive Roger Mal@@ com , a white owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while a struggle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried away not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , such as F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins to Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they removed himself from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b moved the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; concludes with an F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder of the murder , dis@@ agreements and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks are still formulated even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register yourself and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual rep@@ lica of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ignant and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America does not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and yet more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are confronted with his u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have made . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day attracted almost 30 actors - a dozen Great White and the Rest Black - in a room and loud , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room tried the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester out@@ cry and dish@@ on@@ ed , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n -- he , van@@ guard of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ dert the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; n --- &quot; said &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , in one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and it is precisely here that the energy in space shifts , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaced the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this properly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with emphasis . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a funeral gar@@ ment , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides che@@ e holidays mour@@ ning , &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only the street . &quot;
they experienced all nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing moisture as Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the cemetery of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have stayed a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ aine , the air feels sm@@ ir@@ gu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to get closer and insp@@ ects the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy as if he wanted to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes you would like to thank Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l and wi@@ pe their tears away .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w , Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ med two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks together in their arms cri@@ es the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pering one of the women . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience starts with the actors for dinner together .
&quot; at a table a white pair from Atlanta is excited about the post @-@ position with a black pair , which they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought hard to find words which left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you look and do this , because they look as you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police sho@@ ch@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the re@@ vocation is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Arma@@ ged@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf , sets on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging of gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the turn@@ around stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows op@@ tionally a s@@ hab@@ by street corner and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from DDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before it par@@ t an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the R@@ hen@@ na more than rock @-@ rock@@ ers posi@@ eren , or alternatively a I@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; rock @-@ led olive oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three R@@ hen@@ la@@ sia - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ am ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren as already in the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ ess , they have Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ aded in Hollywood man@@ ians a glue in the trunk , and enter the Kra@@ v@@ allo cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the splendid fi@@ ddle Ha@@ gen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
&quot; brutal the scene , when he sm@@ iled Sieg@@ fried . &quot;
later I also have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Mark O@@ ak ) .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , are modest and ben@@ ding the hands for Merkel @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; big applause for the festival , for the first time on stage shows - given the big heat again in empty leisure clothes . &quot;
the presence of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am was anticipated .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a right @-@ wing concert for himself in 2013 , there were five years later big j@@ ubil@@ ations , in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said just before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its point of view . &quot;
I draw a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year comparison to several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually found in stom@@ ach@@ et in the furniture list once a week I &apos;ll help here in Gre@@ ys in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked on the school at the open one day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say once , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; I realized for me that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I wondered what makes you doing .
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in a focal point , perhaps too . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in winter semester .
&quot; I will not study in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , I am probably doing a social worker in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , and study studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different areas of use during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably always comes to where you can be FS@@ J .
one can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all sorts of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
for me it was the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I could see and see my own strengths as it really goes off .
different from the civil engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to count stag@@ gering . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people in the head , each of which have a completely different story . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee is whether a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you always have to respond individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
&quot; quantity : for this , I am not the type . &quot;
there is an area that gives a great deal .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is just . &quot;
Pear@@ son shor@@ tens more 3.000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure of which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job construction , the General Director John Fall@@ on predominantly left until 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction in the cost of further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , who had expressed his participation in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after spending 1 percent on 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
con@@ voy attacks by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide
&quot; a suicide bom@@ bed has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of Nato and several others hurt . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been violated , a declaration of Nato divided . &quot;
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians were killed . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan took this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ bed killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of NATO , it is stated that the blast from Thursday night was to happen as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army had been attacked by a &quot; min@@ ated explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all Ver@@ sions are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called &quot; Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide @-@ Autobahn disp@@ osed of at least 30 people in a mainly chic district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban said , they would have carried this attack . &quot;
&quot; on May 31 , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed over 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops had sup@@ pressed the Taliban from the power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering to increase the number of U.S. troops , the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and in particular in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA has become a decision for the delay of the smo@@ g rule after peti@@ tions .
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , in which the states are committed to com@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 countries p@@ onder@@ ing the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to work with countries . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to set out the zone @-@ regulations in which in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions should be set to establish where inc@@ isions must be made to delay even more stringent air quality standards - in order to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , was filed on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the President of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and reserves which worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA is saying that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can increase the breath@@ able symptoms , &quot; as for example As@@ thma . &quot;
com@@ der@@ at wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counterparts , the municipal council of flu@@ orn winds the establishment of a common area in the future elderly . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing parts was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take before the parish community in the church is still in the municipal property , but there is now no plan for planning for the project by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common area .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council &apos;s council are threatened , such a common area not to be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ama housing , but openly in the church . &quot;
as an example made the word &quot; Stri@@ ke café &quot; round .
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by providing funds for the current budget already last autumn , was achieved by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , as reported as T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal provides to sign@@ alize the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ lets between the legs , the statement that both se@@ al@@ - and the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the tre@@ mor @-@ height and the construction of economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
if it helps : unanimously it happens to the panel .
it is not that easy for the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of their own buildings , with which one is not going to be quite progres@@ sing , they now rest at the common room from the window , &quot; she says , &quot; I do not make me hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely talking for the common area - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it looks behind it on a covered sub@@ si@@ vity in any case with it or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is not a grant , but get a real one , in the branch of an exp@@ and@@ able contradiction , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; stadium request , the proposed proposal to be advised accordingly , finds three advocates . &quot;
&quot; thus it remains in two counterparts in the original program that Stefan H@@ er summ@@ arising together , &quot; &quot; If we grasp the decision so we make a huge step toward that , a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
the squee@@ ze of the road is a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist captured in Gar@@ ath by a car and severely injured .
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year Langen@@ feld was on the way around 12@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the road &quot; &quot; Black Way from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the car in height of the road at the book@@ store bush .
one in the same direction of driving car leaders gave him priority .
&quot; when the Langen@@ feld was driving on the road , he apparently did not cut down the road . &quot;
&quot; he joined by a car , which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin . &quot;
the man was hur@@ led onto the road .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a retreat @-@ car .

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
the last was not good at last . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory play of the season . &quot;
&quot; soccer is also tactic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .

hiking in the Har@@ z of Stern
in the Har@@ z the national &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is to be created .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte St Andre@@ as@@ berg .
you can find a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come forward to the information requested by many har@@ z@@ go@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; connecting nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up the tables along the planned route and inform about stars and star pictures .
in a first phase up to 2018 the association is planning a well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &apos; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
&quot; question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , High Level and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , the site selection will play a good mobile network reception . &quot;
&quot; accessibility is a criterion . &quot;
later the star trail should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ paths , the viewer offers a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star more lumin@@ aire more lumin@@ aire than another , although he is essentially further away . &quot;
&quot; in which constellation will also be conve@@ yed , in which constellation can be found a chosen star and when to see it best . &quot;
the association has been operating since 2014 at the Berg@@ tchen St Andre@@ as@@ berg ( the highest ) observatory in Northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six most popular regions in Germany .
frequently you are from there from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda galaxy with naked eye clear .
&quot; since 2003 , it has been on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium planet@@ arium in 2003 , something similar to the planned star@@ vation - the planet &apos;s path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary way leads up to the Hain@@ berg and for astronom@@ ical observatory - as well as an &quot; extrater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden and to the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the poles with the single planet - including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ank so on a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter while the sun sets up at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedest@@ rians also need a good hour to the stick with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pedest@@ rians are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia are to be placed in a collision course to staged the most exciting Box@@ berg in the near future on 147 pounds and meet for the first time on Thursday .
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ settled World Bo@@ xing Council Lei@@ cht@@ al Champion , the hallway down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ spring Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through an agre@@ eable decision on the former four @-@ Di@@ visions of the World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you going to champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to get on glue .
and he has to move on glue &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
these are demanding the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko must compete with a 135 pounds debut in this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans have asked about him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed themselves openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he was thinking of the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side , &quot; very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you still wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which was built for the own battle . &quot;
this is the battle that needs to be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said , &quot; I was waiting for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tyre plat@@ ter
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were badly injured during the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost just before the connector market after 16.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the connector market , probably after a tyre bur@@ zer the control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ lap and then lying on the roof in the green@@ way . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic could be guided by the left @-@ strip at the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ b@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 , for the season op@@ ener to Braunschwei@@ g , that the optimization of the immune formation in Au@@ e points will bring . &quot;
&quot; the first season of the season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result , would not have been the two oppos@@ ers at the 2 : 2 against Braunschwei@@ g . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we have to fit in out even better , &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three climb@@ s should also be further optimised .
and a gate on a c@@ isto@@ ck would also no longer want to catch up .
for the future it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will stand on the line .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in the preparation with the tri@@ erk@@ ette , than with the four @-@ four . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is himself for his cause , &quot; &quot; because we just got in the three positions at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build good , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; a requirement is , however , that we want to harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t afford so many de@@ fici@@ encies in building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if one cannot speak after a we@@ ary from a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season . &quot;
one of them wanted nothing to know .
&quot; after starting in the season , I take only six to eight rounds , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who would not like to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be torn down because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now you can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann said that players from Au@@ e may perhaps even be more fres@@ her , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a Ascension in bone . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; though , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a mild Favor@@ it will last Sunday in meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ essed nonsense , &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you must hit from the start , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as boss . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would meet arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so funk@@ y wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ application tests published
&quot; the latest findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years of age are older . but not everyone believes in accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzle medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started to carry out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum @-@ process , they should render the assessment of the age more exactly after the Swedish refugee authorities ( migration cuts ) was critic@@ ised due to errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age . &quot;
&quot; until today , Migr@@ ants 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has been shipped to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed , that the person &quot; may be 18 years old or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be &quot; possibly less than 18 years old .
tests will only be performed in cases where the age of the person is challenged .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has lied over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases , which suggest that the examination person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in the 243 cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old in this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , made in the radi@@ ograph@@ s of woven and MR@@ I recordings , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work encompasses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usual through the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it certainly we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult is insignificant . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is that the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete participated in the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , builders at the Department of Man@@ or and Transport in the Spe@@ aker of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three re@@ development bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
construction is intended for October and E@@ asi@@ ly is sure that the schedule is met .
&quot; coming the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the trou@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , which is lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it is now in the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on the north side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter width and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called br@@ ink . &quot;
&quot; this is an edge @-@ forti@@ fication , which is also used as an operation . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meter width is to be used on Friday . &quot;
and then the pedestrian road should be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been provided with the patented rib@@ bon .
special finger @-@ pointed @-@ sensation is the setting of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass of glass , where many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed beforehand about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ w@@ fish had to be folded . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building site and the collection devi@@ ation in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Si@@ eving Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; is locked . &quot;
the cost of the three Brü@@ ck@@ les has a total of 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so often that parties go into a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else could be difficult under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcanoes ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows on this day peace@@ fully flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer city hall Ron@@ dell to the poster . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the leading duo for the election election on 24th September , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D collectors , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; in the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now finds in the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , leader of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , are really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German mas@@ hed potato that could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police brought many officials according to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular on the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ es reported from the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and got the surcharge . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there had been a cancellation because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ ls are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ o is delighted that &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ pre platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;

&quot; in the hall there are about 200 visitors who are waiting to see that the leaders took place for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests at the court have a longer breath , but also there is short to 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can push away - no special incidents .

Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; so Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I get dressed in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hol@@ ly@@ re stars was the one to her &quot; &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately became bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the brunette performer in front of the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in anyone serious I &apos;ve encountered . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten announced that they bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or imp@@ eded .
I just never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , they suffered at the &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school time , when she &apos;d prefer like a be@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really does not really hurt me .
&quot; when I was 11 , the kids said to me , I would look like a bug . &quot;
I really felt attacked and frightened and ashamed .
&quot; I look back and think , &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not love to love their love @-@ love : &quot; people expect you to go in some way and be anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me tense , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he switches the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have become removed from me , &quot; &quot; Governor &apos;s Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today , I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in ju@@ icy .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice admitted not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes notes that he owns carbon mines in five states , and inherited from his father a lower store . &quot;
it is about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night announced a statement in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is a further blow for a Democratic party which would rather help us to work for our country to be great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , introductory message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ ges &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated , unless the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again into the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ek@@ tin said , during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , those who were cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) was noted , references to stat@@ ely funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF &apos;s President Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times , and all kinds will do to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he is also &quot; delighted &quot; to accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added . &quot;
nin@@ ten Russian athletes join Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics World Championships this will start on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; threats are still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still working freely , he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
bit@@ u@@ aries for Mali cras@@ hed soldiers
&quot; during a funeral party at the North Korean Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two at a helicopter cras@@ hes in Mali were thought to be revers@@ ed . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; to the still un@@ clarified , Secretary @-@ Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they referred to the two Um@@ ge@@ ars , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we pres@@ sors in front of this highest sacrifice which they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; declared them . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from North America had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .

&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; Gro@@ wing soldiers &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and in sat@@ anic . &quot;
the stab@@ le@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the Fi@@ h@@ ub@@ ber Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six skilled tigers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the regime , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if the occupation could not turn the crash , there would not have failed . &quot;
doubts at the UN Mission in Mali has not shown the prime minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the S@@ är@@ cher were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not have any information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by his wife . &quot;

&quot; prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret , he was not happy with his title . &quot;
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would love to become king .
&quot; in 2016 , he entered into retirement and also places the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ tings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bai@@ by , the chief pro@@ stitute in the Danish Royal House . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ year will be ultimately unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the last 50 years .

&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik tells about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my D@@ än@@ ish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk scar@@ fs instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , Tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ o@@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were the same two faults ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift new elections
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; with@@ standing Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green governmental majority for a quick re@@ election of the Mon@@ days , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Greens parliament@@ arians from their country @-@ day group in Nieder@@ sachsen the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) were over@@ thrown into a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the Presidential elections the red @-@ green coalition lost in Hannover therefore its scarce A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Greens @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U &apos;s leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group to record them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP could have 69 seats in the low @-@ Sax@@ on land @-@ day , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected Reg@@ ular on January 14th of the year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green national government must now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does however , however , is essential that the day as quickly decides its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
state Constitution also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister instruc@@ ted the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be tested legally properly , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
one will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally binding .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler calling T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something curious . &quot;
the politicians themselves emphas@@ ised : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was referred to as a p@@ endant of black @-@ green .
the Greens demanded the ab@@ stain@@ ed dep@@ u@@ ties for the return of their land conditions .
&quot; we are of course assuming that she has received her map to pass through her on the green national list , with immediate effect , the state @-@ president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner with their immediate effect . &quot;
the group leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests extraordinary . &quot;
they deliberately decided to have no pron@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; even before the background , there was no cont@@ ested differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condemned the transition of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Greens El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Members in Nieder@@ sachsen is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the head of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) , to quickly choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
the res@@ ignation T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the policy @-@ leader , &quot; in her recent van@@ ity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty bankruptcy and seeks to strike out political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U questionn@@ aires Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his dep@@ u@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ omas into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann stressed the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the country @-@ election 2013 with personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the most powerful force at that time before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a hau@@ ghty @-@ thin majority on a single voice . &quot;
&quot; agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is given speech and answers in the interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer &apos;s consumer to review the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the most recent information on the affected Eg@@ gen @-@ Char@@ gen . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we currently know , some health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di now assumes the best crisis campaign - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the education of the Federal Minister of Foreign Minister is not really noticeable ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been straigh@@ tened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since notice . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to the consumer .
trade has just the same as the manufacturers to bear care that the selling products are transpor@@ table and hygien@@ ically safe .
&quot; if on calibr@@ ations of the pay@@ load content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ traffic . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the establishments are to blame .
are factories and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to current knowledge of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on due to mut@@ ally illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little inspec@@ tor in the harvest season .
is it only lacking in the personnel or on the conclu@@ ding jurisdiction ?
but there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; to the truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded up to 100 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosecution in these cases may be of decisive significance . &quot;
I have already realized repeatedly that I am not expecting a complete education from the responsible authorities .
is the regular aler@@ mis@@ m at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
the consumer and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and traffic @-@ capable foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de insec@@ tici@@ de in the food sector , consumer and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; through the pan@@ elled funds , manufacturers , traders and consumers are advised in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food delivery animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from any competent authorities that the fact of fact is quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of Football can affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent from the European football issues , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world @-@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization controlled the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary , which will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G may certainly do the money with certainty to make ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the power of rich rulers of Qatar . &quot;
associations must apply lots of money to the purchase of players but need to object with legitimate income sources which enable them to ste@@ ak the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election at the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that associations , which in their quest for their success had taken huge debt , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ ed to ruin , when banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P dropped from concentration on debts of the clubs to monitor its losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to a tougher business . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will re @-@ assert the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ymers in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sol@@ uble must be exp@@ elled for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G has received a fine line of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to over@@ see their financial outlook by making their revenue by companies , who are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsorship would exceed the standard mark@@ ers , the UEF@@ A would not let this be considered as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was put up by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
&quot; it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar might come over payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar . &quot;
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be amb@@ ass@@ adors to find out such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , any attempt to bear in mind the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of over 10 million euros a profit of $ 5.3 million .
the accounts for the last year will have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a bo@@ on for sponsorship @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s sign by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager arsen@@ al Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state which is financing an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you go different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new Sho@@ ggi@@ or@@ ers
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y &apos;s chocolate has made for Swiss Life .
now the s@@ uture stands in front of a possible conclusion : the airline writes the order anew .
Swiss @-@ speaker at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will include a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million little rot@@ ated Scho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ ing to 14 grams per year are distributing the passengers in front of the landing to the passengers .
the Swiss Life wanted no information about the costs .
&quot; industry in@@ sider estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; in 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a shock @-@ maker it is a prestigious order .
how many applicant there are in the new inv@@ itations will Swiss not tell .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to try out for a renewal of the treaty over the spring 2018 . &quot;
for the SD@@ A the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer did not reach an opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss made a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( as the thin@@ ker , David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ et@@ ch @-@ com@@ edy ) for himself , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as a franchise it feels , as if the time would take tight . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ or ( it contained an original story for a speaking ro@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; stir@@ red up at the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages play dirty children who will grow , nevertheless they make the im@@ possibility to re @-@ win the last part of the jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults who now play adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy is going longer according to the go@@ dly principles , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand , the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point st@@ ö@@ bert is a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things in the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mali@@ cious plot , which is included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian ) . &quot;
as always the Ex@@ courses are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it is really great fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ancer sub @-@ beard of &quot; singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments random ins@@ anity , which could make this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I will show as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ ist Hot American Summer : Tw@@ ist Hot American Summer : Tw@@ ist Hot American Summer &quot; , &quot; as she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon meanwhile reminds on a different kind of nostal@@ gia : on the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a found TV series : a Romanian drama of two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main bul@@ ls - a hard spec@@ ter Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ z@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a ch@@ ender producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be syn@@ ced to English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some beautiful g@@ ags for watching ( the police spends the time to watch chess on television , such as Americans do it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous spokes@@ man - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ids Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a du@@ bi@@ ased propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan @-@ mask , is involved - that it often plays a single one . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it moves to that time , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; , who re@@ acts on a lower length , could make his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re better , since Gregor and Io@@ z@@ sef again visit the American Embassy , whose lobby always occupied by two thick men who are dev@@ oured a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the re@@ directed communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for fo@@ d@@ der for a money .
the fic@@ tional Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on the mid@@ day morning in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart many objects were searched for , like the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office on Friday evening . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 def@@ endants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 and already issued a warran@@ t against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials created large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same time swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany probably .
Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were in action . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia is accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , trials , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; even since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office was determined against organised drug stores in the south @-@ German area . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a br@@ isk exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the great use on the Wednesday morning also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , he primarily returned to the Italian nationality with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ in@@ fingen , were fired up several shots in a restaurant early in the morning , likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
ways large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens who should not emerge , &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register in Germany points out considerable shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ vi@@ ous mis@@ decisions in asylum proceedings .
&quot; the respon@@ s@@ for for the refugee management of the German federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen mode , has said that a media report is said to be attentive to large gaps in the country &apos;s country @-@ centric reg@@ isters . &quot;
&quot; lack of shortcomings where registered data could result in asylum proceedings and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to partly engra@@ ving mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; in a analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , the information is estimated ten million people with foreign nation@@ als , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will be managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality has not been well kept in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and are actually no longer in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can substantially dec@@ eler@@ ate processes , &quot; it says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about borro@@ wing people , EU citizens are those who do not have to travel out . &quot;
&quot; but such false states were led , however , led to a distorted debate on dealing with out levels , &quot; says it therefore in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started to return to Italy , refugee families with children under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children will return to Italy once they came from there . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , the BAM@@ F can conduct such procedures related to families with children - except for infants and infants , from Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migr@@ ant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the travel destination . &quot;
&quot; for reasoning : &quot; &quot; now the recording capacity for families with poor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) hold this commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to refugees during the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ person in the German Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , due to the lack of un@@ lawful recording conditions , and a threat to child abuse . &quot;
second best results achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons had already provided blood service for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , that were received on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 100 lit@@ res of blood with his now 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community at the meeting of the council has multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , how our body is created for this and we ap@@ plau@@ d the don@@ ors respect that their blood for foreigners is still un@@ selfish , &quot; &quot; underlined mayor Char@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several people , &quot; explained the cycle manager of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the con@@ gregations are broken into its constitu@@ ents . &quot;
that &apos;s why three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported the actions that were carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 funds , &quot; said the DRC manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change into the theatre was led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; already earlier , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ tt@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer to the majority dar@@ en@@ dar@@ s and were awarded for 50 participants each year . &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates by 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to disclose later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation was over an increase over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; income &quot; &quot; when they held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby in this month less of its members reached an increase , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue to rise to less than 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years Z@@ inser@@ tions would be necessary to grow the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and they said that the credit costs may need more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package , which was published a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks above the coming February , though said that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in short , since pressure on the real income will continue to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; on the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale &quot; than the markets await . &quot;
the markets anticip@@ ates the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed however , that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be limited . &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
she retained its growth forecasts for 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell upon these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and decreased by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have risen to rising expectations on a boost and increase GDP in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
growth is expected to lie in the third quarter at 0.@@ 3 % although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
&quot; the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by a rising inflation and low paid salary , since the tigh@@ tening becomes even worse before it is improved . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy can not be avoided in the next few years &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of its three @-@ year pre@@ diction can be clearly &quot; &quot; rec@@ u@@ perate &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pounds , which is compensated for a portion of lower consumption . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the shocking EU vote , the sin@@ king of the P@@ aci@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will achieve the prices and the economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank in the rates of interest rates , the call for an increase was increased , as the inflation has increased pressure on hard households , with three policy makers in July called for a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
inflation has declined from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % although the Bank said that this was expected and will put them on in the coming months .
the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in relation to their objective of 2 % is &quot; very &quot; to be assigned to the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent decline of s@@ wap bodies , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again since the credit don@@ ors want to end strongly in business and end the year in positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those with which existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be a controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ imposed prophy@@ l@@ actic prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk in high risk prevention by around 86 percent , now provided by healthcare services over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he is willing to finance the process , having confirmed the Court of Justice last year , having confirmed the authority of the Supreme Court to pay for the pre@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess event announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in whole England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that the EP significantly reduces the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection endangered .
taking Pr@@ EP in front of the intercourse means that there are just enough medication available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified suitable participants to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well @-@ known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a primary care doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of the pr@@ EP in advance , as it is collected and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to preventing HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of lasting progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England , to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner that leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority has to be done quickly that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the vice @-@ test medicine has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Sha@@ de Health Minister said : &quot; &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due for monthly delays and hesit@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how to transform this drug as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this is making us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they contribute to contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer @-@ tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker@@ age with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unken in 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne was not p@@ iled and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
I love myself in her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square footage was completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose they also commissioned the architectural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over@@ lap , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the sti@@ pulation .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were over@@ lap , without which we had to pick up . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to lay the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full of height - with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
for the mezz@@ anine looks a classic copper set of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down via the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored Gold@@ bel , silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lightning set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends there is a short corridor mir@@ r@@ ored to let him work longer .
in the kitchen the Spi@@ ess feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance there are mir@@ r@@ ored units for all cut@@ ters and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went into , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel strengthened , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it happens if you have to push the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al form a real estate ma@@ kler will happen , and a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the soil surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials which give the space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional relationship in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical wiring , in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standards in something quite incredible .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave it . &quot;
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar imperialist empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynastie , in a confrontation because of one of the biggest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &quot; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and business can be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to retreat from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers met 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family of West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail business . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family , about two thirds of the company &apos;s fortune and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction which implies that Col@@ in property has a value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the authors proposed by Col@@ in proposed have left him with what I thought for the best properties , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in the first affair . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from what Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have him excluded . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argued , this is not true , but raises Paul in front of you , some possessions in competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to dispute the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of the law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband &apos;s husband were Luigi &apos;s immigrants , the milk @-@ bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ er years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in the Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in the last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me , that he never wanted the brethren land to land , &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark had been paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has res@@ igned itself very , although he was a former AF@@ L manager and after a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media recorded with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; just Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can not say much &quot; , &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sorry that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not want to confess that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and said that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ umps of new staff is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President . &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new President of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on an even less course .
here is a piece by porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new President of the White House , conven@@ ed on his first working day with leading employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps of White House which he rep@@ airing : poor information that fall into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow , whether on paper or in correspondence , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ aming tr@@ ump by monitoring its media thickness . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship on television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV @-@ advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate was upset because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were persu@@ aded &quot; , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February compared with Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter @-@ habit ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridiculous .
perhaps these struggles officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more ni@@ tion material without their interventions .
we will probably never experience anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent the dump .
&quot; if his staff had managed to catch some times , trouble from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump controls . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house , which sets up out of competitive parties , constantly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
Poli@@ tico - entirely occupied with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons of doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , which was described by porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react as a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he will figure out from where these stem from . &quot;
&quot; that happened at the end of February when someone had har@@ med a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news , the website of the internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy governor of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , to be the source behind a pile of his le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of ch@@ can@@ es permanently from Twitter or that he had no concrete evidence , or that he vo@@ iced wrong accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then President Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
&quot; Kelly tried three months later , the same . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his consultants are still striving to influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
me@@ ter@@ ated criminals to the post of Euro@@ pol
&quot; the address is unknown , the help of the people is praying and hoped for . &quot;
the police spread across Europe this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards on dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ like heavy criminal , not known in accordance with their references , references from the population are hoped and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which is followed by the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Christmas calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had been shown , that many people hide their holiday destinations , meant that it was on the part of Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards have put together for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website of www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ i has been viewed by more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online chan@@ gers could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aires &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on war foot , which have tra@@ ded one from the municipality of drawn atrocities around a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
the travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street from Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; million@@ aires . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were thrown out in May , without having been thrown out by one of the Council laid out dig@@ ging dit@@ ch to prevent their incidents . &quot;
the tactical group found a gap in the defense plants and exposed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious residents have than@@ ked the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are drawn up there on Monday after being sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones onto the pedest@@ rians . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced through shame to implement , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and were moved back and are now back .
&quot; more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my com@@ ers , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridiculous that we have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; Spe@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a remote camp in the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to carry on them as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants get an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation where the court must prove , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
&quot; from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be invited . &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1st of the next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then integrated atmosphere company , mbH on the 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenues due to the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees , which came into the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the municipal council .
&quot; but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke at that time by more serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ e@@ hotels with chair@@ woman Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof for a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus Categ@@ ory under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men al@@ b .
&quot; hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation works are made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were removed , blankets to the part disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are fitted with large ch@@ opped showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows installed . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer presses themselves . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities . &quot;
&quot; if one does not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms is set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led to this . &quot;
the ideas of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to decide exactly . &quot;
&quot; just below a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the out@@ lines also are brought to front @-@ man , that is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Off@@ ers will create a Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia &apos;s affair at US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special er@@ mitt@@ ler Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Panel wrote the work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with appeal to the matter . &quot;
the paper summ@@ arized the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended its investigation and intensified .
the sender CN@@ N reported it was already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um related to a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us @-@ Secret Services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time mixed up in the presidential election in 2016 .
mu@@ eller examined whether there was a vote between the m@@ umps campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men should be standing , acting in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , Mu@@ eller also assumed more and more tr@@ umps in private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Rap@@ ist Tr@@ ump did personally have put into the centre and underlined the accus@@ ation , whether the president may hin@@ ders the judiciary in the wake of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand j@@ uries is to examine and decide the present evidence in possible failure cases and to decide whether an indictment has to be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called the Pro@@ Cham@@ bers .
&quot; most of them , they are switched on , if it is a major and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched from the pro@@ secutor to re@@ charge people under o@@ ath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N stations , the inv@@ itations were already exhibited that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; individuals who were involved in the meeting were called on a statement , it was called in the report . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. too , Tr@@ m@@ umps and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort was with the interview . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ sex@@ ist said on Thursday night in the US television , that the suspension is that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t be timi@@ d in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on the end , in order to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new dis@@ closures , the President resum@@ ed a speech in West Virginia on Thursday to present the Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the issue gives the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about which they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he know nothing about the suspension of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , this work usually works in the secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House advoc@@ ated any action that accelerated the work of the agent in &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; way . &quot;
&quot; the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey , I told three times , that not against the president . &quot;
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this re@@ pro@@ strate &apos;s accus@@ ations had become loud , he didn &apos;t want to im@@ pe@@ de the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; in June before a Senate Committee , Com@@ bo asked him for hi@@ ring the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the study .
&quot; according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the Special Off@@ ers and its employees . &quot;
the extingu@@ ishing spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent special edition of Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair at the later beg@@ ged President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the President of the President of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow this step however .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented on Thursday that the special edition could not be released anymore .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic ic@@ eberg lifts in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has solved itself from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for polar@@ isation and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tri@@ llion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large col@@ os@@ sus ki@@ osk now over north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gar@@ ds who have registered researchers in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent of climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of ice , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; overall , however , it has been a series of unusual clas@@ ps for approximately 30 years in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to warming . &quot;
the well @-@ broken p@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
sh@@ ell@@ ings flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it grows more and more in the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
&quot; in the north of this skir@@ mish , the balance of wa@@ xing and Canc@@ el had been dis@@ rupted several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete sh@@ el@@ fe@@ i be there , writes AW@@ I research scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C tur@@ el@@ fe@@ is in danger , because the front @-@ front pit@@ ched have never been as far as currently withdrawn . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice @-@ plate stand under stress and can be de@@ pressed if at a key point a piece ab@@ rupt . &quot;
the melting of sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level not as it pus@@ hes on the water and pus@@ hes as much water as it returns after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the tail @-@ la@@ ises leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low level , the British research project writes to observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is named after AW@@ I data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
&quot; at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of the ice tag now comes to a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most widespread withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ i would go back again or go back in the long term , and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though this researcher will not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not to climate change , so in the last few decades a lot of ice @-@ deser@@ ts of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are torn down . &quot;
&quot; this long brick , the Antar@@ c@@ tica covers in the direction of South America . &quot;
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has declined since the 1950s to 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
the temperature decline has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has gone by around three degrees in the past 50 years , and therefore one of the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to lift up Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U is calling out of the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag took 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have the first working day behind themselves .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications were available for those places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the raised requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the group of M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general management are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
administration should develop a concept for recruitment and human development after the request of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but forward @-@ oriented of the application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be orient@@ ated inside and outside , indicating concrete measures for cross @-@ access systems and include a training of training , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you haven &apos;t knew before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a right @-@ right &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related benefits comes from the service . &quot;
so the highest time for action thus do not remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was long ago already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise , when he was publicly challenged the human resources and the other parties were intrigu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; people want to be scrut@@ ini@@ zed all the possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the trade administration with the unions - maybe also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U attempts to pay the employees and officials better than it fores@@ ees the collective service for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only if you change to a higher level which is oriented at professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new Pro@@ substitution Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Far@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGOs @-@ migrants
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs , the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue , if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities en@@ camp@@ ed a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth re@@ tet &apos; because their team had collabor@@ ated effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , declined , to express themselves in the presence of the Italian Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our highest priority . so we are sorry that we are not able to operate at the moment in search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had re@@ ed the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ ail &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew took hose to board migrants that are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ ators can cycle off , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the b@@ ail@@ out capacity in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motiv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Conduct , we have to have boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all an Italian police officers on board who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously stated to consider the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ e@@ Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring about &quot; significant changes or disability &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ ie said , meanwhile , that the number of migrants who returned to the rescue operations in Italy , had declined sharp@@ ly in recent weeks , leading to the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizenship in this month , known about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ echn@@ ya , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
Ascen@@ sions and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin outdoor post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , for four days long tri@@ als and attractions . &quot;
there were three free guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were lookout spots , partly on towers , one of which could look far over the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
in between there was time for long asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day she went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival .
&quot; again , the bel@@ vedere turns out a lookout point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ red &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days many height of altitude were cancelled .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and rep@@ ut@@ ations brought with a welcome break . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the be@@ eke@@ eper in the open @-@ air inhal@@ e Sole .
also new city was driven .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres , the group had seen the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest of its best side - sporty and culturally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga are available for e @-@ sport
sitting the sports @-@ stars in the future before the computer consoles , instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium . &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high G@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; these have also recognised the first federal states , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and at least the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in the middle of July and took two professionals for the computer game of FIFA under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain that there are several associations , on this train . &quot;
&quot; the next weekend , the football @-@ world association held FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
even Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen have now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 years old that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations were trying to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the federal states to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports also , lights are established in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
for many people the idea is to be unusual .
also In@@ go F@@ seals has long been confronted with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical responses show that one can find even in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress actions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; besides , we need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also take care of their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; F@@ seals also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to run at Online @-@ Play , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were lacking . &quot;
&quot; positively , the scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are internationally on their way , this is like a big global family , since there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active Enter@@ tain@@ ment@@ software ( BI@@ U ) says the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in order to ensure that 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments . &quot;
in three years sales will be at 130 million .
against the nearly 2.2 billion euros of the Bundesliga .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ op Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is part of the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton &apos;s Car@@ ver is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe there is a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as educational , &quot; says F@@ seals . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football clubs associations according to D@@ utt are now committed to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany behind &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to fall only in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old days is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can not cling , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind G@@ it@@ tern and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June due to neg@@ lig@@ ently killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ ance .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until the appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a psych@@ ic illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and an cream @-@ colored leaf , Carter is with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ right eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; however , Car@@ ters lawyer said it is a &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circumstance , which she is totally de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot;
&quot; however , Ju@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read an explanation by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy that said it &apos; was not a day I don &apos;t mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , in spite of all my pains that we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be &quot; &quot; per@@ secuted &quot; &quot; from the realization that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep on me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim another suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 from a coal hydr@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters &apos;s word statements , that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging you on , Spring of a building , erst@@ e@@ che yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she told in several news that she had spent two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing what you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and prescribed that they would benefit by any press of the case .
the case has been divided by the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced in 2007 by murder of her British room@@ mate before it was acqu@@ itted 2 years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle &quot; deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua has allowed me to run at the Audi Cup as captain was no coincidence .
the FC Bayern will trust the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation is not al@@ ai@@ ded .
&quot; something was different at its place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra garments was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see , he made himself allocated le@@ dges to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as a captain captain . &quot;
well the one could have run better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach could also indicate me as such .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in youth bac@@ kl@@ ists , Deb@@ ate and just out of vacation with existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide . &quot;
su@@ gars are distributed among the dearest one to those who wants to keep a lot of humor who wants to keep in mood .
&quot; so who has been chosen to face the legacy of L@@ ame , a small extra motivation can only be good . &quot;
&quot; I confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , that is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ mir had at this start @-@ up report like the one who can take the field in his hands , too . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al therewith , his missing fitness to play ( til@@ ted hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus to tie out to the achievements of Asia @-@ travel ( fol@@ ly also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus don &apos;t have a negative effect on their first appearance in Bavaria . &quot;
the all worked out quite well .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both agile sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and also in the game building a few times tried out successfully . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave the result , that the result was not that way as we have hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; si@@ ege , Tem@@ po@@ changes : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavaria &apos;s world is still in the press @-@ related , one saw afterwards to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for instance did not have one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ mir said for a few crack statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence there : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noted . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one . &quot;
Al@@ aba motivated Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s winning foot@@ b@@ aller has been reported shortly before the game via Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wanted all the best .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ based Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings
&quot; there is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was an economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than a year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and corporations from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ aming the old Minister at the same time .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke is all blocked . &quot;
&quot; the biggest about @-@ face is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the mosquito of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Adenauer , is now in the primary list of the country . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes to plan a plan process until 2021 is supposed to stand the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans is also the west of the country , which stands in the pre @-@ urgent need for the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minister@@ ial speaker in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks to increase the sales of the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Label in the wine of the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Label in order to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing also have an open ear for people who want to found its own company , the BC@@ CI . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Tri@@ er sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium volume of 1000 euros for the constitu@@ ents of the master examination , and 2500 euro , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master formation process . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains however long .
&quot; in the planned road construction , be quick facts to create , at the same time , it was missing to the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main managing director of the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; with 56 new engineers , the wi@@ dening of the national mode wants to adjust mobility , so far only 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U presidents Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the invoice , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million in the retention of national highways . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
serious be the previous broad@@ band @-@ band in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the 3.4 . &quot;
it compl@@ ained about sc@@ aling Internet connections and abor@@ tions .
&quot; ex @-@ economic ministries in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics , and is still in the supervisory boards of the wind power company Pro wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months after in@@ consistency , the countryside has already left the area . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers faced with a counter@@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ president said the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as a limited restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles prohi@@ bit or to restrict . &quot;
Daimler announced that there are three million Mercedes cars to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of the exhau@@ sts of diesel vehicles , take also to install , take also what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to pamp@@ er the powerful Auto@@ companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices , which can regulate emissions if a car was tested , but go back to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi .
&quot; former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused of having installed a system in order to deal with emissions regulations in Europe and a request that was concentrated on the United States , has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen hard to strain : the luxury automobile manufacturers contributes significantly to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laugh against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the most published carto@@ ons carto@@ on@@ ists , the tu@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
even with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still working and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; during the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a artist for lucky cards , which was frustrated by him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said again . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60s made a breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist of cities inspire him .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o figures cav@@ or@@ ting in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; on the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing , even today almost ten hours daily . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches are continuing to find his im@@ min@@ ent figures worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los , and test@@ es animal in its drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ ed for thousands . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , to get to the cinema circuit to 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , it is more focuss@@ ed on the TV series , which is produced as its original desig@@ nations . &quot;
lav@@ ender is threatened by Provence on climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is remin@@ ding of the insects in dro@@ ught and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , which are trying to find solutions that are preparing to find solutions . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute , CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and fall much more in autumn . &quot;
this has an effect on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small ornam@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf @-@ calves , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes having a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are being considered , include better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also the proven mixture of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of sorts , which are more resistant to dry . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime ; corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug war .
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; discuss two high @-@ level journalists , which feels safer : they should take their children with the office , which were the destination of an attack with shells , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table in the front of the space : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ inal feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to be on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest period of violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to have been in office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are on attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there was at least seven dead in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; under the latter , her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the Co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deep felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , who shows his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; t T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been a Son@@ ata @-@ Federal Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office , in order to deal with the cases of journalists , it has started in accordance with the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murder that are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are uneven and even though the terrain is still obli@@ que . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we distr@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot; &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to walk in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an around freely .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest over the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival groups struggle here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the gra@@ ve@@ yard is full of the two @-@ story mol@@ es of drugs , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el that has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected G@@ ang@@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper which had released the same story to leave the land to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived our friends and colleagues for so long that he would always be there .
&quot; he was active in 2003 as a senior re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter@@ ing the ru@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; in time , the paper has earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting , and the sales and advertising took . &quot;
&quot; they loved to publish hard @-@ looking investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez , Val@@ dez , won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , where ever she has led . &quot;
he gave me voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in the past October . &quot;
&quot; you need to take over the task that will assign you as a journalist - either that , or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wn bird , who was like a do@@ ckers , the friend , who knew generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted out on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ as , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask them : was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has compelled them to question their own assumptions on how to do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home@@ start and long @-@ stri@@ ps , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
to trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days previously announced that Spy@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two poli@@ c@@ emen receive protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ scale district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters were questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the poli@@ c@@ emen , who signed the governor itself as not trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the Ber@@ gl@@ ist , where the drug persons are facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has clicked on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an exit to the government spending , focused on the hometown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the Office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , the governing Institu@@ tional Social Democratic Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of highly toxic cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this e@@ at@@ ery including a one who escaped a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man .
&quot; only a few months before , the reader had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; before we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been devoted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , which are opposed to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they had ever expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
Re@@ por@@ k Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez away a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Pro@@ secutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials saying , based on DNA testing that it is to be . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become stronger by acting in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on wal@@ k@@ way and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tried to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , to pronoun@@ ce journalists , and to release them , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has therefore asked for her to be re @-@ classified by the government , because she is concerned that her anger does hurt her objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico had organised crime , organised by governmental officials and a con@@ current society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journalism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug persons but also on behalf of politicians and security forces , organized with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; took over half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you , because they want you keep the mouth shut , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
&quot; nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ ar@@ lip@@ as , six years ago . &quot;
&quot; your body was found along with a note that supposedly was signed by the Z@@ etas box : &quot; &quot; I am here for my reports . &quot;
a computer@@ isation and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others do continue how El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its director in 2004 did .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez directed publicly to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial page on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have escaped from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , like the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , born in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue the work , there is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , indicates that the drug stores it scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , as at once all their phones began to spread . &quot;
a series of sh@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ ages and security forces in the proximity of the swimming pool Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the board edge you have released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ els nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a look at the poli@@ c@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose finger @-@ finger was visible for quite u@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce attracted its traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only remember , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day she was murdered , the tra@@ inee asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ak his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue as well as a start@@ ling .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable nas@@ al horn of a Canadian mountain workers were so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that she could even notice that his g@@ ful skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; referred him as &quot; the ro@@ wing , ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , which has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period before 110 million and 112 million years . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserv@@ ative condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast inside the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy oil . &quot;
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only flas@@ hes a little over the eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the science story as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although he is covered with armor and a changing tank , probably threatened by meat and send din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ achu@@ ti@@ fication that is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it is threatened by larger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier did the first time headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked with the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ el@@ ta Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen had made it possible to record Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists that document patterns and form of scales and arm@@ aments over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ying , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ allo@@ y is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far exceeds that of the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by the flesh of the din@@ osau@@ r din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that fav@@ ored the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that apply counter @-@ sh@@ ying - think of deer , z@@ ebras or wat@@ chers - are much smaller and hur@@ ting than prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s @-@ predat@@ ors of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous must have been &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s is red@@ dish .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his con@@ served intest@@ ine , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as the South of South today , and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks like almost the same as in the early Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period .
&quot; you do not need much fantasy to use to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ time was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who stood on two legs , the earth . &quot;
&quot; though the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was hun@@ ted the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of some of his fur@@ ious anc@@ est@@ or . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ ras@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tons he@@ avier monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the professional journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta vers@@ oul after death in the sea and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , as he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the ro@@ wing @-@ ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips given by its shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters has been sha@@ ken by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ding river it was flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s kept its armor in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains even hol@@ lowed Pan@@ zer@@ oes along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy panels that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right for@@ ter is on his side , his five fingers are tigh@@ tened up . &quot;
I can count the scales from his sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday night at A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass @-@ kar@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilometres long distances - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) in the late Thursday afternoon on a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people were injured .
&quot; after the first indications of the police were between 17@@ .00 o &apos;clock between the connector and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( county district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm in almost 30 cars , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ locking . &quot;
&quot; above all , there is no information about the precise number of recent developments . &quot;
it stands for light to medium @-@ sized injuries and said a poli@@ ze@@ al pre@@ acher .
a large over@@ lap on b@@ ail@@ ship vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was a distance of about ten kilometers long back .
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reported , it came also on the road train to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ men have noted the characteristics of the vehicle , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 un@@ event@@ ful then a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was a collision between a car and a car . &quot;
a rescue @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter was on the road to the accident .
German railways : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced this : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is wi@@ dening into his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff .
comes from the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ us@@ ft or ri@@ ps the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow .
card control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the created ticket control .
one simply confirms by phone that you have taken his place and de@@ em the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes from , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers are doing already .
&quot; you also have to have bought it via the app , the DB navig@@ ator app , which anyway is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservations .
&quot; because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you test the test , then a button becomes the electronic de@@ valuation . &quot;
the train guides get on their mobile devices a message that driver &apos;s X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; comes the train guide at the ticket control to seat Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting with already ent@@ less online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can still sleep , keep on , keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket control by our train staff , chec@@ kl@@ ed in the DB Navigator software itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs .
&quot; who often drives rail , knows that besides delays and pas@@ se@@ est trains the ticket controls are among the largest doctors . &quot;
&quot; because often , in any case you do not have any documents that you need to make the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the personnel ID or a document , or otherwise a document you have to indicate . &quot;
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between the train guides and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the section or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time takes care of other concerns . &quot;
&quot; in addition , only a small number of test customers can use the new service . &quot;
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw@@ numbers on the same circuit are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; ?
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell got sha@@ ken up to its core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because nobody else had master@@ ed the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , a non @-@ weapon black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white poli@@ c@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed to twe@@ et live . &quot;
he po@@ ised a picture of om@@ wns le@@ blo@@ naked body that was spread out on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild &quot; , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ et on people at the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , crying , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
you watched a live fe@@ eder when a poli@@ cem@@ an was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said that secured another poli@@ cem@@ an is his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; he remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have used to ourselves and which we can call you typical .
in that moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which is from the point of view of human beings who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who took a floral dress and a suitable crown , she bes@@ po@@ ke the two a conversation that they had countless times in this morning over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember , how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and put it up .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in whom they personally have not experienced racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South of Flor@@ y@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ area as the activists representing the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner . &quot;
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to accept shape for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in Organ@@ ize .
it all came . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to just document what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to my profession : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often by white men - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area who is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his dedication brought the project closer together , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to concentrate on Ferr@@ ab@@ over experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but rather a community who com@@ eth together , &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ er &apos;s life , how she loves himself and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ er &apos;s history repeatedly give the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , which have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ led by Martin in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are continually fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notic@@ ing that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it consists of that &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ atism type of action , &quot; in the Fer@@ rell due to its identity as the heart of the movie . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front front because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area which she calls her home : &quot; a mess .
&quot; yet it compl@@ ained to a chant and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the streets three years ago . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support them .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; scale &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ edge of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been divi@@ ding the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the topic very little .
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook @-@ Page &quot; People &apos;s fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; for one to say in the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be genuine &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or quite plain : &quot; &quot; magnitude &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates can build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which the other businesses will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ ep@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peasant market hall is standing , in the 13 mark@@ eters market their products . &quot;
the start of construction will be at the end .
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building , namely the Bed@@ a Square , with the possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Room : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always love to be very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop was discovered for us too .
&quot; we would wish that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market entry in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping &apos;s Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; if clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ or and supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; of this , there are already enough in our city . &quot;
you can see how many charges are still empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not yet another weekly market , it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered are offered fresh , is largely offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ sc@@ ant inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop transactions are reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies , as the rent r@@ ents are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special transactions there is almost no more and that which is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
mainly : where should the farmers market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
&quot; or does it already create the spec@@ ter @-@ gallery in advance , all shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply does not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , does not need any one . &quot;
&quot; in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmers market hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no more space . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible , hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ cuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the earlier Secret Analy@@ st has released a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they made public messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , says A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( one matching similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and groundbreaking dissi@@ dent , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted through the algorithms analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as some intellectual comment not only about the formation of DNA @-@ data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has spoken openly about the identity as a woman , has been condemned for 20 acc@@ ages , including six bre@@ aches of the es@@ sp@@ as law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a bas@@ kets , black @-@ white sel@@ fish@@ y , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver and a plat@@ ter @-@ blonde is associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg started with the great success of her 2012 @-@ Project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in it , the Artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as ci@@ gar sle@@ eves and che@@ wing g@@ um , extracted the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press show at the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were exchanged at the same time , several letters exchanged during the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images &quot; &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ ation would convert the verdict and it was able to personally see the exhibition . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military strike in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy encounter . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat down@@ ward and ar@@ ctic , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways , which he should actually fix , continue to disp@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a wall written on the wall of the gallery called Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature beneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation which were based on gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is a thou@@ sand@@ al of Cs , and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) to show how amazing similarly , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own space is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a free @-@ hand ef@@ on in the hand from the discipl@@ in@@ archy of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they address your speech , then they won &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so do never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted out of Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it should be fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but when they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ rum which gather together as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where its genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ks were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowds , &quot; said De@@ ad@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement who formed a Chelsea , like the movement , which also hidden behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford for killing .
&quot; a country @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , which were sought as an susp@@ ects , after a man had been found in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ ain ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several styles died . &quot;
a joint warning system by the police authority of Chicago published joint warning system was that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was declared dead in the place of action for dead , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them@@ self has been a professor of biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University for 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ self now being evaluated and excluded from the deliber@@ ation of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK to help the US investigation authorities in any way .
&quot; the statement added , that War@@ r@@ ens were shocked and want him to be . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urged the susp@@ ects firm to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a presentation of its place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , reinforce &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building managers of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , unless the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; it was confirmed by safety cameras , that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building . &quot;
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a potential home country . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada River in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vi@@ v@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap has been updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ introduction of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , it contains nothing that could cause Russia cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list was noted , however , that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the results of the W@@ ada approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged stat@@ ely funded D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we are introducing the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words coinci@@ des with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian Commercial Center R@@ Sports at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has added to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the principal residence of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Officer Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups which will help your business will not become the closest u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers mour@@ ned to the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it brought people from outside to help .
&quot; a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; through creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers allow to handle C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they have now tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies is used to measure employees commitment . &quot;
&quot; he said , she said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feeling in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most ail@@ ments and which leaders have low additions - so you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the nearest u@@ ber that has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then , a former employee published a blog post , which has been reported an environment of insul@@ ts , in which those who have spoken to be punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw an asc@@ ending interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the u@@ ber @-@ fin . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting companies can send customized &quot; &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ card of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employee &apos;s bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business guide is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its employees are poorly treated or beha@@ ves very eth@@ ically , there can be costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and skill , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has set off @-@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their company &apos;s central . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company &apos;s central , submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days general Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good possibility to pursue the discomfort of staff . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent supports , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were formerly hidden in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or illi@@ cit intern@@ ti@@ ken@@ - quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ level view over experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and staff engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that businesses realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; in November , Gl@@ ass@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex on research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only available . &quot;
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is making their voices and that work that you do , then feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which are used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors gain ren@@ ditions when their portfolio companies are running well . businesses run good if employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and the use of the employees to increase , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company does not take any measures . &quot;
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can grow and employed . &quot;
&quot; if you ask after 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much to collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not followed by employees , &quot; &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
&quot; and whom do you not take care of , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now manages monthly team pol@@ ls now , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustrated staff , it was able to organise the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company keeps getting new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose your company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
&quot; it dates back to 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers will be entertained on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus . &quot;
some have drawn their tri@@ p@@ ments and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are inscri@@ bed to the summer courses will return to their final exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Wasser@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday to Tuesday was opened . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she really extended their days - at least until the finals on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to be able to meet the ready @-@ packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise taken away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ kes postponed the beginning of Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school , for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons were conducted in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August 18 exercises , they should hold out in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he can support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point in the busy routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put this tremendous burden three or four days at them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply have pushed it down , they plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , as soon as the camp termin@@ ates its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been thrown with pedest@@ rians , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ te that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far from thinking that people there rent a room and then setup a exercise there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ or from an exercise , it is quite a good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to escal@@ ate facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fac@@ t@@ lements of third parties and then show their results using the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website that it is possible to begin with the use of actu@@ alized mechanical learning methods , to recognize possible false messages and to send it to fac@@ e@@ audi@@ tor , which may display results from the original review from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distri@@ butions for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe they have also influenced the U.S. presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to be punished for social media networks , as it did not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings such as the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation of German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany have started a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fact @-@ beaten parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ment for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;

creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the History of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he said we@@ d@@ ti@@ ly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; changed the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpected . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agen@@ das in the 1700 @-@ s , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b printing !
&quot; and letters always smells of smoke , for then there was a fire due to the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he was himself as well . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so struck with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England ( &quot; To be honest : I have judged a little over@@ rated &quot; ) , this seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; Castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle like about the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles to spend centuries in the dit@@ ch .
&quot; he walked through the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with lands@@ caped , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , he drank &quot; &quot; whis@@ key &quot; &quot; and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust first received the full access as the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive he described as &quot; hundreds of years , where aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , those who possessed what they possessed : &quot; you could mean that land conflict would be boring &quot; , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys leave all their gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an turmoil that stood in 13@@ 80 at the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it , who hid the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is presented from the 18th century , filling its own funeral with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was du@@ g . ) &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney , &quot; The Lords Tem@@ por@@ ky to be his aun@@ ts , always raise debt and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men sol@@ ves their debt crisis , by destroying rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise copper . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his commitment in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique write experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on E@@ es@@ per@@ ma@@ ki , the terrain of a San@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed since then by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the exposure of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef will be launched on Friday their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
still until Thursday Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team to hold Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there is a celebration at the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , write them on their yesterday un@@ released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some better than it seems .
&quot; after all , we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Con@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action you go for more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a common promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a middle five @-@ digit amount can be set up in Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es on Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ alties and audi@@ tors in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
&quot; but nothing is a routine among the Turkish armed forces , a year after the coup . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the heads of government , the five vice @-@ president , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part . &quot;
&quot; in this way , civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins to the military .
&quot; Chief of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , of air forces and nav@@ y were dropped . &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p President Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als was fired .
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire squee@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who are directly involved in the coup attempt , will remain in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he would give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; published an article with the head@@ line &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which among other things manifest in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for sol@@ em@@ bodies , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the big ven@@ ance in the army and the security forces continues to go further . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan made another 7@@ 3@@ 95 State of State , including 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as guardian of the mund@@ ane state of state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; , a name not called officers , who sought after the coup attempt from fear of persecution in other countries asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; full of extremism and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not let Nato are not cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the involvement of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited from the media . &quot;
&quot; it fores@@ ees to reduce the legal immigrants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill &apos;s draft is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do this by increasing the way citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains @-@ migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge which will benefit from our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to di@@ re track for racing
&quot; again and over the past few months , there has been un@@ disputed that the future of the racing event - now it &apos;s going to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the m@@ aro@@ den stretch , on which the Tourist bahn runs , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing car in the long term , according to the traffic @-@ Ministry information will be started on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and proc@@ ure the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ g , the country has become important for tourism , especially for tourism , &quot; declared traffic @-@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
&quot; at about 2.5 million euros , the cost of the maintenance of the track has been reduced to approximately 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; of this sum , the land assumed 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently finally tuned , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as the operators are already talking about the technical details .
&quot; thus the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway station will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the rac@@ ow shuttle service will be ordered in December 2017 .
the rac@@ ow shuttle is one mainly among tourists popular rail link between railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and rac@@ ec@@ sti@@ ff .
&quot; in the past few months , in the course of a pilot project , it has been tested if the route is used by sufficient many people to order it again in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also highly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex @-@ robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought that in 2017 there may be no more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ eri@@ ed professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said to the publication of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern rop@@ es have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin , which feels warm up - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot about the form of breast @-@ war@@ ts up to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still worrying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that have a Step@@ ford @-@ woman be progressive . &quot;
modern rop@@ es have become robots with a silicon skin .
&quot; for example , the real B@@ oti@@ x robot allows the users to adapt their robots to properties such as relap@@ se . &quot;
and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of relap@@ sing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; black@@ ness the website of True . &quot;
&quot; so they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
during the day they have their m@@ oods over the course of the day - like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , to be fixed on conversation or can &quot; &quot; be &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties , the aggres@@ sions on rape , if you go one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( says here : res@@ sing ) Far@@ rah is , be@@ definitely one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True H@@ x@@ x@@ xy with@@ a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is stated on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , this sex @-@ robots are not just a fairy or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and its increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal for gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men are naturally not going to hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R noted its rising popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what oo@@ zes out of the edge @-@ areas can be in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until the free market gives the permission for this . &quot;
&quot; there is yet some over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robot appears in a time that the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has pra@@ ising women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ est aspect of television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the hidden body and the spread @-@ off eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the target behind these sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
&quot; their builders want them to feel humane , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you cannot walk or move away from their companion .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing , which implies independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
umps great achievement ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney a term of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ ction of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US voters , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ le there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relative .
we are all told us to burst our fil@@ ter@@ rains .
&quot; less noticed is the power of m@@ umps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousine , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family who visited New York this week . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can Relation@@ ship , with which they had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculiar at the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another connection that this also involves considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by trac@@ ump , but the ex@@ hilar@@ ating effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ace@@ ful possibility that the kittens will no longer meet us in a day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a real long @-@ time scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison with its standards suddenly as a term of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the accident - the dog on the Auto@@ d@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how to release his tax return ) - both in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences occur . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans will only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an in@@ estim@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousine was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ els of the New York Park@@ ing department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are scarce and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate change gives us this in a marked way . &quot;
&quot; so many stere@@ otypes of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
thirty years later and I am still not quite worried about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years can go to it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to drop the rating with a 15 % tips - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slo@@ wing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ted pressure on the server to put the personality into a situation that is not required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ ru@@ gged , while I made tired of experience to extend my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us laid out in the hospital with chest pain

the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us sentence by which they say it was too late .

instead of a chicken boy a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , he sm@@ elled , the eagle pointed out on a high mountain its wings , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes displayed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the hen danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ ders contributed to the bet . &quot;

&quot; the young is different from the other kittens ( chi@@ cks ) , but otherwise . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose was to be free .
wish each four @-@ month old that he was accepted at his new school .
&quot; it followed the head@@ word to the colleagues of the former school manager Michael Müller , who is repeatedly coming back into teaching sen@@ ti@@ ses , and the par@@ ental representatives . &quot;

software update for diesel cars : what people need to know now
how exactly can the software update be held ?
are diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered updates on a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; you should improve the emission behavior of cars for the emission levels of Euro 5 , and partially Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE car Club Europe are estim@@ ations :
is the new promotion compulsory ?
&quot; no , the handled software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before only apply to vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the broad@@ way office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but they have not yet been named an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection may be required , it will be done within the frame . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fit in total pull ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the app@@ endi@@ ces from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , volunte@@ ered to do not do the car manufacturers on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but just in the regions , where the har@@ b@@ inger was dro@@ w . &quot;
in rural areas there has so far not been a loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE inclined to wait for a sale yet .

&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to clarify their view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy @-@ Center , is the biggest culmin@@ ation in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the earlier prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ der , continues in R@@ ente next year . &quot;
the passage is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years has been W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ itors .
and the work is still great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press .
&quot; he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for His followers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , mir@@ ac@@ ulous claim that no application does not feed the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for a architect or engineer at the end of the time .
that is to be said - taking into account the regular termin@@ ations - still enough time for a review .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach has been fun@@ ic@@ iled for the Board of Directors as a sub @-@ law office , the applicant has to pre@@ dict the appropriate inclu@@ sions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizens &apos; proximity to the city and himself are important , says W@@ acker , who is told by a good working atmosphere , as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the office for more than 30 years , some major projects have been accumulated at the W@@ acker &apos;s pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; &quot; is he dedicated to the building and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ bia @-@ park around are stimulated .
&quot; the Kin@@ zi@@ g@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still the subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; If we do it right &quot; , &quot; it is estimated . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; alternat@@ ely , be there for a municipal master of great man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and ten@@ derness it could be quite flexible .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town is as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , which fits in when new buildings are approved , stressed the out@@ going city master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Municipal Champion is high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is construc@@ tor , &quot; in the end everything ran here over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ ture ) has been doing business for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to be@@ et Roland W@@ acker , should ask for information from the city of Has@@ l@@ ach and have a completed study as a diploma engineer , and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; municipal and civil engineering , construction planning , capit@@ ol matters , administration of urban estate assets , municipal equipment with building yard and municipal law as well as sub @-@ rights authority including monument protection . &quot;
bike thrown on lines : southwest route locked
&quot; according to the police , the most unknown perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bike from the railway station in the area of the lead road ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; these have been so heavily damaged , that the her@@ itable freight @-@ train had to be stopped . &quot;
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and looking for the night hours after them .
near the scene we have witnessed a ros@@ ar@@ oom Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike riders had been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ et stream , &quot; said the BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the or the perpetrators brought themselves in great danger and also threaten the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delays and costs of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen by rail customers could also come to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; overall , be excluded from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the damages were re@@ medi@@ ed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern rail route could be led without disability . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were free Friday afternoon , two of them looked at the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ te@@ amm@@ ers did not fell out , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to the BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 meters over@@ lines . &quot;
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help to rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammation of any disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; however , a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects some 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach fights and r@@ ann@@ ons , recur@@ rent , or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , loss of weight and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; during those affected is normally advised to avoid flesh and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner University out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ine to make sure that damaging micro@@ bes , which hide in the food not to penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of releasing inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the equilibrium gets too far towards inflammation , it can result from a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ cell is found in mice , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires trac@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of proteins - to det@@ ach the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition tolerant , less infl@@ amed intestinal epitheli@@ um , if the same system also plays with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that had the tolerance , when she found out that a group of academic powers had such cells , but another group of the same trunk that had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the du@@ ps of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ ential and were found six bacterial species , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without lack of mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a steri@@ le environment so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria carried out on the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then resulted in small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
&quot; the active component from the liquid has been cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the fo@@ d@@ der of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ most values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us have reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ based products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop these cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , since these cells are inflamm@@ ations based on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ gar can lead to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believe Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der was his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A @-@ super Cup begins against real Madrid on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the holder &apos;s role when people mar@@ ched as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , MA@@ TIC had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic star@@ ters also Victor Lin@@ del@@ a and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent uncovered this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho nor three further additions , but he ins@@ isted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four prime commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they put a lot of effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ car manufacturer has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; pilots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar schir@@ men the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a bur@@ sting for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new depression for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; just as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , looked at S &amp; D Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely any interference from the party central , just not a head@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important desire of the election champi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed the fundamental change . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House has been monitoring the events in the SPD state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not have been described by head@@ wind . &quot;
there were deep stops .
and indeed one by one .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Confederation is a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Greens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be steady , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fac@@ tional question of a Greens MEP , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the presidential election his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal managing director Michael Kellner has called on the ab@@ stain@@ ed low @-@ Sax@@ on Greens El@@ ke T@@ ests to return their mandate .
the survi@@ ves to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voting .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return to their mandate , &quot; &quot; said the federal managing and electoral campaign of the Greens to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not all be true , &quot; &quot; si@@ ghing an SPD election campaign than on Friday afternoon , the new Hi@@ v@@ eiling will be the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after the transition of Green Members El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U without its own ruling majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades at the time . &quot;
after the European Parliament elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
that was then also - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute Party was smooth . &quot;
lab@@ orious back the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when she had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with it came the next depression .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus in this weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because in the crisis @-@ crisis communication then everything was wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW exhau@@ st , and its role in the Supervisory Board , the low @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister had already been in criticism for some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional values came added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps straight , Wei@@ l tried to keep getting stronger in the latter weeks , in the covenant . &quot;
&quot; the ambitions of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , also remained hidden from Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
they allowed him to stabil@@ ise the party &apos;s stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l becomes no fault at the &quot; internal constraints &quot; of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Greens in essence . &quot;
and Schulz did not at all .
sometimes the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Greens , and here mainly to the ab@@ y@@ wheel of the female parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Ms. T@@ ia presents their own careers over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party of Party in the SPD group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ests has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the country of the Lower Greens , so the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on members . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD group , compl@@ ained a &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote against four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who runs the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD as peak can@@ did@@ acy to the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career progression of a future CD@@ U MEPs the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann on . &quot;
he called to clarify the background .
&quot; I want to know , if more or more or more commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen has been given . &quot;
conveyor equipment for the City of Ort@@ k@@ ern III
&quot; who wants to be refres@@ hed in the years , can get assistance from the country soon . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the eg city development will be received on Wednesday . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once again a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 it has been in delicate san@@ itation .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment region I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the total funding . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the grant still remained at 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous re@@ organisation are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote the internal development , not only to tap into new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one got the information on April 4 , Karlsruhe that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which would be 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest from the church . &quot;
how does a san@@ itation work come now ?
&quot; one will continue to study as bar@@ eller , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned fields any interest in marriage . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional borders may also shift again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ties occurred on Wednesday evening , Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose limits the renov@@ ations would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of inner cities , improving residential and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would object @-@ related , which means per plot . &quot;
the re@@ organization would then finally be defined as stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding exp@@ ires since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out at once , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , it is scheduled to take place as the pro@@ posi@@ tional description , so that in the coming year the renov@@ ations can begin . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained , then , that every commune would have to perform the said pre @-@ investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is the reason to evaluate and decide the city &apos;s mis@@ sibility , and to decide when it is re@@ printed , and to what extent . &quot;
it will then also be registered for the respective plot in the basement .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come again , and will make a picture of the situation , she said . &quot;
&quot; well , Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and estate agent &quot; , &quot; where it is possible to view the tree and refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a living space can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; bow bow &quot; &quot; is only possible if in building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , to bear in mind , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new measures are not competitive . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler said that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , warns us first . &quot;
&quot; you could not reserve funding for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the end the photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a renov@@ ations &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to come up with a handle in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can access his door@@ step , and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory firm in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which raises the American production last month , costs tax@@ payers to the military , which were left to TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was made in Connecticut , in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the Military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of this because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of its superi@@ ors , the deputy marina for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter on 17 July , at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , met for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared from 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours required a second team for the return trip would be required . &quot;
the original flight was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained at the plane during the time on the plane .
&quot; from the records made available , the recordings were not clear whether the second aircraft was needed . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act provides federal states to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could inj@@ ure the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander was answered . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus on reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he tried the efforts to susp@@ end governmental rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump took an investigation in February an investigation as the Presidential plane before the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws are often leading training trips around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to set the US President in the White House with precise stones .
&quot; as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercise landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event participated in the training needs of the aircraft for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
hel@@ pers units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential supporters . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ payers were the burden for any of the other Re@@ qu@@ ites , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a speaker from Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company had not been involved with the helicopter to the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget names for the presidential system , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ce of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D Group set up for the v@@ H 3D , however , 24.@@ 380 USD per hour &apos;s drive . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ icle of the unit records the flight time of the aircraft , 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia . &quot;
the White House argued that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ payers set on the basis of estimates for the provision of measures , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the provision of equipment for DO@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract financial statements . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press release of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ies , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these weekly things that are produced in America , &quot; said Spi@@ der . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of State are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
it is of course appropriate to highlight it .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he joined his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of fire@@ works . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump talked to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and planted with the media about his own fleet of company products .

TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
top leader of the second tennis league comes at the t@@ abo@@ o of the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ We@@ iss Ne@@ uss will be in Kiel at 11 am in Kiel at the t@@ abo@@ o Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite after five games ever mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance sheet , the top of the second tennis league has received a sense of reality for the reality . &quot;
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay did respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which is always in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially at the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , mainly the imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in the double &quot; , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ es and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us as always . &quot;
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be max@@ im four .
&quot; in the moment of the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella , it does not create the Bundesliga game , which at the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c playful Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) comes to his first use during this season . &quot;
the Ch@@ il@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski and at the AT@@ P @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
&quot; in Kiel he should be like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ est@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories on Sunday last Sunday , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could again put back into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year old Hung@@ arians , who was still the number one of the j@@ uni@@ ors world championship in January 2016 , not fills someone from the trainers by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put his signature under the law to acc@@ ede the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his mast to en@@ acting the law , the Congress has wrapped up a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the US initiative . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design faces to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , since then , investors of the local O@@ MV , jointly with other European companies , are the construction of the Russian Eastern sou@@ l@@ ung Nord Stream 2 in cooperation with other European companies . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is tremendous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to come to life even per executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; has seen what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is at the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x .
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from being over . &quot;
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service ; the first received her first trailer and showed the most recent Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ h of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 @-@ Company &quot; only with more state of state and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( San Am@@ mann ) comm@@ uted the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal comes back as Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colum@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; further new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ ves@@ tre , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
&quot; back to the town , the city presents 46 dishes . &quot;
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ Mittag@@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the watch is back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over feeding the feeding supply in the urban nursery centres ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Vice @-@ leader in the Department of Youth Aid , this is good news : &quot; we all enjoyed very much . &quot;
&quot; cooked will continue except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task , and delivers fresh cooked @-@ cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the cre@@ eks area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past kit@@ ten year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , which are taken care of 45 Wo@@ ers , in the K@@ ita to mid@@ day , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour service , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have the 1st September kitchen service : they warm up the pick@@ up food , supplement them for salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tees the meal individually , give the food , and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ tro@@ op facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now stuck to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the ti@@ f@@ eit@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Educ@@ ational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of this too it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ging of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - is done in the future by a special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variation is the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service also the charm that they have turned out in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ im@@ plantation and alien@@ ation for the city as the most economical , it means the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 people in the education area at all not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women as the UN
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , official head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are run at the elections in the provinces . three women run for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections are held on April 5th .
the Taliban have posted threats against an election process which coinci@@ de with the transition from international martial arts to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be peace@@ fully passed by a democratically elected government for the first time . &quot;
Hay@@ sho@@ m said : a strong role for women is still improving the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afgh@@ an independent constitu@@ ency Commission reported that 1,2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

&quot; the hike will start on Sunday , 9th July , at 13 : 00 in Fro@@ gs . on the water reservoir in the Americ@@ an@@ ast@@ raße area . &quot;
&quot; from there it goes to the airport , until the Nat@@ ter and over the Wald@@ hof back to the water reservoir . &quot;

men try to rest 13 @-@ year girls
two young men aged 19 and 23 years old should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year girl .
&quot; according to information of the police , the men spoke the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stood with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 14.@@ 55 pm , because they wanted to telephone with the phone of the girl . &quot;
&quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old left the request , and went on with their friends . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetrators tried to grasp the mobile phone and the neck@@ lace of the girl , but not too long . &quot;
without prey the duo .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
GM@@ B concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to concentrate on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work at Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said that the company has ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products hob@@ by@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ y@@ tes of the company , the GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ A@@ tie &apos;s on to express my concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Tri@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the major Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising life of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; spokes@@ person on Pla@@ i said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ e at T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross had only yesterday received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to that , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meeting with staff and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross two months ago , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we work like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , our business continuously check , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds on our t@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operative improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ us@@ cross as a production site full and very much at all . should our business processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago from Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La Liga may be rep@@ ent of their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t be re@@ pro@@ secuted in the persecution of Ne@@ ymers , after having released a £ 18@@ 9 million in its persecution , but have warned they warned of Barcelona three years ago before the world of the world ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double of the previous brand , whereas Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past year for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way the Ne@@ ym@@ ar has imposed its way out there , although a source near the Catal@@ ans uprising , the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned of three years ago by the PS@@ G @-@ President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 , interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club , who wanted to sign the best player of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , then this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish Association expressed interest in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese seeks the police witnesses .
&quot; because he drove a car on his way to track , the driver of a VW tour had to do@@ dge and tou@@ chi@@ pped the circuit board . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the center of Stol@@ zen@@ au gave him a car on his way to the track , so that he had to do@@ dge to the right . &quot;
in doing so tou@@ ti@@ cked the Tour@@ an @-@ driver the circuit plann@@ ers .
the car was subject to harm .
&quot; the driver of the next car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued its drive without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it may be good that the Mer@@ cen@@ es@@ man did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police are now asking for the for@@ f@@ eit@@ ing of the for@@ f@@ le , as well as the driver of the urs@@ ors , derived from Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report &quot; Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of the &quot; Pope &quot; Pope George R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for abnorm@@ alities in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen continues to discuss discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by publication from the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Benedi@@ ct XVI , I. &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express its deepest regret over its own under@@ age or her at that time false estimate of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen with &quot; two things &quot; measure . &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt there is no doubt that it would have to be prevented &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions , &quot; &quot; the author in Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian , and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of lab@@ orious the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of all day experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal for normal , &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ g@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; we are happy to go on the church and this is a spot@@ ted fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; strikes a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; in order with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one was finished . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is often over . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , writes author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ ento &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report issued by the diocese of Regensburg with the Inform@@ ing attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen was sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , that by Dom@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; even with high Emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also fall more intense . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other alleg@@ ations , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the misuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was de@@ bur@@ dened by his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report about the &quot; incidents of violence exercise in patron ordered in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting image of Dom@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many pupils raise his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as an chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who became the place of the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ y was musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make yourself the trouble and reading the whole 440 pages long report from front to the back you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in that .
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of the abet@@ tor or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its efficiency .
&quot; at all , one can pre @-@ throw from it at late or not take the first hint about it seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school in which he worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as - &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also regarded a very excellent witness , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tionist and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he did not only share with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also E@@ sti@@ cking and too happy boys on the hair or ears moved , he himself has already written years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honor salvation , however , needs to be said that such educ@@ ations were widespread in the questionable period , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the acts of violence at the pre @-@ school , are the certainly bag@@ els . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself if it is not more familiar with his familiarity and role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
&quot; on Bav@@ arian Pope , many people who have never understood him are still eager . &quot;
the truth is : the report ex@@ hor@@ ted Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , the report reported a lot about abuse of the topic of abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some dec@@ eption or co @-@ knowing with regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a du@@ et substitute for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
&quot; the real problem during the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral conductors that would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
how do you evaluate Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a rus@@ hed student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which report@@ edly he had received ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely knowledge and could have been in the per@@ secutor .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , to accept that with him ... Bu@@ ben im@@ ples or clearer or more likely to have opened , than opposite their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s , instruc@@ tors , instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable .
&quot; thus the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; that , in advance , the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is related is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has to be free from any co @-@ knowledge .
&quot; it cannot be thrown out , nor may it be prevented or brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown away in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem , that in the coverage of everything mixed , he became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but that is , in turn , is a misuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there is clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the g@@ ymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence as well , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the report treats pre @-@ incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir manager . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases where l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ sts teachers were scr@@ apped and mal@@ igned and were all discour@@ aged , un@@ event@@ ful all at the pre @-@ school in Eth@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; and this is true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report says to the conclusion that &quot; many victims said the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the most part still remains to have looked after . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not involved and responsible ( as a witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again about 1993 . &quot;
saves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; he points out this point , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent progress . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as a check @-@ in in Bavaria had long been forbidden . &quot;
&quot; before that , they settled in a legal grey area , like every one of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult to estimate him where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one can also not say , he had always looked at . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the Centers of schools were officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it was unfair , to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards for the time . &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger of the past , according to today &apos;s moral principles . &quot;
since the princess has already right .
&quot; of course , this is not true of sexual abuse who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school for res@@ isting and violence on non @-@ school children , this goes far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all very aw@@ ful , and I am glad that it will finally work . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take shelter , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ rings and to pull in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his rainy season , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has been playing in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic test us also in language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI , told from his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not say that he led there a stric@@ ter rule of rule there . &quot;
&quot; but also that needs to be said : without this perfection , without this perfection , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of Wel@@ fare Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , the true culture of Europe and his musical tradition , which was right twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not even make a great singer and above all success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced in their book as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really met very well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , lively , and sav@@ ory people , from which one can not imagine that he could not see anything of a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former dom@@ sp@@ lash still today , 23 years after his em@@ bodi@@ ment , to keep in touch periodic@@ ally - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him to this day , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are today grateful to him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , father@@ ly teacher - a stringent father , certainly , that may be - but still a lovely respectable person , to which they still look even waking up and who adore them down@@ right . &quot;
&quot; and please , again , again : all that you have thro@@ ws to him are gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ation methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because it is a promin@@ ence and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ king . &quot;
&quot; the evil intention , which stands behind it , is only too apparent . &quot;
&quot; the report , which was just published , rel@@ ieve him . &quot;
&quot; now the anti @-@ year @-@ old man would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would have earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps no one would probably know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally to leave peace . &quot;
