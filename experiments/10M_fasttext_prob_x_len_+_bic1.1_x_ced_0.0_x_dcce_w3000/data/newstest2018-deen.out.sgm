<seg id="3">"a trench, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is excavated."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener for the imminent reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it's enervating, if maps are not currently up-to-date."</seg>
<seg id="7">"everybody knows everyone who had to get exciting, because the car-Navi had a green meadow instead of a walk-on street."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but it is therefore very conclusive."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork of patchwork, which one sees as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, for cities and villages were detailed maps, so-called urine sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to claims by the Bavarian Chamber administration between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your clients: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army guides occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitionalist War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical picture of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if French troops went out with the peace of Lunéville, 9 February 1801: they were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-Card."</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst max IV. Joseph drove the project further and founded the "topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Staatserization Management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositionists for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all others to find on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison glower / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after creation of the map, so 1877, as a Munich city district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Adsendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses subsendlings focus around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader in the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbers with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered Flurpieces from the so-called" Urinary "which was derived from the base tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">"today, small plots do not occupy farmers more - but small gardening of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is characterized by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 beat-place of the October, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of mental medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the document, one reads in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen, not only the street address" "at the" "Gasteig" "or from the ascent" "On the air" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt "." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse I once experienced people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich circuit-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüch."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard directed by Gudden the institution - those psychiatrists who were brought to the death of King Ludwig's II in connection with the death of King Ludwig's."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the croquettes of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had first place, later on 500 seats were enlarged."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair of 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatratrium in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the site of the former Auer Anstalt you will meet young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The medal acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth-house with an educational farm.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 they established the children-house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- in an architectural reference to the origin of the maids, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombardment."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was recorded around 1856 as" "main place", "the Kaufingstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies are outlined in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a trench from the Middle Ages were once again at the Marienhof, where these days will pre-feed and take place on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S railway line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published travel plans for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Farmers' promotion has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which is to come into force by the state, invites afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, as a number of fragmented, rents based incidents in the whole state can occur and noted here," "says it in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it harder to attract discrimination, as well as prosecutors of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to raise the time of travel, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are joined or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such an frequency which we haven't heard before.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group referred to as racist offenders against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under fragworthy circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having had no gasoline in custody during the journey by the state, having been accused of the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri in which it is shown that black drivers in the State will be 75 per cent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring cheating money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100% of hate in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting programme of FBI, which proceeds the state with regard to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the journey is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it harder to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberal Union (ACLU) had been issued on travel plans for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration law, which contribute to the local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further racial violations."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel openings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Ordination project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fiscal bacher Weidefence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-members of Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the Twendemann family, representatives of the Fisy CDU family met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his company, where he boasts 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows and as many young animals are looked after and in five apartments Feriengaeste houses."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black milk" "is for him the alternative marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regionalized.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV-president of Fisherbach, he referred to the pasturgical project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area for a lot of work, much must be edited using the Motorsense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," "Schwendemann stressed."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the parental operation, and managed this without chemical pesticides and fertilisers, even if he does not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the course of the course and is happy about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">Hope that the forestation of the areas will be gone out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are people working in agriculture and making thought about how to continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"over the course of the fence in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares which may not be reforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the population was funded, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers fall 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidefence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it does not go. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White was firm:" "the best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasturns.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR-signed subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the cheapprehensive area may not be bad (haste above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fiscal bacher Weiler Project 2018 it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a barely 16 kilometres fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes on the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans now appreciate them just like any other - therefore, the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologues of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he accepted a symbolic battle with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of Presidents to the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller is not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetty and liberty-imitators would have led him dying when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked their importance, and in particular importance that was attributed to it as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, has been added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta described:" I don't want to enter a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but how he formed it itself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemplative response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state would not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your tists, your poor, and your thanking crowds who like to breathe free, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time when the" "miserable waste" "was better visible on our screen."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed not to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict on the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict for the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - were very good that they have accomplished a highly-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by portrayed the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstractions - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant dynamic Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus, the importance of the statue changed, the people wanted to withdraw this from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist, argued for the coming of Trump, 2010, that the Statue of Liberty was not in charge, but rather an early neo-conservative, which brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here pushed onto something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely and is a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative effect of Lazarus consisted in it, to see them as they have seen from the exhaustive, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is of course not the prospect, the Miller and Trump will ever be known."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch is not meant to enlighten the path, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black commends Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two floats had belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Leichtathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member chottish competitor has made a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland they have developed something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we figure it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Leichtathletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals for candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which are to compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m route while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling that Eiliie was totally natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of Silver medallists, who is playing at the 400-m hurdles with the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 shots in the British team are."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best number to athletes from the world championship was seven who were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mediumer Muir leads to this path and has five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m walk, is another Scotsman, which you were included in a great season, winning the victory at the British team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminded himself of her first world Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannerts captain says that they are" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and in the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about this team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour to me anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose it, making it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the grottos that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech appears as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">Therefore it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it just will be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">"block critic on Facebook: don't you to get a public office, if you cannot wear the heels of voters."</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers smote him because of everything, from the interior policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped in criticism, safely."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we shall be led to the sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work out to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberal Union did not cling to him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor of the governor, sent the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counterreaction with" "Na, and?." "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican governor in a stunning democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest ranking of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary instrument to reconnect with its voters and to debate his hair-free head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockages of individuals who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is designated as officially and by employees that are paid by public tax-Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post Hogogensin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor, and argued that the blockage of comments no further than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolling or spamming people who vibrate the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and call to Hogans Catholic Faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there were no response to hate crime and other current news," wrote them in the commentary field "" The Post "." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people takes place on the same topic, then it is disregarded by some rather a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the governors" "concentrated" "spam attack, others would probably call" intercede. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a reviewer or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical particulations, and to conceal or conceal protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this is just happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials criticized for it that he implied Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the first Amendment, according to the U.S. district speaker James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they called a voter of their Facebook-Page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Prein (R) received a visit from ACLU because of its use by Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be that hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at present, Washington has had a similar effect on the internet at an affordable port."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefists hit its leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyme such as" "Juricola", "" Valerius "," "Valerius", "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and navigation with the United Kingdom, mastering his office according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have them silenced.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership does means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for comfort during the next three days, as the Renaissance Club hosted in East Lothian the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer-tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment in a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bankerage with a passion for real estate, shrunken in 2014 by a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne was not piled and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love myself in her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square footage was completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose they also commissioned the architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces overlap, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to solve the stipulation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so they were overlap, without which we had to pick up."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement allowed it to place Erfan, two rooms in full of height - with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper set of Retrouvius down via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored Goldbel, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lightning set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends there is a short corridor mirrored to let him work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the Spiess feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all cutters and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went into," explains Erfan of the steel strengthened, furnified MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so it happens if you have to push the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and improved layout."</seg>

<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if yes, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new President of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on an even less course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by porter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new President of the White House, convened on his first working day with leading employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps of White House which he repairing: poor information that fall into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow, whether on paper or in correspondence, because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to taming trump by monitoring its media thickness. "</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship on television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV-advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were persuaded", "said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February compared with Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that" "the key to hold Trumps's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter-habit ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these struggles officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more nition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience anything about the tweets that has not sent the dump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff had managed to catch some times, trouble from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"however, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump controls."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a white house, which sets up out of competitive parties, constantly attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - entirely occupied with this story - reported in May about the fondness of the consultants, the president of strategic reasons of doubtful information. "</seg>
<seg id="1408">"this was an example, which was described by porter Shane Goldmacher:"</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react as a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he will figure out from where these stem from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that happened at the end of February when someone had harmed a printed copy of an article by Gotnews, the website of the internet-provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy governor of Katie Walsh, to be the source behind a pile of his leaks" in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banished because of chcanes permanently from Twitter or that he had no concrete evidence, or that he voiced wrong accusations in the past and revoke them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then President Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">"Kelly tried three months later, the same."</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his consultants are still striving to influence."</seg>

<seg id="1797">"the lavender is reminding of the insects in drought and because of the disease-borne insects, which are trying to find solutions that are preparing to find solutions."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute, CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and fall much more in autumn. "</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small ornamade, a microbacterium that carries the dwarf-calves, and with very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil lures not only for vacationers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long plant tubes having a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>
<seg id="1804">"so, we have fewer parts with ethereal oil."</seg>
<seg id="1805">"among the solutions that are being considered, include better water distribution and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also the proven mixture of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of sorts, which are more resistant to dry."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime; corrupt officials and ceaseless drug war.</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"discuss two high-level journalists, which feels safer: they should take their children with the office, which were the destination of an attack with shells, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table in the front of the space: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest period of violence, and throughout the country the corpses, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have been in office in December 2012. 589 are on attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there was at least seven dead in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"under the latter, her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the Co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deep felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, who shows his midfinger with the word" Justice, "t T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been a Sonata-Federal Prosecutor's Office, in order to deal with the cases of journalists, it has started in accordance with the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murder that are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uneven and even though the terrain is still oblique."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "Twelve river." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to walk in Culiacan around freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest over the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival groups struggle here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of the two-story moles of drugs, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace, "if only a cartel that has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected Gangmembers bought each copy of the issue as soon as they delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper which had released the same story to leave the land to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived our friends and colleagues for so long that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was active in 2003 as a senior reporter for Noroeste, when he joined with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the rudote problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"in time, the paper has earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and the sales and advertising took."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"they loved to publish hard-looking investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez, Valdez, won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, where ever she has led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave me voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in the past October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take over the task that will assign you as a journalist - either that, or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on? "</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spawn bird, who was like a dockers, the friend, who knew generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted out on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayas, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask them: was his love for routine his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has compelled them to question their own assumptions on how to do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homestart and long-strips, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are not in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees met by Riodoce to security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days previously announced that Spyware, which is sold solely to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen receive protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-scale district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters were questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who signed the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the Berglist, where the drug persons are facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exit to the government spending, focused on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the Office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, the governing Institutional Social Democratic Party (Pri), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of highly toxic cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this eatery including a one who escaped a son of "El Chapo" Guzman.</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months before, the reader had viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been devoted to storage space for signs and stickers, which are opposed to the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they had ever expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Repork Miriam Ramirez away a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials saying, based on DNA testing that it is to be."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become stronger by acting in organized protests" SOS Press "on walkway and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director of Bojorquez is in Washington and tried to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities, to pronounce journalists, and to release them, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has therefore asked for her to be re-classified by the government, because she is concerned that her anger does hurt her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico had organised crime, organised by governmental officials and a concurrent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco journalism", "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug persons but also on behalf of politicians and security forces, organized with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" "Articulo 19" "took over half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico-minded you, because they want you keep the mouth shut," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">"nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamarlipas, six years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that supposedly was signed by the Zetas box:" "I am here for my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computerisation and earphones in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslav Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others do continue how El Manana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004 did.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez directed publicly to the drug cartels with an editorial page on the title page with the title" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have escaped from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, like the photographer Ruben Espinosa, born in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay back and continue the work, there is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, indicates that the drug stores it scares him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I was reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, as at once all their phones began to spread."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shotings with bandages and security forces in the proximity of the swimming pool Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed Tote.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the board edge you have released the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heels nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez had a look at the policemen, the guards held to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid of all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose finger-finger was visible for quite ualoa, the staff of Riodoce attracted its traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only remember," said Bojorquez, "" if on the same day she was murdered, the trainee asked me to send them to the road. "</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soak his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue as well as a startling.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable nasal horn of a Canadian mountain workers were so well received, that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that she could even notice that his gful skin was of reddish Braun - and they said they could have had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "referred him as" the rowing, armored dinosaurs, which has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period before 110 million and 112 million years."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preservative condition has researchers who describe it as" truly remarkable ","</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast inside the 2,500 Pound (1,100 kg) of heavy oil."</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only flashes a little over the eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the science story as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs specimens - the mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although he is covered with armor and a changing tank, probably threatened by meat and send dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a parachutification that is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it is threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier did the first time headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta marked with the Museumsteelta Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen had made it possible to record Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists that document patterns and form of scales and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shying, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shalloy is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is far exceeds that of the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressure by the flesh of the dinosaur dinosaurs that favored the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that apply counter-shying - think of deer, zebras or watchers - are much smaller and hurting than prey, which signaled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs-predators of the Cretaceous must have been" "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs is reddish.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his conserved intestine, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as the South of South today, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks like almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much fantasy to use to reconstruct it. if you only have a little bit with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretacetime was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"though the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, was hunted the armored dinosaurs of some of his furious ancestor."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthrasrus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavier monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the professional journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta versoul after death in the sea and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"creature was found by Shawn Funk, as he was on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the rowing-armored dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tips given by its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters has been shaken by the western Canada, until a flooding river it was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater of the dinosaurs kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains even hollowed Panzeroes along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy panels that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forter is on his side, his five fingers are tightened up."</seg>

<seg id="1977">It stands for light to medium-sized injuries and said a polizeal preacher.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large overlap on bailship vehicles was at the accident.</seg>

<seg id="1986">German railways: group testet "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everybody has experienced this: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1999">"to use this, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers are doing already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to have bought it via the app, the DB navigator app, which anyway is the most convenient way of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservations.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" Comfort Check-in "works as follows: one climbs to the train, calling his ticket to" My Tickets "." "</seg>
<seg id="2004">"if you test the test, then a button becomes the electronic devaluation."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train guides get on their mobile devices a message that driver's X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"comes the train guide at the ticket control to seat Y, he knows that there is a passenger sitting with already entless online ticket."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets"?</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell got shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street," "said it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because nobody else had mastered the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ Theepharoah was continually saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, a non-weapon black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed to tweet live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He poised a picture of omwns leblonaked body that was spread out on the street and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild", "thought Ferrell at himself."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweet on people at the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, crying, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">You watched a live feeder when a policeman was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that secured another policeman is his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... animals all. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," he remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have used to ourselves and which we can call you typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock she fetched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," whose Streets "," in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which is from the point of view of human beings who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter, who took a floral dress and a suitable crown, she bespoke the two a conversation that they had countless times in this morning over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and put it up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in whom they personally have not experienced racism, she is no different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South of Floryant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camparea as the activists representing the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and halves to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to accept shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9, she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in Organize.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all came. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan evening, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to just document what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to my profession:" "do you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white men - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area who is known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his dedication brought the project closer together, together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets "?" in the years after Browns. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to concentrate on Ferrabover experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but rather a community who cometh together," "Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, the documents of" Whose Streets show "" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrer's life, how she loves himself and marries her wife. "</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability at this work and in the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrer's history repeatedly give the role of black gay women in the broader Black-lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, which have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayled by Martin in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in managerial positions have borne the movement altogether," "Ferrell," "and therefore we are continually fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to noticing that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it consists of that" this is no affirmatism type of action, "in the Ferrell due to its identity as the heart of the movie."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front front because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area which she calls her home: "a mess.</seg>
<seg id="2083">"yet it complained to a chant and she feels bound to this memory, since she went into Ferguson the streets three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support them.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"" "dream" "to" "scale" ": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery"</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south-edge of the pedestrian precinct has been dividing the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the topic very little.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed on our Facebook-Page "People's freund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"for one to say in the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "" (Anja Becker) or "" This would be genuine "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "" does not need a person "" (Siggi Betzen) or quite plain: "" magnitude "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates can build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which the other businesses will benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precepts."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market hall is standing, in the 13 marketers market their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">The start of construction will be at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building, namely the Beda Square, with the possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always love to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop was discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would wish that even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" whether direct market entry in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of the rent. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is likely to be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping's Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"if clothes, shoes, drugor and supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"of this, there are already enough in our city."</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many charges are still empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not yet another weekly market, it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered are offered fresh, is largely offered directly from the producer and is obscant inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop transactions are reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies, as the rent rents are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special transactions there is almost no more and that which is still left, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Mainly: where should the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it already create the specter-gallery in advance, all shops in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply does not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, does not need any one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmers market hall, it is thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg is no more space."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible, hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarcuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the earlier Secret Analyst has released a 35-year prison sentence after they made public messages about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, says A Becoming resemblance (one matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Deady-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Deady-Hagborg has been extracted through the algorithms analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as some intellectual comment not only about the formation of DNA-data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the indurent determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has spoken openly about the identity as a woman, has been condemned for 20 accages, including six breaches of the esspas law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a baskets, black-white selfishy, in which Manning is visibly sitting on a driver and a platter-blonde is associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Deady-Hagborg started with the great success of her 2012-Project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it, the Artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigar sleeves and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Deady-Hagborg with a press show at the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated Muse were exchanged at the same time, several letters exchanged during the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of the Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" "Suppressed Images" "which would foresee a future in which the President Chelation would convert the verdict and it was able to personally see the exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military strike in Kansas was a welcome type of happy encounter."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat downward and arctic, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweaked ways, which he should actually fix, continue to dispose."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Deady-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a wall written on the wall of the gallery called Manning with her oversized signature beneath (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation which were based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall their mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thousandal of Cs, and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">Deady-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) to show how amazing similarly, at least in biological terms, we all are. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Deady-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own space is a page from the above mentioned comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a free-hand efon in the hand from the disciplinarchy of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they address your speech, then they won" "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so do never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist who greeted out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it should be foreseen in the comic book - but when they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacrum which gather together as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where its genetic Haplogks were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowds," said Deady-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement who formed a Chelsea, like the movement, which also hidden behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that in 2017 there may be no more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeried professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said to the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern ropes have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin, which feels warm up - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs" "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot about the form of breast-warts up to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still worrying, as many robots have the" personalities "that have a Stepford-woman be progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern ropes have become robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the real Botix robot allows the users to adapt their robots to properties such as relapse."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapsing and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "blackness the website of True."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day they have their moods over the course of the day - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, to be fixed on conversation or can" "be" "in mood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties, the aggressions on rape, if you go one step on Frigid (says here: ressing) Farrah is, bedefinitely one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Hxxxy witha vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it is stated on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, this sex-robots are not just a fairy or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and its increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal for gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men are naturally not going to hold a sex robot, and while the FRR noted its rising popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what oozes out of the edge-areas can be in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market gives the permission for this."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is yet some overlapping that this highly developed sex robot appears in a time that the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has praising women sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterest aspect of television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures, the hidden body and the spread-off eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders want them to feel humane, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot walk or move away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing, which implies independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammation of any disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects some 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causes stomach fights and rannons, recurrent, or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected is normally advised to avoid flesh and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the intestine to make sure that damaging microbes, which hide in the food not to penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of releasing inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the equilibrium gets too far towards inflammation, it can result from a inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, a type of tolerance-promoting immuncell is found in mice, which carry a specific bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tracyptophan - one of proteins - to detach the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflamed intestinal epithelium, if the same system also plays with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that had the tolerance, when she found out that a group of academic powers had such cells, but another group of the same trunk that had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the dups of the mice were found DNA sequential and were found six bacterial species, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without lack of mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria carried out on the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then resulted in small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"the active component from the liquid has been cleansed, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan-Metabolism, known as the Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the fodder of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptopmost values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us have reuteri in our stomach-intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-based products from L. reuteri develop these cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, since these cells are inflammations based on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophangar can lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report" Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of the "Pope" Pope George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for abnormalities in the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to discuss discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissenator, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "explained by publication from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Benedict XVI, I."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express its deepest regret over its own underage or her at that time false estimate of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano" "criticized that in reporting on violence at the Domspatzen with" two things "measure."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt there is no doubt that it would have to be prevented" shameful and shameful actions, "" the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historian, and member of the national Italian bioethics committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of laborious the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of all day experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal for normal," "writes Scargia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk" "interview:" "we are happy to go on the church and this is a spotted frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth," "strikes a very normal pedagogical means" "in order with cheeky children as I was one was finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger is often over."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, writes author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored with Ratzinger the memento" "My brother of Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report issued by the diocese of Regensburg with the Informing attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abuses."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, that by Domcapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even with high Emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also fall more intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other allegations, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the misuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was deburdened by his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-pages report about the" incidents of violence exercise in patron ordered in the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a conflicting image of Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many pupils raise his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as an choleriker and perfectionist who became the place of the Öfteren when a Domspy was musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make yourself the trouble and reading the whole 440 pages long report from front to the back you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in that.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the abettor or co-knowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of violence at the pre-school occurred outside of its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at all, one can pre-throw from it at late or not take the first hint about it seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school in which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as -" redemption "," "Heaven" "and" "better world." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"also the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also regarded a very excellent witness," "sincerely," "honest," "honest," "honest," "honest," "honest," "honest," "sincere," and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionist and his high emotionality, which also led to Wutches."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only share with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also Esticking and too happy boys on the hair or ears moved, he himself has already written years ago, deeply regrets and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honor salvation, however, needs to be said that such educations were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the acts of violence at the pre-school, are the certainly bagels."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself if it is not more familiar with his familiarity and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on Bavarian Pope, many people who have never understood him are still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report exhorted Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report reported a lot about abuse of the topic of abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some deception or co-knowing with regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to speak with my father or mother about it," "said a duet substitute for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem during the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral conductors that would have been a colleague of the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you evaluate Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a rushed student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which reportedly he had received (Georg Ratzinger) timely knowledge and could have been in the persecutor.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, to accept that with him... Buben imples or clearer or more likely to have opened, than opposite their parents, internats, instructors, instructors, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to the very clear outcome:" that, in advance, the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is related is Georg Ratzinger has to be free from any co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"it cannot be thrown out, nor may it be prevented or brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was a lot of" "violence" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was thrown away in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem, that in the coverage of everything mixed, he became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but that is, in turn, is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is clean separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"moreover, the report treats pre-incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir manager."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases where lad of sadists teachers were scrapped and maligned and were all discouraged, uneventful all at the pre-school in Ethterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzenging school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic" "preschool" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzenging school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but not a sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this is true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report says to the conclusion that" many victims said the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, the most part still remains to have looked after."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not involved and responsible (as a witness) had nothing to hear, and then again about 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Saves Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the DomspatzengGymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"he points out this point," that in the pre-school the test will continue to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent progress."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as a check-in in Bavaria had long been forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they settled in a legal grey area, like every one of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult to estimate him where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one can also not say, he had always looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the Centers of schools were officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it was unfair, to apply today's pedagogical standards for the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "thus the danger of the past, according to today's moral principles."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this is not true of sexual abuse who was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school for resisting and violence on non-school children, this goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all very awful, and I am glad that it will finally work."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take shelter, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so earrings and to pull in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his rainy season, Georg Ratzinger has been playing in the talks with you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test us also in language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI, told from his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not say that he led there a stricter rule of rule there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also that needs to be said: without this perfection, without this perfection, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of Welfare Domspatzen, the true culture of Europe and his musical tradition, which was right twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not even make a great singer and above all success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced in their book as Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, Georg Ratzinger really met very well and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, lively, and savory people, from which one can not imagine that he could not see anything of a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former domsplash still today, 23 years after his embodiment, to keep in touch periodically - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but still a lovely respectable person, to which they still look even waking up and who adore them downright."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again, again: all that you have throws to him are guardianation methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because it is a prominence and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sinking."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intention, which stands behind it, is only too apparent."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just published, relieve him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the anti-year-old man would have acquired a 93-year-old man who would have earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave peace."</seg>
