Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
this is clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
I am always plug@@ ged in drawers or ho@@ unds from outside label who mostly have little to do with me and the reality .
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; at the most ad@@ orable the act@@ ress spends her time at home , a television with lo@@ cker D@@ utt and Mexican food , said it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for white gl@@ ut they bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we need women not to be married or have children to be totally &quot; , &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - love is not a children &apos;s game &quot; is An@@ iston as a single mother to see two sons .
the film works with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger searched with some colleagues a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled at their end of the evening , they hun@@ ted in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the feed dr@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I have had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and I ended the riding career as well .
on Saturday German was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament si@@ ege - again close to horses .
&quot; he let himself run with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse , he didn &apos;t even get a photo for photo . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was very convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe exceeded the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
at awards it lacks the sympathetic athle@@ te .
&quot; federal agencies , silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already se@@ ated him .
he is the 18th award @-@ winners of the sport pyramid .
at Aachen he met the first prize for Hans GÃ¼nter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporty successes but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades long Lan@@ ger fo@@ sters the offspring .
&quot; and so , he was also the price of the prize of 25.000 Euro further . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold sports@@ men was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Fe@@ ner E@@ ber@@ hard Gi@@ ve , the Fe@@ el Corn@@ elia , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ ve Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ bos@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men have come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part the illustr@@ ative company went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger stopped in distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ &apos;s and Tr@@ umps policy compared to : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both the Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policies between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
&quot; the , on the role of the state . &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and be warned of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wanted to put the economy to death and regulate them to death he says .
&quot; himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return to regulations , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax approaches - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the contrary , says : the State has certain tasks to fulfil ; he has a disadvantage for it and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore the taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton have almost wor@@ dless . &quot;
democratic evaluation at all announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wings of Re@@ public@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump you might still be in internal discussions .
&quot; more clearly , the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident . &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and drive coal mining in the US again .
oil funding should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demands renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of Clean Energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US want to isolate not from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better then , for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
she wants to raise her up to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , which wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , so the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to at least demand from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who alone flee , almost always to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers a refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
&quot; each one has a baby , that is a maximum of one year old . &quot;
one laid her little son in the arm .
he looked at the room with great eyes curious into the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are swe@@ pt .
they live in Munich &apos;s North in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for all @-@ lying women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the set up , together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Women &apos;s Aid Association . &quot;
long ago it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here on their escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically per@@ secuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families want to send them to Europe as hop@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in women ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh other reasons for the run : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honorary pat@@ ron@@ age , slavery or obs@@ essive pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving it away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs are demanding for example for a bottle of water a sexual act , is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , be re@@ born . &quot;
even here the women @-@ related women in refugee shel@@ ters are often considered inferior and worst if ab@@ used .
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in Munich &apos;s North in Munich , are traumati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women were so accustomed to nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experiences , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; because they often don &apos;t help themselves , they need more accommodations only for them , calls for danger . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven District Apostles are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , some answer with No . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are such a thing in shel@@ ters of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben are not accommodated alone , women @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ er and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common floors or own homes just for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study that has been published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or women are absent , there may be more constant violence against women . &quot;
&quot; all the wash@@ rooms should be separately accessible and easily accessible for women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel in need of this protective need , you can read the cr@@ ush that there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has been talking about that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new work measures
members of Bashar al practitioners have called on their union to denoun@@ ce new labour measures in their disputes relating to a new contract .
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) , the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded the entire Council , from the beginning of September more work@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said , &quot; &quot; that the Minister of Ministers had agreed to respond to the concerns concerning the contract . &quot;
general practitioners and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract which was agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently quiet &quot; to have problems which resulted in the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC executive committee voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and calls up official new negotiations with all your needs . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today provided an formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a run program of escal@@ ating work measures , which begins early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to this fact that Ass@@ istenz@@ ath in this year were six@@ ties , the first total incidents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of BM@@ A Ass@@ ist Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to the rejection of the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings , which was still before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with that the Treaty should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; alliance of foreign side &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met in Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish bac@@ th in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in receipt , I cannot rep@@ el the expression that Ankara wants to say this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile had a mal@@ ignant , and he shining barely warmth , even for his with@@ standing relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day described a newspaper , that Erdo@@ gan was so doing so as if never wanted to happen . &quot;
seemed to me his enthusiasm rather to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin ex@@ hilar@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory courses at the border of a Russian fighter ship at the Syrian border . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ alled .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to have fallen back to Russia in his back .
the decay was even bigger as it was committed by a alleged friend .
it is difficult to rebuild the c@@ ousin if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the stat@@ ely controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time the Turks seemed to blame for everything .
&quot; most serious officials were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting was only held because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erdo@@ gan whom he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a sort of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends who he can get after he was reli@@ eved at a failed coup in the last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be easier when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
these are counting on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week projected the cou@@ tries to see cheap fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate it : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as the reaction to the tried to take power over a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing Gro@@ ll is about the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian President in Ankara won a bonus for him to have demanded support for the elected government bodies after the attempted coup . &quot;
this is well @-@ remembered for Moscow - a matter of course that has changed a deep @-@ sitting fear of reg@@ iment .
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed it to represent Russia and Turkey , one , as it once described a analy@@ st , &quot; &quot; alliance of outer side@@ ways &quot; : two countries , who are ch@@ aired from West and poorly treated and now dis@@ connecting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given itself the role of a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey can support contradic@@ tory pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talk , both Presidents said at the press conference , they had not even ro@@ ams the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey critic@@ ised it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress them . &quot;
there is no un@@ ambiguous consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator to Syria can be found .
&quot; however , after months of open hos@@ tilities - and given the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least been talking again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the R@@ BS , the R@@ BS trademark is said to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the management of the Bank . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were connected with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since stand@@ off@@ ish itself when she had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; at this time we used br@@ ate@@ gen &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; , &quot; other end @-@ consumer finance marks . &quot;
they supported the international sport with a million pounds of sponsorship by the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to move more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales every RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized Head@@ quarters and the IP@@ not@@ ing are to change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the private client business , which will receive more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; I say now that we are not pursuing global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
&quot; R@@ BS has already noted that it will be its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing no longer continued , and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in its sport sponsorship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop ourselves to the bank of the brands , as we focus ourselves in the interior ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal before three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our clients and launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can lan@@ der these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached its 3.@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sp@@ illed champagne after a double by New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize . &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit in New@@ market .
&quot; he put on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction that is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ etr@@ ack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the Six@@ th Jo@@ ckey , who reaches milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ e , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ old winner D@@ ett@@ ori who gained in front of G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy that it happened in New@@ market , because I &apos;m here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ quet Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the j@@ ubil@@ ation to catch the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the hin@@ ge race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey between the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone just a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enthusiastic for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie in a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already gotten 6,000 profits , if he would not only be a weekend and GroÃ@@ tur@@ ni@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has been in UK almost 30 years winner what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Fl@@ ying Fin@@ ishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British flats for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
&quot; a number of major tournaments win , including its famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ ingly Si@@ eben &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its existence . &quot;
and he is not yet in the end - D@@ ett@@ ori previously said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin captiv@@ ated President Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his deputy President Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s has been arranged by his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was deputy chairman since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the renowned National Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
it is stated on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website ( in Russian ) that he later was a director and director of the government .
his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as a state of state and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest conspir@@ e Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as governor he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the governor has returned to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , there are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power @-@ fighting ?
this is what no one knows .
but the official alleg@@ ation - that a man who once was appointed as potential President to once lead to Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks about Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - one could almost say - trusting positions for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was deputy prime minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin &apos;s former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted . &quot;
once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term put@@ ted against the Constitution .
&quot; this post was taken by another , next ally Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the Â£ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four en@@ closure of the &quot; &quot; cover &quot; , &quot; which is completion around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 s@@ lan@@ g@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
the Â£ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; in fact , the economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown endorsed the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of engineers from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity , which require extremely precise tolerance for fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of nearly 79 % of the total bridge doors in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks , today gets a Bet@@ ong@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ th for the Deck , which means the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the closure of future @-@ oriented high@@ - and deep @-@ building represents .
&quot; after installing the last street section and its connection with the northern section of the North West , we had to conclude the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern hemisphere at 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , about 6,000 tons and at a slope of about 3 % had to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; mar@@ g@@ ust , as the toler@@ ances which the team is working , they were tiny -- on each page they bore only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; to be alive after they were fro@@ sted by their fishing boat before fro@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station took place on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulty going to swim with certainty , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat revol@@ ved around him and put the worst in front of us , &quot; &quot; said the head of the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds used the boat from their reach , until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man were exhausted from 60 exhausted , while the third man was found at the age of 60 . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast of the coast and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; The three men who were cast into the water are fortunate to be un@@ har@@ med and alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ ar has an emergency con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , however , this sol@@ ves , however , at the k@@ ern@@ ers of the bot from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has master@@ ed today about these men .
heavy injured - man sti@@ cking on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday evening , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the in@@ stig@@ ated of the alcoholic and the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when he came to the apartment , he went twice to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ old @-@ old was injured by the hand and in the body .
the police could establish the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 years old , the clothes of his ex @-@ friend were destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this aler@@ ships as a result of his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
&quot; however , she could not move it to leave the apartment . &quot;
and so she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street she met her husband &apos;s ex @-@ mate .
&quot; when the two women played the apartment again , the fifty @-@ year @-@ old was his sister to his side and attacked his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and the Green Party mean a lot more strongly in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschwei@@ g will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; to the next grid . &quot;
but argument is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is lacking so far .
&quot; SPD group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas in future , must show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock market . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the Town Hall is , however , &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors , who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments build as social housing as possible . &quot;
&quot; a new urban construction programme , which will cost millions of cost and is still financed , is intended to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants to be tougher for investors .
&quot; regardless of it , as viol@@ a , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the concept of action is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; the program does not yet completely exist : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does it balances the loss of other about 1300 apartments , which will run out in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , such as the plann@@ ers spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought ongoing ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get back to the prices back again . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
one fell on a blow to solve the problem .
&quot; because in the Western cities , for the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price of cheap apartments there . &quot;
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the residential construction companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west of the West is dramatically increasing , the aim of the so @-@ called inter@@ mixing . &quot;
there is no more to give a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Greens expect that there will be even more movement in the discussion . &quot;
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must enter into the boat . &quot;
&quot; although , I concentrated on more construction sites for family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; that teenagers and child are no longer going to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ em@@ on go , it is about to take people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities cannot be mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , which were first created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later they came from a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand was something in the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries has been moved by massive demand that over@@ bur@@ sts the server .
within a few days Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go more users had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone in the outside and look for Pok@@ Ã©@@ mons to be followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( on a scre@@ enshot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped on the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5.000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people , each day spent 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company does not know who plays Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement . &quot;
&quot; many public opinion campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages to health are boring and coming from people the miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport regularly , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the miracle full of Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close friends on the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there is also mur@@ der@@ ous game @-@ corruption , who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should I say ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be added with time .
&quot; however , because of Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and helping many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es manages gold in the dam
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ans .
&quot; the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Tur@@ ner kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ battle title , and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games . &quot;
their total result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the Silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; - Mann@@ es@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ cer Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ers on the Swedish head during the single majority of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and a total of the fifth , while holding their reputation , the best of their generation , or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears earlier than her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end .
&quot; this success represents them in the same League as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought about their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years of its sports@@ art , 15 World medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ans from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton of her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting her last test in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t get so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of excessive expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace themselves after they won gold and silver in the single majority of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal at the Tuesday , while at the farewell party who retired on the farewell team , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a pro@@ fi@@ ery sign . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es ins@@ isted while being on top of the top , never the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their land exercises - which includes their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music which would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who has been adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans Mother during a school escape , in the Bo@@ or@@ man tra@@ vers@@ ed , became the power . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , no extra competition has lost over since the summer of 2013 , a strainer that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two h@@ ubs , dec@@ ep@@ ored the picture . &quot;
Sweden and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World title - lou@@ dly .
she took up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and he sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently when she anticipated its end@@ ous - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears in Bil@@ es sparkling red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner as the vision they once described in their collection book . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medals went up in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old cre@@ ws were called by the Americans &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their soil exercise , they cast out to the public of Kus@@ ad@@ st@@ alls , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared without doubt . &quot;
&quot; as for as it affects , the speed of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass @-@ inf@@ estation at the music hearing shot in the car
&quot; according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl came shot in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first series of mass attacks , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12th while the car was parked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the cul@@ pr@@ un@@ ed eight shots from a hand@@ fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with the fact that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder did not have been the result of a rob@@ ber , as the att@@ acker did not join the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said , that the sh@@ ur@@ ch@@ craft led the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; overall , mainly in h@@ isp@@ anic urban@@ ization within four months were killed seven people and two others injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , distributed Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ator refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to its violations and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still in the spot . &quot;
a witness of the police with the fact that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a par@@ ted car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the sliding , which was upon an empty pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ Ã¼l@@ sen , and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys , and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; however , as the least of his Alter@@ enjoyed Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy nothing knew . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time was my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I do not create that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left them on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund will never recognize them under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proved to be institution@@ alized .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of aid .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor cra@@ wl up to his third year of life . he can still not speak .
but it is making progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character of the strings &quot; Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we will introduce him string , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as for Ed@@ mund as well as infection with viruses such as Mas@@ ers or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus coron@@ ation .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional price of a certain future .
&quot; I asked constantly , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know it really .
&quot; I have not asked for a long time after the prognosis , because I do not expect they really can tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainf@@ alls , floods gives rise to rescue operations in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana st@@ aves the governor on Friday the emergency spot . it will be calculated all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the crest flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ all , reported the national weather service . &quot;
&quot; the Governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards , told that officials in constant contact with local authorities and local authorities have already been on the move . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ation of the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the church had called Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used across large parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
weather service allowed to fall in this area additional 3 to 5 inches to rain .
&quot; in the south of Alab@@ ama , on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ early @-@ war@@ n@@ System was used , while in the area Mobile continue to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will reach all probability for over the weekend to record high@@ lands . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ding many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream of floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these streams can only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Mississippi River in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue team still sli@@ pped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , which rose greatly overnight . &quot;
he said that he would have warned him another step@@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it finished my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Han@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , in which she lived there , never had seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ fer could have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Glo@@ ster where they were accommodated up to Friday .
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods began to spread rapidly , since there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and , that the authorities have been considering Ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inch of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil is considerable due to the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .

&quot; the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the Municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said , that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed from the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were decorated to host the evac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water begins to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dirt roads were closed due to the flood of water and sand@@ bags provided for residents to take care which hope to keep the water from their homes and businesses . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in a hit the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys had to rain it on the Gulf Coast .
&quot; according to his indications a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday there have been no un@@ reported . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ vor in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave that Brown suffered multiple instruments , including in the lungs , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was per@@ ched by balls , his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z distributed to the transmitter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo a number of operations .
the boy of the boy shared the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people that were shot in German@@ town .
likewise three men were killed : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported on the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined whether under one of the last men of the perpetrators could be found .
investig@@ ator distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a crus@@ ade between several guns .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ sle@@ eves for the no@@ stri@@ des , which were re@@ pro@@ secuted to various no@@ stri@@ des , se@@ wn the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly tra@@ ded to a continuous struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the trail , were sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters here , which were very active involved , &quot; police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia with the sender . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were made in the area .
&quot; there came to no feast , and the police are currently checking the surveillance video . &quot;
another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was met by a squee@@ ze on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police are still looking for an susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine among the women &apos;s Olympic Games in Tur@@ ning and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been part of the summer Olympi@@ ad since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the JÃ¼@@ dine is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is ca@@ tho@@ lic , off , makes every prou@@ dly . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has solidi@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport @-@ type .
in the last four years the number one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ ers was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is showing strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas seen a surprising Olympic Games in America for the last Olympic Games of the Olympic Games .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she expected unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routine . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , who won gold at an individual majority event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we do not experience the top of this sport , but do not look for the classes in the whole country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie shows all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic Board will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ers in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ning a more expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner first and foremost in private turn@@ around which can be maintained by parents who pay for the training , interior , travel and hotel cost ( for the coach and their tur@@ ers and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs to support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the Tur@@ ner will receive its entire training and this is a long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ er of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes , since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired by the con@@ gregations of innumerable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , offer a high @-@ level and easier access training . &quot;
I founded my athle@@ tic Foundation for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) , to offer the youth of high @-@ quality Tur@@ ning , who earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports type . &quot;
&quot; exercising develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers viable advantages for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to care for the tur@@ bo and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team captain and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background motivated to become their way to begin healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
general practitioners would like to organize more strikes after they rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to stop the dispute over the changes caused by adopting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7@@ ,000 def@@ endants who voted for a vote . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t plans un@@ veiled plans to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS had commanded in a &quot; &quot; no em@@ and@@ land &quot; &quot; and would be harmful any further delay to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance agencies are supposed to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night @-@ night and weekly workers to improve care of the ast@@ ounding movement . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Kom@@ itter for Ass@@ ist practitioners last night in a communication with : &quot; Ass@@ istenz@@ ologists have concluded serious concerns , especially that it is the current occupancy crisis and administered them to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; for only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time goes out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve disputes through talks should take part in the government for the sake of involvement and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; that was what happened to be an accident , Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had made it last month that his door would always be up again . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t must act now to lift up the condition and address the worries of the assistance agencies .
&quot; if he did not do this , we have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists have been involved to grant doctors on the strip @-@ mail cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute concerning the changes caused by adopting the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to pay a better wave wage payment for the 5@@ 4,000 assistant who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged to end the assistance agencies to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labour @-@ actions achieve nothing of only little but ou@@ sting teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing staff and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we have spoken to the compromise with the health professionals and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries positively to the concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility for training , training courses , training , training , and health education , such as Ernst , the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the observ@@ ance of agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May were . &quot;
the Â£ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication to reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a Â£ 2 @-@ per day drug after suggested by the authorities to admin@@ ister this more people for a longer period of time .
the net@@ ting drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a her@@ edi@@ ary .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke rate or a further cardi@@ ac ar@@ ctic . &quot;
the Reg@@ ul@@ ators N@@ ICE of N@@ HS is recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the Reg@@ ul@@ ators N@@ ICE of N@@ HS is recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of which suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke cases are caused by accum@@ ulations fet@@ al material in the arteries that form har@@ row .
&quot; when the t@@ ag breaks apart , it can cause a blood flow that is hidden from blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood flow and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is driven by the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ probable . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE health @-@ technology evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , have a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing more heart attack and stro@@ kes with people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; thanks to the provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand the available treatment options to thousands of people , who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the accus@@ ation is not recommended for treatment that amounts over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ur leaves voting in Muslim areas flour@@ ish
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on release of a government report for corruption from the office
&quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ en has led to this , that widespread Elec@@ tives was ignor@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities , such as a crus@@ hing governmental report today . &quot;
&quot; the former head of Sir Eric Pick@@ les under@@ takes the police , electoral observing and Rath@@ geber to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ otic and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who now is a pro@@ corrupt , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters of religious motives would be so bad , that the police should be allowed to set out bul@@ locks outside of the cabins , to protect tax@@ able voters . &quot;
&quot; he suggests that voters should lead a pass , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must name only its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not distant ink to wear on the finger of a person when she authori@@ ze their vote to avoid that someone is chosen twice . &quot;
wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to the municipal and decisions of non @-@ official comp@@ iling or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves electoral fraud , but is also said to protect the municipal government before the wider cor@@ rup@@ tions and financial &apos; culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ toral College in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special Court decided that the official Mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ ed on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of its Muslim community &quot; &quot; zy@@ got@@ hic style &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with apartheid and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should have led to &quot; his campaign on the basis , that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which a person chooses as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; in particular , he was particularly alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent brie@@ fing - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the filling out , to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , particularly communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ tic or ban@@ a. background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns ... state institutions such behaviour have ignored such behaviour based on &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ otic and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition , that political activ@@ ations should be editing to &quot; &quot; harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also harder registration measures to prevent the voting directory to import and welfare purposes . &quot;
options to consider voters before choosing to ask for your ID .
&quot; not remot@@ ely use ink on the finger of a person , once she has given her voice to prevent someone who chooses twice . &quot;
systematic check@@ ups on the nationality of a person to perform to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on moti@@ ons on a automatic envelope .
ban that political activ@@ ates full local elections and envel@@ opes of stamp elections .
the police give authority to set out bul@@ ations around election stations .
a legislative change that facilitated an indictment for intimi@@ dation in accordance with the &quot; representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act of 1983 ) .
photography offered in election stations .
&quot; requirement that only English in the election stations must be used ( with the exception of Wales ) . &quot;
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees usually assert that voters go into the cabins . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no punishment was placed . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Justice has explained Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy for the purification of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
it was largely unknown due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ efficient &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the Elec@@ tional divisions of the Town Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the judgement Tower in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country , as the mother of the parliaments , has a proud legacy , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double @-@ Bi@@ ck@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ i in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio this week has got over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot besides br@@ ink and band who has proved to be impressive two @-@ predec@@ essors in the Her@@ zo@@ gin from Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ ans is by far not the only one for the gold fighter athle@@ te , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger - at least not if you should believe in social media . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ ouring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ck@@ ate at the time on our screen , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ oni@@ ks that have more than just a certain similarity with Hol@@ ly@@ rical fields . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o &quot;
&quot; except for the cycle of the cycle , many people on the Internet have been transferred to the Internet like a certain arch@@ ing of the Twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
the team member of the US team at ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star un@@ secretly alike .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity in the social media with and gave to that he has been hearing since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no great similarity , except the facial hair , shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I missed the well as compliments . &quot;
one of the most popular Compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the center : the emerging similarity between the British Weit@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes is to be able to walk through the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an for the Cub@@ an American singer . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star F@@ rison .
one gear higher : this user is that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett that shows similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian Silver med@@ all@@ ists in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ rounded skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : one Twitter user was very happy about that others are the similarities too .
&quot; put theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US @-@ football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular Compar@@ ison St@@ sh Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who shows her own beautiful , broad sm@@ iles , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the network also ap@@ plau@@ ded quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it will be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
yesterday night we quickly apologi@@ zed with our viewers on broadcast and Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a miserable wording . B@@ yron is doing what he has said . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify its observation by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the female sco@@ oter in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ as , he said . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark indi@@ gn@@ ant about woman who wear under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman pulled off their clothes in the middle of a row to sample sub@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered them as she saw in it , she pulled out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she went on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who tried at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ wear the under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; the people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the surface standing , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the base , pulled off their own str@@ aps and pants , and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just got there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; all star@@ ing , when they returned the under@@ pants , which you obviously have not fallen , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other sub@@ h@@ oses , before it finally decided that her was nothing , moved , and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b her that she was watching someone - or about the person who would like to buy the pants that she had tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would like to take shelter with home , who had another person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale , after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had she had and returned and they were not washed out .
&quot; said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is a speaker from Pri@@ mark , &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our office in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attack
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him feel safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York , to find out how to circum@@ navigate with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; whether you &apos;re approaching yourself from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn off for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from the back then you should turn out to be the first , so you can see your att@@ acker and get off from the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
seize the gun then between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee in the bar and turn off , while the Att@@ acker sp@@ lash out against pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move backwards while she straigh@@ ten the weapon on it . &quot;
&quot; aggres@@ sors , which approach the front , is the technique similar - move your body from a step , grab the gun and turn it out , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the gun and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip , before moving backwards and keeping the weapon upon it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that it &apos;s at a counter at safest , your money is too rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide book to the dirty places of Europe
a bri@@ tish trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and lit@@ re @-@ le@@ x of a serious test - by going out some of the most fil@@ ly and ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ hing places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and Travel tor Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sli@@ pped his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ kno@@ b of a tractor toi@@ lette , as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the le@@ aps of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer for himself and to show us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the washing button of a train toi@@ lette blade , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with physicians and medical specialists about the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria , as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left , what he stretched out , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intestinal by travelling through the world , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to r@@ ins@@ cr@@ acks of res@@ tro@@ oms , the task laid down its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health affects and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and s@@ amm@@ ing water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely righteous .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its test @-@ line showed a magni@@ fier number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters of fresh @-@ driven hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to cut off after its L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products deliver the travel ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says : &quot; &quot; this comes the worst that I have rolled in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
&quot; I will not reveal nothing here , because it is here in@@ doors . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturers of dairy products .
&quot; the company sh@@ aded Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both military @-@ bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Sweet President for Snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to really offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with it , that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
affir@@ m that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead , instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our day @-@ to @-@ day environment , the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting manner .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian when he would have stuck my respect for Ian , as the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things , in which it was easier to bring Ian to put her and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ dation 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and bo@@ wel and 58 percent , they said that they at least use products , which contain an@@ x@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ usion with a damage in the amount of Â£ 50,000 because they wre@@ cked their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; having for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , the property co@@ oper@@ atives were found in an irre@@ par@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls have cl@@ en@@ ched holes , wooden feet have been en@@ cro@@ pped , garbage were disper@@ sed in the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were converted and it is thought that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing and said that they feared that the apartment is no longer fixed . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not to be so beautiful part Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is it likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had inf@@ licted the family , street fights with Bas@@ eb@@ u@@ sts , un@@ shy of residents , drug abuse , drug @-@ trading and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and escape . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
in some rooms of the house which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances the old trash was found
&quot; they were tra@@ ded in the estate , in which was acted in the past drugs , the wooden feet . &quot;
&quot; neighbours said that they had to fight them on the street , and regularly brought the police to the police . &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing Ho@@ war@@ del@@ etes them and their partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out .
Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ants were rejo@@ icing of ligh@@ tened neighbours that said their lives to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were talking about anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so calm - we are not usual !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that there was a family owned by the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called in regular intervals : 20 years &quot;
on the over@@ secured side of the centre of the town became trash and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it administered the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of her family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step , Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration . &quot;
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions had to be anno@@ yed for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who are courageous to us and have provided us the information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will con@@ sol@@ ation some neighbours and im@@ par@@ ted the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived in the house at different times , but they all were over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that resi@@ des in one of the bedrooms of the house according to the del@@ usion on the floor
workers of the house administration are now going to be garbage to garbage bags that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid on the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ nel and cash in height of Â£ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine line after having found itself guilty of the ownership of a drug class B in commerce .
they claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 at an automobile accident .
&quot; after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room@@ ing walls of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will r@@ enter r@@ enter , which will not stick to the place of the house . &quot;
&quot; Angela C@@ row was shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ cation was a clear warning to the other tenants which do not comply with the property order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , and those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate discrimination and anti@@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal is in panic after a ti@@ eff@@ er@@ ated military jet is transferred
&quot; sun lovers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal , the Scho@@ ck of her life &quot;
an portu@@ g@@ isi@@ c P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of air forces placed an incredible storm @-@ flight
&quot; the aer@@ ators said that it was on a training flight , but pers@@ isted that there was no security threat . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment , in which frigh@@ tening tourists start to panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ er@@ ous jet cras@@ hes through a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane crash on the sun@@ rises on the beach @-@ section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers ins@@ isted , when they began to worry about the noise of the bowls , without seeing what caused by the clouds to them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flies twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; Nun@@ o arrogan@@ ce added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that , when the plane crash down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro stayed in panic when the plane came out of the dark and flew deeply deeply
&quot; the Portuguese aer@@ ators said today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft was on an exercise flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , and so deep that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the Jet because of the poor visibility of visibility is somewhat deeper than usual , but ins@@ isted the air forces that the security was at no time je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese Festival , where four people on the island Madeira came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese aer@@ ators said today that the pilot had to fly , due to the conditions - strong fog and br@@ anding - which had to fly so deeply , which restric@@ ts its view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot fisher@@ man had to identify as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worried about Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first introduction in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans appear in the du@@ el to the Spanish Super@@ cup backwards against the FC Seville ; the relap@@ se is rising three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the dou@@ ble@@ w needs to disp@@ ense with the basement of C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europa @-@ League champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar who gar@@ den@@ ies the Olympic Winter tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andre ter Ste@@ gen .
&quot; the German suffered a b@@ anding in the knee , with what the demand for Bar@@ ca is clear at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen , which has been the status as the number one in Barcelona for two years now . &quot;
&quot; Coach Luis Enri@@ que was a clear decision for this so far , and did Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen in most of the other cont@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is a doubt about the fitness state of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at the 3 : 2 in the proxy for S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
Seville in turn has the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against real Madrid and seeks the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this review . &quot;
Ma Long in an own League to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis courts .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale to his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; front defen@@ ders &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.2 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; with this , the World Championship @-@ First Award won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and of Olympia . &quot;
brass went to the Japanese Jun@@ Mi@@ er@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title among each other .
&quot; thus , it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick up a Chinese title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympia Trepp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ã @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ eing @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the plate alone , between the sets and in time outs they had no Co@@ aches in itself . &quot;
they had withdrawn on the grand@@ stand and left their tren@@ ches at a fair competition alone .
&quot; the mat , until here I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finals , I play for me , &quot; &quot; had said a slope . &quot;
after the group posed gold and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China Flag .
the Match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
Ma had really had to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he set the pace in the plate and left the slope there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the superiority of Ma , it did not develop the expected te@@ aring match . &quot;
but nevertheless there were enough breath @-@ changes to be seen .
Mi@@ er@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; the White @-@ Taurus was held in its quarter @-@ finals against the German European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , according to medical treatment , had to be &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; with brass . &quot;
the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and JÃ¶r@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way very high table tennis Olympics .
Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ t â³ da@@ unting problems â³ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states , to include their majority . &quot;
President @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump now had weaknesses of his election campaign in the hitherto Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the normally large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , there is now doubt about his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump into evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , there were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can High Se@@ eing sha@@ kes
Utah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ can .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by the Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his bankruptcy by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; other institutes do not see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
also as endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question as he wants to stop the advance of Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and pi@@ cks back : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does not make any other than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end of the political correctness , whether this is in order , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the Press report , the Party of Tr@@ ump should have threatened , funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
instead of how it wants to take the candidates of Re@@ public@@ ans to Congress more strongly among the arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ ister fraud on D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipline @-@ commission in the event .
K@@ eni@@ as Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten threatens the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a bed @-@ on trial at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ary Commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary has communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village had a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this is the team leader Kenya had been reported by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case to use their own investigations , distributed a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing station and has worked as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , issued the sample and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
&quot; he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training control of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich took over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of Heads of Deleg@@ ation@@ ist Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he shall have informed about cash payments of his country over the upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reporting , he should be arrested in Nairobi at his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya faces the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing processors already for a longer time under particular observation .
&quot; in the announcement of the IO@@ C presented by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 D@@ oping purposes set before the Rio Olympics , it has been previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into . &quot;
&quot; the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted pressure on the African country in front of the summer , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks prior to Olympia @-@ beginning .
&quot; as a result , W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing @-@ fight con@@ forms with the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a large runner @-@ nation .
the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten of the country won the most medals at the World Cup in Beijing at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
&quot; in a series of television reporting of the ARD , the ARD reports were raised again and again , that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of the athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he had hired them in the Russian body . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type brick and systematically lab@@ elled . &quot;
Russia Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten were then excluded from the summer play .
Salzburg &apos;s West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ ney Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece &quot;
&quot; the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of Classi@@ cal , and filled with the role of Mary a youth space . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra , Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this staging the Bart@@ oli plays an older Lady .
she is reminded of melanchol@@ y on her beloved with Tony as the younger Mary is playing and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also naive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a redness , lau@@ ghing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an extremely generous man .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for it , it is a necessity for him . &quot;
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have walked the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ kh@@ ans had gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same issues , and they are just as expres@@ sive as it was then . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London school Girl , who joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said , that her family was driving a few weeks ago by her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the B@@ oll@@ ard of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died shortly after her family shortly after she had imagined the war@@ like country and return to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it , to go into a war area - to prevent people ever to make this decision , &quot; A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA climbed up and two other school girls from east of London in a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been informed that she married a ISIS comb@@ at@@ ants in Syria , and within a few months a widow . &quot;
Rei@@ d says she will be in case of a election at Gar@@ land as a candidate for the Supreme Court .
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the President of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton concluded the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans at the Senate have blocked from Barack Obama in March since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
&quot; the majority of majority in Sen@@ at Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge on the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia . &quot;
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose Gar@@ land with a certain level of assurance .
&quot; talking about Rei@@ d said , later that he had not spoken to Clinton , whether she was nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ &apos;s team would not worry for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the first judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Re@@ public@@ ans the Gar@@ ry nom@@ ination block , be l@@ ai@@ en and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can Presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he also stated , Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants nu@@ ances for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works together with the photographer David Belle@@ mere to get a 1970s inspir@@ ational calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ sy for 2017 . &quot;
the Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck @-@ magazine from classic school @-@ Play@@ boys says that &quot; Play@@ boy for men is .
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that there is the calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to release the cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .
Mod@@ els can submit their images online or in person at open Cast@@ ing Call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : a Kurdish community counts with mass cur@@ sed
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan , sitting on packed bags , &quot; says the name of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting ten thousand of thousands of people who flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , there could be even &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; , &quot; believes the association &apos;s leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the harsh suburbs of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan on the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass cur@@ sed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the association &apos;s leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already been over@@ bur@@ dened with Stra@@ i@@ tions in months ago , they are 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the temp@@ ted coup were still secular and opposed ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , who takes on the refugees , produced refugees in their own land , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the head of the exile , the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
so that Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the exclusion of remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ pen@@ k , who is also CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; he said that the German government positioned itself as sharp , as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany I find a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ Movement also feared the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition opposition . &quot;
the Brand@@ ler@@ ites as freight tra@@ ilers destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever fails to fit and Erdo@@ gan , sitting on packed bags , incidentally also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported as an appeal to figures by the Federal Ministry of Ministry , the Turks presented the largest group of the asylum seekers of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the date of 30 June , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum @-@ approved ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) have been approved . &quot;
in this survey we do not find the fear of war , poverty or fu@@ tility pl@@ ess@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum justified according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual per@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals have nothing to choose from the summer @-@ election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern it is understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
for bl@@ ended as so far it is not going to be : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day struggles . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the champi@@ ons are on vacation .
&quot; most of the holiday makers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , RÃ¼gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so must not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems occur : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters infl@@ ated , fl@@ aps infl@@ atable , fl@@ yers and count on the end of voices only lab@@ eled lab@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the Elec@@ tro and last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave yet an election campaign close to the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ing , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U @-@ coalition , must fear its position . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now located in Sur@@ ve@@ ys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strongly new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ D cuts down and what remains at the end of cooking @-@ proof remains . &quot;
&quot; S@@ cel@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 , is an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from its large phases . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it was his legendary predecessor Harald E@@ yel@@ ash . &quot;
otherwise sea @-@ cold feet got and gives Merkel the blame on the flowering of the Af@@ D .
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We manage &quot; &quot; and acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably be the best office for him now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their peak data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you do at the wrong time at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large numbers ; Merkel Bundest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not agreed , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other LÃ¤nder , &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is a shame also to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U refra@@ ined largely to the usual voting units on market positions and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; so , co@@ vert , play only one &quot; sub@@ ordinate roll . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also , the Union has noticed that in the country you sh@@ ackl@@ ed the base that it has to be very strict , back one wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are about the left , the SPD , the Green : there is hardly any place in the countries of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U Elec@@ trot@@ ter to its collaborators , however , is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is standing on the game , S@@ elling has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last fired at 22 per cent of the CD@@ U partners ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
&quot; in 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Greens , small @-@ party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to create the leap into the agricultural day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holiday hard@@ ship and embarrass@@ ed their constitu@@ ent in the internet .
&quot; online @-@ election &quot; , &quot; it is called the State Le@@ aders of Claudia MÃ¼ller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral fighters on the search for indigenous stimul@@ ants come among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ moderni@@ zation : guest rooms suffer from block@@ age
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ printed , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end up at 8 o &apos;clock , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite ri@@ dd@@ ly , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no de@@ duction .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to transfer to the south as scheduled to the south end of October , until the end of October it should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ used will also be praised for the construction work responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to set up @-@ up trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to south is emigr@@ ated and also the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg consists of relaxed , the traffic situation within the village has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel by O@@ f@@ ter@@ nia from the B 27 again .
the traffic through the place seems to come back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; said the chief executive director of the rehabilitation responsible leader of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straÃe , port town and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many s@@ wir@@ es were seeking and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i familiar than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some truck in urban@@ ization areas .
&quot; as also the speed limit currencies have not been respected , the community called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ Ã¶s@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who himself made himself the location on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have been lit@@ tered .
the fastest was on the way with 77 hour kilometers at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the road is now again open . &quot;
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look at the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 @-@ Rehabilitation has led with them to sales @-@ bro@@ ods in them , lets each one ask you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less concerned . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; slight decline , &quot; but also a fact that naturally &quot; the drives is missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the e@@ at@@ eries along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the hosts made it hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was missing customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; in terms of sales revenue , it is based on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
the road @-@ ens@@ ation have left its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff have to dis@@ missed .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees , and half would have been dis@@ missed , the policy would have been differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President JÃ¶rg Schmidt , on a request by G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the reference reply , the guest care benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B . now , they also had the disadvantages , which result in the renovation . &quot;
G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such a kind of funding has been tra@@ ded .
&quot; in all cases , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been settled ever since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now subject to less often due to complicated traffic , it can be understood . &quot;
&quot; if one can not drive , it is also somewhere nice . &quot;
&quot; that his tribal climate after the end of the san@@ itation work again , there has no doubt on it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 @-@ works on its customer base for the biggest crisis which has experienced its place in her long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , that is already brutal . &quot;
constantly ro@@ wing in the name of the terrorist fight against laws .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re now provides a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a job status with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ an partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they are calling for no one .
&quot; others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also in this case I participate .
&quot; but as the Minister of Interior , he is well located in the results and in a &quot; &quot; for@@ dable consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
the Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re has moved a little time after recent attacks in WÃ¼r@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach to present his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some have already been announced , proclaimed , disgu@@ ised : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the bu@@ cking co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany has to apply several EU guidelines to air passenger data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re starts a second request for proposals related to the SPD : he wants to place sympath@@ iz@@ ations for terrorist groups under punishment and ch@@ atting jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spati@@ ally the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still consider this to be reasonable and demanding that in any case the co @-@ operation partner does not have any chance . &quot;
a few new ideas presents the Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re as well .
they are in part in themselves : he plans for de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are systematically fet@@ ched into the country should previously let their smartphone check in and disclose social media accounts for a safety examination .
he wants to put worse off for distr@@ acted asylum seekers or so far - about those who commit crimes or throw away their papers in order to conce@@ al their identity .
some of it is political and legal .
some also acts invisible and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of ideas for instance , the question arises : what does this have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be expressed in a speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and WÃ¼r@@ zburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people in the face of the high refugee numbers were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deeply engaged in people , they were not able to cling to now even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in its focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in WÃ¼r@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are campaigns . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the European Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking place for internal security . &quot;
in the last days between the two parties there was high .
&quot; only a gar@@ ment dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then over a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ orts has also called a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is also an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return of the double pass he is holding nothing .
we have free@@ zes the discussion in Germany .
&quot; re@@ making it new , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , it is necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could pose for argument .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ filed with the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized first time to talk and say , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
still Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ pf@@ d is still coming through .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running around .
&quot; on the back @-@ back campaign , there is a term for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the ex@@ change@@ ability he has in the second half of the year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s biggest car@@ makers can continue to increase , despite its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW was mainly in Western Europe , and poll@@ uted the overall sales , such as the company quoted in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW was sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ down the supplies to almost a sixth of them .
JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann continued its weaker figures from July first and foremost on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets it was given a changing economic framework &quot; a department store . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the exhau@@ st working first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the most affected house brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen already continues even further due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is only a supplier of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler could further forward a sales split from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , around the world around 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software package .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the re@@ armament , VW , that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ armament of the vehicles , there would be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ makers ask the customer after the conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason are legal subjects .
&quot; the &quot; focus &quot; had been reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for continuous diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
&quot; from the traffic Ministry , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my investigation Commission and the KBA market . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this will not be accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ or@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the retro@@ fitting no further deterior@@ ations occur and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; but not as it was in business travel .
&quot; the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; is Volkswagen to see that customers come to a workshop for instance half a year after the retro@@ fitting into a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage is nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that it is possible with any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal if it says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank director Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily accounts . &quot;
the German association German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal : normal spar@@ ers &quot; would not have to be feared to pay for their as@@ parag@@ us pen@@ ises .
&quot; bearings banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euro on g@@ astro@@ - or daily monetary accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will be 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for a while it has been 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not be able . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and causes 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the bank chief . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for each million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , the cost will give it further . &quot;
&quot; the cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four over the fifth , I do not like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank pre@@ disposition . &quot;
most of the customers could have understanding and changes on other investment forms .
only few hi@@ ked to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative union of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; they are alone to wear , be &quot; economically permanent , not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank account , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
&quot; with prosecution for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gia and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank geri@@ burger country had been headlines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 headlines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main managing director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide coverage for deposits , which is a lot too strong in Germany among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a banker spoke , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see I give &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped by the property a little lush . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they make money for free . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ founded cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ very , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; in currently , the cooperative union of Bavaria , &quot; currently no other banks are known to charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Federal Association of the German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ Ã¶h@@ lich , had stated at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives towards the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it im@@ poses the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not leave it in the width .
destination plates : who does not buy Sonic plates ?
lonely men middle aged men love plates .
&quot; before you become the comment of the comment , in order to cut it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non@@ Al@@ le@@ Ein@@ sam@@ pler &apos;s age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement leads from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lication of sound sheets does not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the new unity of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently purchased a record are all predictions according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : the older records are keeping their feelings more likely ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; when this blog was a news report on television , I would follow the camera , while in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o lead , a modest gray suit and wild while I ste@@ al , my hands and something determined , like &quot; &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slow on his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and soul . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I followed by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men aged ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , one woman , probably about the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; this sound records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not ask him home ) , dress up the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford , when they appeared and re @-@ buy objects , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70@@ ies who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , when I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who are buying records , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my l@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and can see themselves again to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually got rid of them in 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to get back their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores provides a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customer participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat back to the stability of confidential sound records , of objects , the happy j@@ ubil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions , as a kind of comfort , &quot; says NE@@ Z . &quot;
that is with me as collectors so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; com@@ fy a staff of a record pile . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M revealed in April that almost 50 % of the people , who bought a record last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while I blo@@ cker with a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; I do not have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it &apos;s definitely happening .
&quot; more productive , less musician . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who are slowly coming slowly . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , which has dedicated the gram@@ ophone almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos make teen@@ ager and women middle aged . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts new synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ be@@ grab@@ bing pop instead of experimental jazz blend out of the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them sees son@@ o@@ dly , but na@@ ve mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach if one stands next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around a few minutes in business and considers the variation of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a shop her@@ edi@@ tary than a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collection of plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired : urban Out@@ f@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; while I want to give the impression , the jeans @-@ hot@@ ly mix , I watched a group of young teenagers , who group himself for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter imagine a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it itself - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to use them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; label art . &quot;
&quot; considering that any attraction for these items can mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my studies have occurred that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record business and in online research . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the stroll through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while taking the rigi@@ dity of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ year false moder@@ ator , that overlooks the shoulders of nothing of the middle aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects an offer about demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live down . &quot;
&quot; in case of trial proceedings , the government argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ aries where people within the camp goods , sell , hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants sell . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture , argu@@ ing that these places should be dec@@ eased because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire@@ work risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups split the dish that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the stat@@ ely supported Association and other groups are not sufficient to provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 Pro@@ visional shops , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois Mol@@ de said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide calm meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by Nieder@@ re@@ issen was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s CafÃ© des Camp , where English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum valu@@ ables for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; CafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was meant that the closing &quot; &quot; for those children of a catastrophe would be , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
&quot; the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migr@@ ants said on Friday , that the number of living camps had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new arrivals over the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia @-@ disappointment : Martin remains pu@@ gn@@ ant
&quot; despite his disappointing appearances in the Olympic Time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin will not want to be entertained . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er needs to adjust to the next generation of speed measuring : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ Ã¼n@@ der to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for instance , can be used at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement of the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway building sites or to sandy bridges with temporary temp@@ pin , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
however a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , which is enco@@ ded via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be collected across several tracks at the same time . &quot;
variable speed limit as well as depar@@ ting from time to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with p@@ endant cl@@ utch . &quot;
&quot; with it he is not simply cl@@ oned off , it is se@@ ated in the instrument run , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and incidentally also sh@@ aded outside out@@ fit disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states have been tested and is now also employed . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technique : recently , France has found 100 pieces in a Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain takes silver at the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji master@@ class Gold fet@@ ches
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the finale on Thursday evening at a rup@@ ting stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten to Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in the handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , post@@ ings , line @-@ up and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the not too bad tro@@ phy of silver Med@@ al - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day might return to it in the final . &quot;
&quot; but independent of this , Fi@@ ji could have fought a 15 @-@ man team in the form of a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal in order to hang on his neck : fi@@ j@@ is chief coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former head for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost at Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
&quot; the work@@ book is we@@ ave , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and sent the GB@@ s from fun picking up .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co . , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winner went out 5 @-@ 0 up , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack on the right corner , which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly captured the ball .
a th@@ read@@ ra@@ ving T@@ tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal but it has stopped Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner is a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ ected and there was still over a minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed by further weak T@@ ackl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while UK still da@@ em@@ nt . &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant inter@@ play by Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for UK , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game has been running for long before the South Caucasus , whose fans s@@ cat@@ ches , flags and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the fi@@ ery approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake cake with a further trial in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff ert@@ al , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and the GB ki@@ cked down in the lawn . &quot;
earlier at the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain urged South Africa in a scarce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought forward the bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored one gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant T@@ ackl@@ ing of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ine gold than in these games and that wants to hot .
&quot; from the first ro@@ wing to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which will go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; although there were only those who sat at the entrance , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as it was the second olymp@@ ag@@ old in two without tax lady in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their dominance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9,@@ ter un@@ settled use , which is likewise un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athle@@ te who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflecting the kind of triumph it is ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the ro@@ wing lies a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers to make the difference , and there was no one more inten@@ tional than the coach , who would not even survive this day when cancer was diagnosed . &quot;
as he said he was risky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , it spreads throughout . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin with the interruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the ro@@ wing at itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ min@@ ence of victory , their first thoughts passed to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ up morning with a little more than usual , and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were not able to keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters when the teams began to stop from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , abi@@ ding in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get involved .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking forward to doing something Great . &quot;
&quot; today we did not want any fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race that we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver will have to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
it was all that new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ s &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ Ã¶l@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small predat@@ ory drinking water @-@ purpose as a model for the great water manufacturers .
so ago it was for some time in the origin@@ ator at a contribution by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the Aqu@@ forum of the government of sub @-@ Fran@@ ks had the purpose @-@ association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ s @-@ group &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far &quot; &quot; was exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶l@@ ler , who was 31 years in the purpose @-@ association staff , of which 28 years as managing director . &quot;
at the age of 65 he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ s @-@ group with its head office in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of latitude , promotes more than 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and past@@ ure with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; members are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Broad@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current chair , latitude , mayor , Ger@@ tru@@ d BÃ¼h@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶l@@ ler was appointed as a water @-@ wart and appointed 1988 to the managing director of the expe@@ ditions . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from the water management and maintenance work via office and organisational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency ports on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , and compensation for farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the divi@@ ding of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stal@@ em@@ ate , and I have always added new additions , because water life flow , and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised the Go@@ ddess faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he was employed with a lot of heart blu@@ ff@@ les for its water@@ purpose and he lived in the water@@ way association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to present nit@@ rates in front of the water forum of the District . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received a great deal of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶l@@ ler s@@ on on the one hand , Al@@ f@@ ons Al@@ f@@ ons Sem@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water@@ way and he was a loyal ball .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as high points from his point of view he recorded the fountain building and the re @-@ structured of the expe@@ dient .
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , was the pi@@ ping at the High Pri@@ ests at Kirch@@ berg and on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; again , the supply of Neu@@ brunn was only maintained because one filled the container of P@@ ett@@ stadt and filled with h@@ oses . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel storms that advocates the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶l@@ ler .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ood - man sho@@ ots at risk
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man on Friday was shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ood ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ood . it is fatal .
&quot; the man himself was with us and stated to have shot his partner &apos;s partner , &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ishing speaker . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him I become publicly noted . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown , brown and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him . &quot;
it is however a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a g@@ ossi@@ p .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself such as the police .
&quot; who sees Sven S. , is supposed to call 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in LÃ¼@@ beck , the relevant police in LÃ¼@@ beck didn &apos;t want to make any statements about the Ta@@ ther@@ ance or the relation between perpetrators and victims ; however , they confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing . &quot;
&quot; we are not saying that currently , &quot; &quot; said a Poli@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher@@ in in LÃ¼@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; ye@@ witnesses , report@@ edly , was a special force ( SE@@ K ) in the scene . &quot;
steel - light view for the German steel industry
the cr@@ acks @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains caused by additional costs in meg@@ acities .
financial stresses that threaten the industry from the oil production process are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the liberation from the Renewable Energy @-@ Shift in its components to so @-@ called self @-@ energy production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Y , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad we were able to finally reach negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission had therefore initially planned to use the steel producer , the gases from ho@@ sto@@ ves to generate electricity for their own consumption , to the checkout process . &quot;
&quot; according to the steel industry , the steel industry is additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Y , I now give a foundation certificate with the European Commission to talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators used in the steel drives , an EEG of 20 percent will be replaced . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for their own power .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be written . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even when re@@ forming the emission standards , climate and employment targets are considered , &quot; &quot; IG Metall leader JÃ¶rg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from capacity and a significant price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer in China given the weak@@ ening of domestic demand for massive steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers reject Chinese steel @-@ con@@ nen @-@ dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
&quot; on the one hand , import duties on be@@ port@@ st@@ ole effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have revol@@ ved . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained cautious on Thursday .
finally the prices could be st@@ agn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted not to exclude the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturers remain careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3,4 million tons they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Community Steel Community was on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to another month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production of two percent is below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
the association counts in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does seniors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already their entire life : as young girl she was in school choir , at the mag@@ ister@@ ium study , she occupied the fet@@ ched music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehearsal , it feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; while doing so , she does something good in doing her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; for singing is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German people of senior . &quot;
&quot; most of the seniors singing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the regular mer@@ it , the elderly are able to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because frequently , social and family structures emerge at age , an choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also done Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together .
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
for they exercise seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly demands his lungs regularly , is also not so fast in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft Mineral@@ wolle organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher place , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melodies , the dis@@ mis@@ sive human being dis@@ missed in long backward events . &quot;
&quot; at singing , the head is also required for a special performance , &quot; says L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; elderly people who live alone , practice themselves not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem also grows by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do long for something , I will be better and vig@@ il@@ ant beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he says , little talent to have , betra@@ ys l@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sings alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who even sounds when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , seniors have different opportunities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a housing , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities are also offering views of choirs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ astic choir , can turn directly to the church or the Church . &quot;
many people of seniors can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the help of the internet . &quot;
&quot; who would like to sing , should not join a choir , betra@@ ys H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensitive to kittens to cri@@ es of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover which effect the pen@@ alties of fel@@ ines on adult animals have .
&quot; to her surprise , the Mi@@ dian also did not let the males go cold - however , they always kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the level of fel@@ ines at the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
they are responding to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of kittens who have found himself in great need as scientists have found out from the veterinary University and the Medical School of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) .
&quot; han@@ go@@ ver may also react on the rod of kittens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; clearly , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ cks of less and strongly stir@@ red p@@ ups for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the kittens cry with the urgency of their help is distinguished . &quot;
&quot; observed in a total of nine adult han@@ go@@ wns and eight females , from the animal management of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they were played for a rod of babies which were taken from the throw @-@ box for three minutes and were separated from both mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens who have additionally been lifted up . &quot;
the researchers consider their results despite the low sample for expres@@ sive .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker to play when this Ru@@ ff has played a very intimate kit@@ ten .
this ability may possibly be alleged or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in baby @-@ noise . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey there is a arrest warran@@ t against the one @-@ time football star Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ kis@@ r .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey will once again take place an important football match . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ el of the Or@@ riv@@ als between Mon@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; already in the suspension of an emergency relief after the overthrow of the revolution in July , the government , the everyday life of volunteers , should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this , however , does not apply to those who are suspected of the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
this is not being done before the football match .
against the former St@@ ark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ ver introduced a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to this , the South of a terrorist group is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; SÃ¼@@ kis@@ r should be tra@@ ilers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , who is responsible for the coup President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although initially for 90 days of emergency , it is still valid until October , in fact this has no effect on the lives of most Turks but not as good as any effects . &quot;
the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places in the whole country Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for termin@@ ated .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what unites the Turks but in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats at Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Col@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; , &quot; it is especially reflected on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
his sporting value was proof of the KÃ¶l@@ ner in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first season as a Top@@ scor@@ er of his organisation .
in end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he recorded the 1 : 0 winner .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured a tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , &quot; the disappointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the previous round @-@ kno@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; also appeared in the European League early . &quot;
in the South by Li@@ g it was only rank six .
the season was not good .
tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we did this and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master visits the year was better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 season figures , as well as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ er kÃ¶@@ nig , the base for the 14th title was put . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in the course of AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez came under the contract and had only borrowed Gom@@ ez after the Putin &apos;s attempt to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario now wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; director Fi@@ or@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; for this , the falls would have to be ready to ab@@ stain at around a third of his to 7.5 million euros much more estimated , Or@@ man realized : &quot; his salary in Florence , we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals for Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others sur@@ led Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinners so can only laugh - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic D@@ oping determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained its start after a dop@@ ing lock , was put forward in their launch ( 100 meter chest ) and bu@@ gged out . &quot;
&quot; it was a sk@@ in@@ rile scenario : with a laid smile she was still proud in the hall , and had prov@@ oked with her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as fixed , that she will not get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ubil@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , which go to the start despite dop@@ ing past in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
it was already locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympi@@ ans of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ans and si@@ eben@@ fold World Championship in 2010 had to be a six month lock in 2010 after taking the intake of the pain against Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had had strong pain , defended themselves at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympi@@ ans of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europe was positively tested on the ban of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic bes@@ po@@ ke the kno@@ b intake and was locked six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ ce .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ge ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 positively and 21 months were imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ge . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest growing man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athle@@ te have been detrimental to as many medals there . &quot;
&quot; so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after it was established with him testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympics @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone @-@ abuse .
&quot; this was also recognized by the bronze medals of the Olympic Games in 2008 , due to a part of the International Tribunal of the International Criminal Tribunal . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is in rank two of the world championship .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the World Championship and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but must still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old World Championship , references to taking a bot@@ any dietary supplement had been found , the lock of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada was mil@@ der and ran off on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ror in Thailand - Att@@ aches in breach - multiple deaths
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for foreign affairs , Thomas Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ . &quot;
&quot; she had f@@ aded and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this . &quot;
she planned her home trip for early September .
&quot; whether by the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ ch also Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; the police were killed by a Thai and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian in three Germans , three Netherlands and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; early Friday , two explo@@ sives went high , and according to the authorities , a further human being was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong river was injured by police information a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb , which k@@ ills an urban pine@@ apple . &quot;
the spr@@ inkl@@ er had passed the air according to the authorities in a flower carriage before the prec@@ inct of the coast @-@ police into the air .
&quot; after all , we also called for det@@ ectors in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ one on the southeast coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; one go out from a link with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attack carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai criteria meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ an@@ early before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably , however , it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bomb , Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the attacks in relation to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one go out that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities have been mis@@ informed about the im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed of the exact date and the places . &quot;
still unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed their officials to the entire country to strengthen security around important governmental buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always minor bomb attacks , but they are usually not directed against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; following the nun@@ ci@@ ble bombs explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department recommends on his website , the instructions of Thai security authorities to make a result . &quot;
&quot; high security threat ( security level 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ enn@@ as and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were issued a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military influence even in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bombs were a try to seize chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the Military Un@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces holds himself good , the kingdom has led to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not been able to get a grip in the far south of the country for years in the far south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok it had been killed in an attack by a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ even@@ 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office of constitutional protection .
&quot; after several offices , the constitutional ar@@ cher in the federal government also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity movement &apos; approach for aspirations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said constitu@@ tion@@ ality Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press @-@ Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigration of other Islamic faith or the Middle East are being diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that &apos;s why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn ; &quot; an un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by es@@ tran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; Identi@@ ty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally try extremis@@ ts to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the people of Islam@@ ists just like right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
that is not good advertising for their own cause .
propaganda is said to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are very suscep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , several federal states had given reports of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have a knowledge . &quot;
&quot; however , for the constitutional protection , the possible contact of this kind may only be relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , which are extrem@@ ist , their target device is changing and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; it is , therefore , whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers , and refugees said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be extreme frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
&quot; it may be quite possible that further justi@@ fiable group@@ ings or small groups constitute the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee @-@ sh@@ ei@@ vers or attacks from other far @-@ right motives . &quot;
a clear or pan @-@ wide control of legality is not recognizable .
the previous groups were on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ined also expressed that many attacks on the account of men went to appearance before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the anti @-@ susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seekers have not been known to be criminal , politically motivated or p@@ endant of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many individuals have committed criminal off@@ ences that had previously chosen with right wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected to the example of CD@@ U , SPD or left wing , who then have radic@@ alised by far @-@ right m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros H@@ te becomes an Inter@@ medi@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ ans or world records the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia was so slow that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks it was then applied to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old was completed with a return of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather its not a sporty figure that attracted international media attention .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old will take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians received a special start from the international swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in more popular countries known .
&quot; as in ae@@ dic@@ s run most sports@@ men , I just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros H@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first pointed names were the lap .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ diction to a &quot; &quot; well @-@ wearing &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time he struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres from Fre@@ isti@@ l , playing no part . &quot;
comparisons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney pays the course of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
&quot; the appearance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone . &quot;
f@@ rene@@ tically was caught M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; if the election of the US president has nothing to become , Donald Tr@@ ump has already had an alternative video . &quot;
he then drive into the holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be a relatively short , long holiday , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Re@@ public@@ ans to the Re@@ public@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television of the CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end of political correctness , either that is in order , said tr@@ ump . &quot;

post increases in trade with electro @-@ transport
an electro @-@ transport vehicle of the German post office in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously big .
the Post is planning to sell their electric vehicle sco@@ oters as well .
&quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to offer its electrical transportation from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been examining its own developed sco@@ oter for months since months , with the letters and p@@ liers being sold to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ Executive Board of JÃ¼rgen Ger@@ des had said it always give inquiries , about by hand @-@ hand craftsmen . &quot;

&quot; in the post@@ own factory , the company is planning to build up to 10,000 cars a year and tier . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and share a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very sturdy step towards 2020 , &quot; he had said in the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we can place the entire fleet .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership is going to dis@@ appoint transaction figures
the Consumer Science Laboratory Gf@@ K exchanged his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the return arrived suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K research company Gf@@ K had imagined that the chair by Managing Director Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the results promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ continued business figures and the withdrawal of corporate governance is the world number five in the industry in front of a personnel start .
G@@ FR@@ P leader wants to leave the company for the end of the year .
&quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Arno , has already been made from the supervisory body already with effect on September 12 . &quot;
&quot; on the first September , leadership in the Board of Directors took over the previous board member of Gerhard Haus@@ rested , distributed the company . &quot;
&quot; he will officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; board driver &quot; &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
as the reason for the recall the company called &quot; different views &quot; on long @-@ term business orientation .
details would not want to call a company speaker on Friday .
&quot; in future , whoever will be le@@ ased to market research in future is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ ode it was meant to be on Friday , in the shareholders , the disappointment about the continued success of the years was derived from restructuring . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring are however still not seen after 5 years &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; given the last poor Gf@@ K business , each shareholder will eventually become in@@ calm . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , this would also be the qu@@ and@@ ts so it was . &quot;
the company had not been able to stop its losses in the preceding quarter of 2016 in the second quarter of 2016 .

accidents - Bus non @-@ slip in Karp@@ ac@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight ship@@ ments
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 Sen@@ iors I have been injured on Thursday in Krumlov ( Land@@ circle Aur@@ me ) , eight people have been injured . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , sharing the police with them . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach &apos;s bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to indicate their information according to a counter@@ grid , which was partly on the road train . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ person in the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire@@ fighter liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency job came to the accident on the inland road 2 .
the un@@ finished travelers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Krumlov district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
&quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot;
the investig@@ ators requested the lor@@ ence and possible witnesses to report with the police .
&quot; the fees per cow @-@ meter range from October 1st 2016 , for the range of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Booking 3,@@ 44 instead of previously 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 26 Euro ) , and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( up to date 2.2 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ e@@ water fee will once again increase once again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a low @-@ day calculation , the se@@ wage price is in Az@@ endorf then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ hÃ¤user ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found during the approval of the budget through the Institute &apos;s cult , that for these wast@@ e@@ water installations . &quot;
the cas@@ endorf market is required due to a legal basis for the investments to operate .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ d@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to take deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ator increased between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt was introduced to the panel , a new calculation of fees for wast@@ e@@ water systems was necessary . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the previous year period .
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ dious cervi@@ x formed Schmidt thus , that it is with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ e@@ water he@@ ater that lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 Ku@@ bi@@ k@@ meter per year . &quot;
&quot; based on the small distribution of distribution , for example , the expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would affect . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the wast@@ e@@ water in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the backward period of calcul@@ ating time in all three systems not least because of its age san@@ itation and repair expendi@@ tures have to be raised in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ d@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt referred to that in the wast@@ e@@ water Az@@ endorf , the mechanical aer@@ ation system had to be replaced due to a damage . &quot;
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ d@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and used for almost 20 years in operation of the first Kl@@ Ã¤r@@ tei@@ ch , which provides for almost 20 years of operation the first Kl@@ Ã¤r@@ tei@@ ch , which provides an additional aer@@ ation option to keep the water @-@ legal requirements also in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced supervis@@ ors and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the years of the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still considerably below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that at the low wast@@ e@@ water supply in the three systems the expenses for the operation and maintenance .
&quot; additionally , added Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment for wast@@ e@@ water costs over the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious in the duration of stone houses , especially since we could not extend the supply chain of the se@@ wage system Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these installations , because it is a deficit of deficits . &quot;
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation was spent in Bulgaria in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.@@ 2 % were fully booked .
the annual average flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) was measured in comparison with the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) amoun@@ ted to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.1 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1,8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco , apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; is the effect as Asian caricature .
&quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is uns@@ ensi@@ tive against races . &quot;
&quot; using his filter tool , it enables sn@@ ap@@ ing around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure born from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are in@@ flo@@ cked , stub@@ born tools , which produce more than 30 million improved selections per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps come to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ l@@ chat filters have drawn up criticism in the past in which they were accused of making the app Black@@ face or@@ derer or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week proposed a filter to some users , which gave them mud , false teeth and imposed che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caricature of A@@ sians - &quot; yellow . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy was raised to a larger problem that the company has diversity with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely used on Wednesday , with reports of The ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat rus@@ hed that it would have the feature disabled . &quot;
the company provided an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as a caricature of A@@ sians .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders that experienced se@@ sm , the filter reminded of hur@@ ting stere@@ otypes . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art co@@ ed , whose t@@ we@@ et was widely used across the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and eased unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not in@@ secure , but that the yel@@ lowing was drawn into the extreme . &quot;
sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company crossing this cultural pride .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration struggle , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices we hold all in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vul@@ ged into things as their older antagon@@ isms - could more of them go to sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture created that for a user is insul@@ ting , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u , Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a set @-@ set for medium and in a telephone interview , she said they believe that r@@ enter @-@ related control has a lack of diversity among the penetration practices at Sn@@ ap@@ l@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the large part white , only male driving leadership and ended its recording with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese I @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on diversity of its employees and points out its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it burned sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to an speaker , the company recently focused a personnel responsible which focuses on under@@ presented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said , in turn , she said her sn@@ ap@@ l@@ chat account is closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership of ISIS &apos; intelligence information , represents the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military occupation of the United States Central Command changed thoughtful information to character@@ ize an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states were allowed on site , an investigation committee of the Congress held in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the force comm@@ a , secrecy and of the Wehr@@ macht Committee , reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies , who reported how pre@@ determined their estimates regarding American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news related information , which were typically ingeni@@ ous by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ uren , were regularly identified a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism , as the actual state of affairs allowed on the site and have been consistently positively as analyses by other news services , &quot; &quot; read a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can become a member of the representative office . &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed consistency issues in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that government tips given below Obama instructions , the reports to change , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their officers , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of the year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s could already commence in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command changed the following reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in life , after being played , analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed knowledge while investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense Department . &quot;
democratic members of the news journalists issued on Thursday published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of tr@@ end@@ ent assessments of Isi@@ l and Iraqi safety services , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , announced in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the release of refer@@ ential reports , &quot; &quot; s@@ worn the morality of analysts and &quot; gave over a little room for dis@@ continued opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ ps and the Democrats gave no references to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts found in a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported from investigations by the General inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were taken after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press release of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense had no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the General inspec@@ tor were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ting opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Defense Department would welcome a controversial discussion on these important topics of national defense . &quot;
&quot; the investigation has led to the question of a successful aerial campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises regions . &quot;
&quot; criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , expressing a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker has also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker had confirmed that contrary to government agencies against the refin@@ ing state of the terrorist group , no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group would have taken no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this tent@@ ative refinement had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this realisation was not published however , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislative acts due to his conc@@ ise positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ re in April and was replaced by the Central Command at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women ; a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
&quot; one day after having shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two doors for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American people with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; this is what she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equ@@ alled in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two will achieve the first and second place within their group . &quot;
&quot; the first @-@ placed will take a little longer out of the path , which will cause the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may go on Saturday , the American players have triggered a surprising tor@@ ment through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 seats on the last of 12 seats . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sle@@ ger in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the nation &apos;s team , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; the Olympi@@ ad missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as it did not qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team all went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , and thus the things began to turn towards better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental shift and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work in London , which we now have . &quot;
we have been able to finish the Ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a back@@ cut out of the area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and holding the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and invited the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a course .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel continually and in@@ es@@ capable of , a rapid run between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is like the olymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself is a burning st@@ ab , which is passed by the bracel@@ et for s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you cannot turn the television to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in Coff@@ ee@@ shop , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ aders and C@@ had le C@@ los to hear . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who , for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female &apos;s warm with Gr@@ Ã¼b@@ chen , could certainly have been sent under this known name that would be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ known TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fairy . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not appear any event equal .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized : air p@@ adding , ar@@ chery , b@@ admin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I can modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
&quot; although the trampoline already has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so spar@@ se that many people I ask , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ant . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline , and had had an athle@@ te until the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider tip , partly because it sounds suitable for an enligh@@ tened ear for a clo@@ wn school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a educated enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of its never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving , the two sports which it is essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as spring@@ board . &quot;
&quot; upcoming winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , lifting and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ac@@ eg@@ ram , they are evaluated according to the execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight forward .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ists must continue in their pursuit of gold , faster , upward and out , sometimes to the goal , sometimes back and back , down and down in the playground . &quot;
&quot; they chase not only the ornam@@ ell@@ or , but also the output wall , but also in the television transfer : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented desire is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir the audience with tears . &quot;
but it is also what I even consider when looking out of these games as something fati@@ gu@@ ed .
one of these offers the trampoline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a moving forward is not the goal .
&quot; he or she sp@@ all@@ t , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like a a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then gradually below , then effortlessly back to the top . &quot;
&quot; here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time : the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the ends as part of a After@@ noon on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
&quot; if the degree of consciousness can only be achieved by the o@@ ids and the lenses of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air rin@@ ist , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators and the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters during the clas@@ hes with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last few months protests against the government broke out the country and spread more and more areas .
last week thousands of people hit the streets and slo@@ wed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses passed on that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot on very un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in the area @-@ being videos about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will be even harder , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is known to Nigeria the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the respectable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations , continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , where dissi@@ dents were effectively brought into silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiop@@ ies . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from the ground use until the stran@@ gle@@ hold related to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far diver@@ gent election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue to rise along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for this pron@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ den , which have been more or less imposed in recent years , take advantage of turmoil and be ar@@ ming again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of prior to qui@@ kÃ¶@@ chel@@ ns are now explo@@ ded under the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smart phones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media since cheap smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially at protests , so many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave us that they were gathered together to Prot@@ ect .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ ed the Am@@ har@@ as who come from Ethiopia and mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economics , while they are exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ hara and Mor@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the secret services , in trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was to his death on a not publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly wasted in keeping early signs of dis@@ content and use special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; other than Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region Nord@@ Ã¤@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes out of the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , that Ethiopia was experienced in such turmoil in 2005 , after thousands against elections were seemingly fu@@ eled by the government and were then stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months , and this time of unrest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts in Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal failure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ ested in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ous city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hate towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the U.S. protests and other Western allies hit a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used to be Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ age flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it was recently concluded that she concluded that base . &quot;
&quot; while the West will clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally collap@@ ses into a volati@@ le neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin crest . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama did ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to dissi@@ p@@ ate the final controversy on Friday that his campaign surrounds him , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would not have been meant seriously the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State . &quot;
this clari@@ fying clearly cast new questions regarding the communication capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans if it was able to communicate clearly and to communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fellow @-@ fighters who seek to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting , into the peculiar position of explaining his statements , which he would not have meant to be meant . &quot;
&quot; having done the reference for an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had returned regarding the claim on Thursday and ins@@ isted that he really did not intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but at an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a row of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help to weak@@ en the statement somewhat weak@@ ened it , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , wanted to know nothing of the Republi@@ can Presidential candidates . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of the critic broke down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump was trying to return to this subject again .
&quot; talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Elisabeth &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he would have found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism , when he said , the Russians ought to h@@ ack Mrs. Elisabeth &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; &quot; naturally I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts , which observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to hold his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted another note , since its circum@@ ference are further backward . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a big advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expressions , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow @-@ ites into the in@@ convenient situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent thin@@ kers , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said therefore to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back and so it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstream Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , it ISIS permitted to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively to control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words , and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he under@@ tak@@ ings the &quot; poor , &quot; po@@ unding &quot; &quot; television experts who tried to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can not ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats spot@@ ted over Mr. Tr@@ m@@ ap@@ ology as a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once at the price of the market , there is a cafÃ© in Green@@ point back &quot;
&quot; ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ nu@@ ance cafÃ© in Williamsburg , in which you could pay only bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been displaced . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
native people saw it as the last loss in a classi@@ fier city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ly wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still don &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is a change , it is also a new one . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ eb@@ ated ver@@ b Cafe opened last November at Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time staff of the old cafÃ© , the owner and managing director of the new cafÃ© . &quot;
he started working in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; as a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
&quot; however Rodri@@ guez said , that he also wanted to experiment . &quot;
he led new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches are with bac@@ on and cheese and there are wardro@@ bes such as cap@@ ers and acid oni@@ ons .
there are natural re@@ ks .
&quot; the cafÃ© serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months of Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez he said that he had noticed a st@@ alled stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers have also been pushed by prizes in Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira , there was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee house , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and the culture in the club , which was liked to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea ordered that is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ time and loyal customer from the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and this inevitably was the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ ll about that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered , a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ fed coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we are still going to deal with it , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish people Green@@ points have also accepted the CafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the Finnish and Rodri@@ guez menu , and Rodri@@ guez said it will soon be able to put them out soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the site has other benefits as well .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill and sell coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© is expan@@ sive on a nearby building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular participant and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the cafÃ© closed .
&quot; opened as the new cafÃ© , Wh@@ itt said that the Bet@@ ter and the Order of a new coffee was felt like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell this , he said . &quot;
&quot; the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an ample meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt , took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt , had a f@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated ins@@ istence on Fifth Avenue like P@@ Ã¢@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ turtles . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato mas@@ hed and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with other people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ker .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which is published on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , un@@ disturbed snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ que District , which has been in business for the stock exchange in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ ak@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable @-@ mix . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter h@@ ackers ordered , this found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat low @-@ gem that extends the ingredient .
imagine as many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ e sm@@ ir@@ ked .
&quot; it has to have put itself in the stomach as a lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years ahead of the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women bo@@ iled for male field work , and it was served fresh baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; they were the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; shows the paths that the country turned out to be no longer the land of the land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; as stra@@ ined was the new Bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious food such as loaves and Kas@@ ser@@ t were to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ ous as &quot; wonderful way , eating remains re@@ reliable , &quot; mer@@ cury ci@@ ble , since cooks were able to hide among a creative sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ fish .
&quot; one flesh , which was for years the center of the American cuisine , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar bl@@ ends were tried out , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishment preced@@ ence had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book that also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular fee at the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , drives budgets - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by drawing up recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ fulness &quot; women and to transform the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ am@@ y sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response from the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ eating @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa State Room of his kitchen , spe@@ ar like the millions of people from the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ red food room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt perhaps had committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ure the stamp with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the an@@ glers of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House caused the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the busi@@ est prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food was rejected , as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave them better understood in writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away foods .
&quot; she had a real fear of wast@@ ing food , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded himself : &quot; &quot; she did really sick people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploitation .
&quot; after the plate were vac@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they went and Co@@ e a dessert that they had dressed in at home : the pl@@ ou@@ ling , the president Roo@@ sev@@ elt , at mid@@ day . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble recipes have a name to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no curved cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; every deaf bit contradic@@ ted a spo@@ on in the tough , brown plat@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it did not tasted bad . &quot;
Co@@ e won three times a desc@@ endant .
&quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few sha@@ king wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others the life .
now is the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself killed in a bom@@ bed attacks by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a Civil Code , which saved the lives according to Bild @-@ Zeitung so far . &quot;
&quot; 2@@ 900 volunteers have their own lives on the game , to pull people out of bom@@ bed homes and to help in the war area first aid . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went to the world . &quot;
it made the Syrians about the shining symbol@@ ism in the di@@ gest of the war .
&quot; but as heroes , he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am dying to save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar was falling victim to the victim , in a video he had talked about the last bomb attack in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have rejected four wheels above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we are now eradic@@ ating the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play &quot; , &quot; the image cited its last words before he died . &quot;
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest vor@@ am@@ mal is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in the winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Forschungs@@ schi@@ ffs .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms up with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ ha@@ ie was first received with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; from the Greenland side of the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k on the bottom of the North Atlantic along , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it reaches , speeds up the five meters long animal on s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; that of slo@@ wn@@ ess lifestyle , however , seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; anyway from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein , commented by the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means for vor@@ tex a world record . &quot;
&quot; admittedly , the evolutionary biological ologist has long been that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie will become st@@ ony . &quot;
only lacking the evidence .
&quot; Greenland are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface only in winter . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know very little . &quot;
&quot; due to her tim@@ es@@ pi@@ pent@@ ag@@ o ma@@ ges them , when they left six animals in front of the S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; loot make this sh@@ arks anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they chase sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea , and looking car@@ c@@ asses , that tor@@ tures from higher water layers at bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 against Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as cat@@ cher from the depth of North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , whereas the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the status of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ et is already born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , which the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had striking a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ eup .
&quot; therefore , their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempt greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 centimeters in length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ ver@@ core includes a reduced excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons @-@ weapon , which is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday during his investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their lin@@ ver@@ tically , that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 centimeters long Greenland an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters can even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females only then get rep@@ ay when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers have to assign the length to an old age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters , probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , GrÃ¶n@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously subject at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
&quot; this , too , is likely to be the record for vert@@ ebr@@ ates . &quot;
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme are especially living in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; again , the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck a 120 years old har@@ ass@@ head tasted , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there is also much more fl@@ amm@@ ing . &quot;
so they mature later - and al@@ oud slower .
&quot; in order to keep yourself warm in cold water , animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; for the volume is much faster than its surface , which supports the animal warmth . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than in a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous , and should concentrate on having as many offspring as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary biological . &quot;
a very big animal on the other hand should raise its resources more in a long life .
building in a double pack
&quot; with themes around the building , the municipal council has focused on the latest meeting . &quot;
&quot; by relief , the panel assumed the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently added dwell@@ ings can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ tics and resolutions issues have been clarified and the requests for measurement could be made , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; SchÃ¶n@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) are interested in interested parties , nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ der@@ at is convinced that the bits in the rural and quiet residential community would appeal to young families and many other seniors . &quot;
&quot; as it says , construction will be notified immediately in the Town Hall , on the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also take questions about the relocation of other commercial enterprises , associated with the creation of jobs , the municipal council , decided to amend / cancel the surface area in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of sub @-@ time commercial activity there is now expanded by two plots towards the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city of Main has thus been competing with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities offered from London reloc@@ ated jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder , Head of Excellence , financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money homes can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , the approval in the UK is so far enough for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot;
these are just a big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is counting on 10,000 new jobs at the Main Bin@@ s for five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone , as well as other important regulatory authorities such as European insurance coverage of E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) holds its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg worth a great fund business , cut down but also as Dublin in the infrastructure worse . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city is easily accessible to commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries . &quot;
the Seine are also rent for premium commercial properties by 50 percent higher than in the Main .
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;

a U.S.@@ -@@ minister@@ ters decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs that you came out of the Hep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton concluded on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which revealed a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and its husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated 1 Million for charitable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of Bill Clinton had an income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster in her book about her office in Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ics candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax expl@@ or@@ ations of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ pers gave thanks to Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a bank@@ rupt contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind wrong exc@@ uses and reg@@ isters with regard to his previous promises to publish its tax exemp@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to release their tax expl@@ or@@ ations , even though they are not obliged by law to do so . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and its lawyers have indicated as a reason for its denial of tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the release of the President of the Socialists and Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advisor , to CN@@ N that he would not permit Tr@@ ump to post anything before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;

Clinton had already j@@ umped on the issue and published a video on the internet in the high @-@ ranking Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump for release his tax return .
on Thursday she talked about the subject during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential did@@ actic has done in recent decades and to release his tax expl@@ or@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump during the 1990s did not pay any or very little taxes , and an economic journalist in the New York Times announced on Friday a series of tax attorney and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case . &quot;
Bundes@@ taxes have become a subject in an election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets which would make sure people who earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ ou@@ at here has its head , Tr@@ ump for a meeting to exchange their tax expl@@ or@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ets , he was also subjected to the IR@@ S as well as a tax examination of the IR@@ S and tr@@ ump I have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ &apos;s campaign has res@@ igned tax return until 2007 .

condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ds of fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as eleph@@ ants
&quot; natur@@ alist in Tanzania are using an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited in people - they throw condoms on them , which are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which was already intensi@@ fying the idea ago by being trained together with the US @-@ natural protection by being trained to use volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , a non @-@ violent method to protect their homes and harvest without having to hurt animals . &quot;
previously many spe@@ ar used to defend itself .
Friday is dedicated to the telephone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe in this con@@ gregations a change of their attitude , having much more confidence that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a communication . &quot;
the first two steps cover the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; when he is not scar@@ ed , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ bl@@ ended with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works sc@@ anned into a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ig@@ ni@@ tion was shot only . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom comes with a kno@@ b and spr@@ inkl@@ ing fine dust of Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der in the air . &quot;

Jewish chore@@ ograp@@ her Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israeli pre @-@ election since it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country side @-@ list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; according to an explanation , the director returned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; woke him &quot; , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel owner said that the measure was a &quot; clear decision of management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , extingu@@ ish in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the set of Lan@@ z@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ merchant , called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and shortened by this event .
this is really very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this took place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident took a fairly large resonance in the internet , where the people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some underestimated the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it could have been granted the so alleged &quot; &quot; Arabian Gu@@ ests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , it was in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel would not include into the quick@@ ening track , &quot; &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung was a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added now .
police uses Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ ested Brazilian students
students took place on Thursday at the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police as they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as and rubber bul@@ lets against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to kill the students , which resulted in the police rubber bl@@ iss@@ ors and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the govern@@ ors of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , slightly less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ .000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters were seen by Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ por@@ an walls .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the Chamber of Commerce between Moscow and Teheran in the annual report at 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions on Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian enterprises in stores in the country grew strongly , distributed the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further trade @-@ expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the turnover of commerce between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports grew in Iran at 9@@ 1.5 percent and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; trade in turn has been achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year was the Russian foreign representative of around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , in Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record will be broken irrit@@ ating tourists in Russia from the last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something , of which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot;

&quot; how much money was exploited , the police does not share with them . &quot;
&quot; the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters large , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the top of the RE@@ WE market from the top of the RE@@ WE market .
&quot; the perpetrators must be ex@@ iled after the collapse into the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Way , and have folded from the opposite of the parking @-@ car park with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;

in the quietly located Frei@@ berg Hard@@ tw@@ Ã¤l@@ dle was the liv@@ able group during the first week holiday week .
several all @-@ day trips all stood on the program .

the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in the hot days the group was filled up at the sea level in M@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; culinary children and supervis@@ ors were pampered with their self @-@ prepared body@@ suit like the Aci@@ d Sp@@ et@@ le , the pier , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ Ã¼b@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;

the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral unit E@@ gre@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages have been tackl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next rum@@ mage of all min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the past two years , the tops of the round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage targets has been tested and is finally decided for the B@@ ish@@ ops of Freiburg , where this year I chose the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opening of mercy on the Open MÃ¼nster , a special pilgri@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is made of the Bitt@@ a bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern . &quot;
&quot; the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train it was driven to the start @-@ point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a MÃ¼nster was his beloved wife and so the pilgrimage path from the MÃ¼nster was stopped . &quot;
&quot; during the morning and in the evening the individual meetings were surrounded by a short boost with different prayers , songs and writers . &quot;
&quot; but they also went on the way the Min@@ is to Feld@@ crosses , chap@@ els , or churches and again , in order to sing a song from stub@@ born pilgrims . &quot;
for the nights they were looking for the parish hom@@ est@@ me of the local par@@ ishes .
&quot; Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty , hearty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
further on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ ave to GÃ¼@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags on that one came to the stage after St. Peter , which was the hardest way , but at this time at sul@@ try heat had to be climbed around 500 metres and then again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common gri@@ lling on the swimming pool in the evening .
after the dawn day on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery of St. Peter we went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ appe to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy we met the Min@@ is at the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burger MÃ¼nster , and passed the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse he was than@@ ked God .

&quot; in the end , all participants agree that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hed to home , as Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening at the men &apos;s team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team def@@ ends the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the edge of the An@@ c@@ ot , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young sm@@ iled and made the legend that he rus@@ hed to win a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
England admitted a shocking victory over four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March by train @-@ world Championships in London despite the return entrance to just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as execution .
ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom she stayed when she saw the potential in the vill@@ i that has un@@ folded now .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - those four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner put in the Quali@@ fication rounds of a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the standard of the New Zealand , the New Zealand was victorious on the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; lying after his lap , just back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and sk@@ inn@@ y held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy of strategy has made a large part of the transformation , in which it drove in a higher gear to slow down and to make it mark@@ y and above all sc@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when it came to the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
&quot; in the En@@ dr@@ unde , we have set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the side of the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des announced that he was clearly visible on the railway after a weak start . &quot;
he moved this statement later and there was no objection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a phenomenal victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; said , &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we got so badly with so many world titles that it was amazing to get back at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a bul@@ ute of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese that came from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ists competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ ry Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll are qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which in 2012 won gold in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of competition , at the Wig@@ gins with certainty will be focused . &quot;
&quot; he had disputed yesterday with respon@@ dents in front of the qualification , as him smells , to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , continued and finished , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ pelago of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in the world day in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team leaves itself on its strong rail bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick a check in medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio drove down .
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , such as the res@@ ignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es , as well as retirement from sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite thereafter , as could the now legendary reputation , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the melting shop of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy survey
&quot; the future of the aluminum per@@ mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at the game , as the system operator will cancel the energy contract and thus increase all delivery contracts , such as the supplier energy provider . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the ruling by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years fixed in November is going out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed at a closing time .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting pot consumed around 10 percent of the entire electricity production Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led last year to a close to the an@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the melting pot of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation as regards the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which , the large aluminum sh@@ re@@ mel@@ ted , supplied with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will terminate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to run , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting making &quot; , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
AG@@ L still said that the contracts are called &quot; backup &quot; that will have to force in force from November 2016 onwards .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will be handed in 2017 .
&quot; the AG@@ L therefore assumes that contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;

AG@@ L shared with that it was the value of the contracts already written in its annual ab@@ out@@ us in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; ability to operate or make the power supply to the melting shop &quot; not com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a statement , why it has res@@ igned by the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analy@@ st in the beginning of the week , Head of Operations , Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land is about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;

more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ege and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ners clan , is the cover of the cov@@ eted September @-@ edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ pi@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on its Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers for crying , wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ an family ( with the exception of the problem cases ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as well as the presence of their sister &apos;s favourite song and that ends with a classic turn : you have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ is@@ che@@ ating action of almost every birthday sep@@ tic by a return ( Se@@ ac@@ r@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You knew that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to share their other girls somehow in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s great sister Kim she likes what is concerned about the Vo@@ gue cover , ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the journal &apos;s cover edition is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most selling edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is more similar to a photo band than a fashion @-@ magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the cop@@ zers ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the revelation of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expecting so long @-@ awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still le@@ ak@@ ed before the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , we have been clearly more &quot; celebrities , &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , the celebrities &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of its generation - at the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous persons or Reality stars or young people of today who know how to go a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes to Jen@@ ner &apos;s true ) .
they are truly talented women who are looking forward in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared in the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jen@@ ners &apos;s success does not like anyone . &quot;
&quot; with her Reality @-@ TV history , Jen@@ ners &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something tense . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the M@@ ist@@ pieces of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jen@@ ners on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the abnorm@@ ality they appear to go over at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ners is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of em@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
you sold out from her naked pictures by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she is in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
in 16@@ 0.000 people annually following 16@@ 0.000 people
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid centers are rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the industry has already taken over the effects of further intermediate cuts to already over@@ sized transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those that have no funds for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ers and similar support - with their request for free legal advice and legal advis@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already fully util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , the legal centers will be further 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the community centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council centres revealed that thousands of people will be rejected each year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ h@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without the repe@@ al of the German Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; que@@ ens sharing centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and humili@@ ating debt , families , which were released by separ@@ ations , workers , the un@@ just wise men . all these people have problems of a legal way and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds around 30 per cent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal judicial system , as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these medi@@ tations as soon as the people need the help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the regional government fulfilled their commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to view the needs of the community centers and their client communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; for the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
this is representative surveys of the opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government co @-@ government in the north could continue to govern almost further , this is not possible after the survey results in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good opportunities to continue to head the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD led by 3@@ 5.2 per cent to 24 per cent in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; according to pol@@ l , the party plans to come back just under the CD@@ U back to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is controversial from the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 per cent ( previously , 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 per cent for the first time in Land@@ tag . &quot;
the Greens have no slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) in the heav@@ y@@ day .
&quot; however , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be present at the Land@@ tag in each case 3 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD of the survey took place only at 23 percent ( election in 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
&quot; it still leaves the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return to miss the pirates in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite dark . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at first eight Meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of Meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , that would provide today for approximately two sel@@ fs with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
&quot; Nokia 9@@ ,000 communic@@ ator began just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers , lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they are somehow out of the Stone Age . &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the CeBIT in Hanover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , even if agon@@ izing . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ see and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was able to work similarly to a laptop . &quot;
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; very proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average sales price of an smartphones in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has been different . &quot;
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell @-@ spar@@ ed of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today providers dominate the market that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; at all times online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are alone 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
&quot; with some 400 billion euros , worldwide sales with the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros . &quot;
these are the well @-@ running shops of the countless App providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone has now been a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was first came in early 2007 , at that time , Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , all easy to use by Touch @-@ screen . &quot;
&quot; the triumph of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the night . &quot;
&quot; finally , it disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
in the section each German today looks for 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; we all need to learn to complete the smartphone , &quot; said just Jan@@ ina &apos;s sphere , in the Siemens Board of Directors . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered to be a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring innovation and prosperity in our local communities , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the greatest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London when we had a huge effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local people and companies close to He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we are alone already 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , jobs , jobs and youth unemployment in the airport near the airport . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement pi@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters had wrong 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to rec@@ ede , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not a single infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , Â£ 211 billion on wit@@ ch@@ able growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both in both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw that has implemented a Â£ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented drives in the world . &quot;
now they are ready to supply a third cat@@ walk which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we can direct this olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; on display @-@ blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who make money with online advertising money come out according to one of the software manufacturers try to deal with ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisers on his desktop , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger where it communic@@ ates that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that his dis@@ k@@ top@@ site would change the co@@ ding with respect to his advertisements in order to detect the indication of the recognition that part of the page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ v@@ ise the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ H@@ er struggle has been going on in progress since the invention of scor@@ eboard in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world @-@ largest business has left into battle for social media , is a strong clu@@ z as to how worrying signs for the industry have become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study , according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ is air and Adobe about 200 million people scor@@ n loose food ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , who access Facebook through their mobile devices , makes hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 per cent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display @-@ block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile advertising block does not block effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , distributed a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs does require a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears the investment of such a step as rewarding . &quot;
on Tuesday Facebook shared Facebook with that it would update its &quot; ad pre @-@ fer@@ ment tool to learn more control over it .
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Block would be worrying , because they would also block content on the page , which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users that does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; display block@@ bu@@ ts are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected self @-@ suicide on a Swiss highway
the sacrifice was the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to return after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday during an suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the streets and were met by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a welding at the age of 49 years , that was driven by several vehicles , including a vice @-@ car , was to kill itself . &quot;
it still died on the spot .
&quot; several riders have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , who calls these as well as every witness to the incident . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investig@@ ational procedure which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter , the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ ve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said the Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - a person in the dark on the motorway ran - was decided that motor@@ cyclists do not have to go out that a pedestrian on the middle of the night runs on the motorway as it was called in the newspaper .
&quot; last year was acqu@@ itted a poli@@ cem@@ an of the neg@@ lig@@ ator killing , after having killed a man and killed that in August 2014 one night on the A1 was near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had been drunk , and has been unconscious on the street unconscious , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the Court stated that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- which had responded to an emergency -- on an justified manner and , that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; &quot; exceptional and un@@ predictable situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges was supposed to report on the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ del : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was probably accessible to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once was created . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow re@@ turn@@ around of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and yet slowly revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to be more quickly ev@@ ap@@ plau@@ d . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation simulation the slow re@@ turn@@ around of Venus its day @-@ side of the Sun almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds that works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average @-@ temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
the model brought out a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was thought before planets .
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ zu@@ much heat and ultra @-@ violet light were exposed . &quot;
its oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned out from the ultra @-@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen declined only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers share the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of Avalon

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ Ã¶l@@ workers resume talks on putting strike out
&quot; the working struggles regarding the compensation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ Ã¶l@@ workers are exposed , while all the armed parties set off the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the wrap process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wages of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group reduced its ranks to its counter@@ sectors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the acquisition of the company follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the business gives the needed space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and plans to abandon plans for its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as its business activities as a result of his me@@ ac@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group is ration@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation based on the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the new data can help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in constellation rot@@ ate to different rates , as well as in what context are the rotation times with the planning process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that thanks to the comparisons of our results with other clusters , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster which arose from around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood . &quot;
you are now turning into the fastest .
to top @-@ rate rates the str@@ apping stars come from great amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , its rotation begins to slow down . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ pler measures the rotation of each of the star , by taking the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ ac@@ ter -- as sun@@ spots . &quot;
the newest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates points out that massive stars revol@@ ve more than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ tes turn as smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , more comfortable against it to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star &apos;s star of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , how , when and why stars leave their rot@@ ational rates down and so to speak their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star comes from
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of base to base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 years old pro , on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays will carry the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say to &quot; Goo@@ dbye &quot; , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under one @-@ year @-@ year contract has been held by 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - with full content . &quot;
as player paid there Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ us &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ ang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed a few milestones . &quot;

&quot; however , in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old may not be recorded . &quot;
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star gave the &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to be missed between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was imprisoned in the so @-@ called biogas sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to have received the main suspected of years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a legal dispute the sper@@ re was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , for I have played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said then . &quot;
even his farewell days do not go out loud .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot;

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first dop@@ ing incidents &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dil@@ uted , wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ters for Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski will not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught Ath@@ ene would have won almost a medal .
&quot; in front of the seventh competition day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es announced the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre gaz@@ ing in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish weights were tested in Brazil , and excluded immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages are coming to the in@@ age . &quot;
Ch@@ en has already been proven the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ cot for dop@@ ing instances .
the International Sport@@ Tribunal @-@ CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon by exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds , it missed the bronze medals . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en could have participated in the courses about 50 m fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demanded by Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; zi@@ ated X@@ in@@ hua &quot; &quot; of a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Tribunal &apos;s CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS of the sanctions with positive cases is responsible . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news passed over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act on the forbidden substance by the EP@@ O &apos;s blood @-@ offering . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was originally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample also has to be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported to say immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ lon .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we Bulgarian are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , about all weights from the chronic dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympics , was tested up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested three days before positive to the an@@ abo@@ de ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association I@@ AF had prohibited the complete Russian team until an exception because of systematic de@@ op@@ ings , the start is prohibited , even the L@@ lo@@ w@@ nation Kenya , produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the earlier surve@@ yed in China had also taken care of the athletes . &quot;
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ans Sun Yang hard .
&quot; sun Yang ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the center of an examination with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships positive to the stimul@@ ant of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only had a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ ma@@ sen h@@ asti@@ se her ran@@ som
programmer from Er@@ press@@ ation mal@@ ware currently rely on companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the Mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes several victims of attack with black@@ mail@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the goal of a mar@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators specialised their black@@ mail@@ - software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to generate ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , Mar@@ cin C@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
&quot; only private used the target , but the change to company attacks was stag@@ gering over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it seeks specifically changed files like Word@@ Press@@ , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos . &quot;
&quot; these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware , and del@@ etes the origin@@ als . &quot;
then the software presents the demands of black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; to get the end turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need to make money - mostly in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private use the personal photo database is at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is imp@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware falls . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop the business operation completely , in a case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many hospitals have been victims of attacks which may be threatened by the loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators due to stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researcher of F @-@ Secure the commercial la@@ wns and the contact with the creators examined and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to make more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrifices by chat , as they can pay with Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will redeem your data after payments of a few hund@@ red@@ ths , businesses must pay partially tough and five digit amounts to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , the h@@ acker becomes more professional and divide the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their contam@@ in@@ ants then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous Mal@@ ware kits were produced by purchased Mal@@ ware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a adap@@ tations tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then look for more h@@ ackers in order to spread the newly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the sub@@ strate , buy the set of a criminals and asked another way to install the software on as many PCs possible . &quot;
payment is made per batch .
&quot; usually , the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ ammer with the spread &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
&quot; over 50 percent of companies in the company IT leaders trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey , to rep@@ el the ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not provide sufficient threat to successful completion , the perpetrators are instead associated with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential according to type of data is still much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators will continue to take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers as they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control on the Internet .
&quot; in the middle of winter the activ@@ ating heating of such non @-@ aligned heating system could be quite a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ator then instead of heating in the future a whole manufacturing road in a factory , ran@@ som@@ ware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the fur . there is no place in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is there anything off . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; there is not only a trunk @-@ room of 4@@ 53 l on high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l ho@@ oked back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ seat can be put up like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel , and thus offer storage space , which is from the ground up to the ceiling : 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well ventil@@ ated , but the charger with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed segments , very powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , he is likely to straigh@@ ten his work qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; pleasing is the everyday life @-@ consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is still another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be more direct .
the equipment is not open to any wishes in the tested top version &quot; Executive . &quot;
&quot; among the security systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bra@@ king &apos;s assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision system and the trace super@@ visor . &quot;
the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he assessed many obstacles in the ran@@ ting many obstacles as &quot; heart@@ ann@@ ul@@ ating objects . &quot;

and the intelligent temp@@ o re@@ acts to the ti@@ lt detection and rot@@ ting when needed the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for top facilities : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline starting from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ exhau@@ st standard .

Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passenger
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger .
&quot; the liability is conceivable only at dangers , which are typical of air traffic , argued the National Court of DÃ¼sseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken out at the fall of a knee br@@ other@@ ness .
&quot; however , the accident had to happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease case : when does the organizer pay
ill holiday@@ makers get back money after their trip if the cause of the disease is doubt@@ lessly found at the hotel .
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the sealed case , a family was heavy on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ ur@@ lau@@ b hard to diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ lage that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the journey had been fla@@ wed with it - and def@@ endant against the promot@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
indeed the se@@ wage plant was indeed def@@ ective .
but the promot@@ er was only briefly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information duties , thus the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the rehear@@ s@@ als of the water no im@@ pur@@ ities were found .

from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 sick .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re said , according to the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in WÃ¼r@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worry about further attacks . &quot;
the state was to be p@@ onder@@ ed and decided at the same time to counter terrorism .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and acquisitions . &quot;
this triumph we will not give the terrorists .
&quot; when offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , the level of security and force will also increase the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re wants to implement the proposals until the election of the German Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , namely in medium @-@ sized scale over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is supposed to be improved , the ceas@@ e@@ fire to be implemented so that especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is created . &quot;
&quot; the most recently discussed welding for doctors shall remain , according to de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨res words . &quot;
&quot; however , in dialogue with the off@@ ender af@@ t , he wants to search for solutions such as the threat to citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of some mental abnorm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social care to be necessary . &quot;
teachers have to be better prepared to deal with traumati@@ sed people .
&quot; to the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is planning to investigate the deployment of an investigation . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is willing to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against shareholder . &quot;
&quot; that was an ear for the sni@@ ff in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ation ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality previously rejected .
a general ban of the en@@ closure is he held for constitutional problems .
&quot; you can not for@@ bid it all that one re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;

better traffic @-@ flow on the Autobahn
a regular basis on the road @-@ road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this is to change : the legal deduc@@ tions should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the car drivers who stand in traffic on the road road every night in the traffic road , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; inland operations , on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th and 17th of August ) in the area between the hammer street and the departure from the V@@ ale road to the legality road at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then slide directly from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic will be charged at the earliest , making the overall validity section of the Bundes@@ straÃe 51 improved . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of MÃ¼nster @-@ West .
driving on the train ride is ener@@ v@@ ating the motor@@ ists in particular between 17 and 19 hrs .
on week@@ days the back from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ west path and sometimes also beyond .
this is why the needle is at the B 51 shortly before the exit road .
&quot; from here , traffic is driven only one lane over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be re @-@ built a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge is no longer the necessary capacity , above all to absorb heavy traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ pass and the connected daily St@@ au will last will not tell , the office will not be able to say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on , because the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal deduc@@ tions , the state is deliberately selected the traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities to reck@@ on . &quot;
the traffic will be guided on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
cross @-@ cultural journey : cultural events for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school attended the theatre piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos; s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; the N@@ ima N@@ ima association provides young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre MÃ¼nster . &quot;
in the context of the &apos; Inter@@ cultural Travel &apos; the &apos; Inter@@ cultural journey &apos; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years old the staging at the Little House .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes as part of this project cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class had come to MÃ¼nster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the cens@@ orious images and video animations it had been possible to follow , however , to follow the course of action , so the press release of the young theatre . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from spra@@ y@@ cles , and the young theater will work together within the upcoming season during a music theatre . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background are to be maintained between 14 and 20 years old , professionally managed in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ al language courses are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; given the raised refugee numbers , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of constellation : hope to repair @-@ repair
the weather has made the star @-@ sn@@ ap @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany during the night to Friday a stand by the invoice - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was well suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is meant to be good , then we &apos;ll definitely see a lot of ast@@ ero@@ oms on the sky . &quot;
&quot; the constellation are Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to the fastest star @-@ sn@@ aps with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is located in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; during the evening , one desc@@ ends itself , at night you are awake again , in the morning it is far from the wake of the wake @-@ up to think no longer of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you are in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about a quarter of adult sle@@ e@@ al disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes may be underlying , emphasized Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter We@@ alth , member of the German Society for Children and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands that is , but the in@@ som@@ nia is never , so an input and a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder . &quot;
&quot; exactly that can sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member of the German household physician , with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; may organic , mental or mal@@ nourished factors , but also drugs . &quot;
not rarely is the in@@ patient expression of another condition .
&quot; very early waking up is especially common in depression , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that various factors thank each other .
&quot; those who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , guarded every two to three hours and begins to greet strongly about everyday problems and worry , is We@@ alth an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when should I be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well sleeping over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , av@@ enge free . &quot;
&quot; the impairment can be quite different : it is down@@ beat , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ illing fluctu@@ ations or bodily symptoms such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; allevi@@ ate the in@@ con@@ no@@ ises , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; other behavior options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classical sleeping @-@ pills only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , precip@@ it@@ ous dormit@@ ories are barely available in Germany , stresses Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ itÃ© Medical Center of the Char@@ itÃ© University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should first contact the pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian first of sleep problems . &quot;
it can clear with examinations whether the problems have a bodily cause .
&quot; who should be into the sleeping lab , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for instance in the sleeping laboratory doctors , for example , with snoring with respir@@ ations , in case of disease @-@ fatigue , or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
I really don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after c@@ abling , one goes into the bed of his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des at the body , one carries a nose @-@ sleeve , a chest strap and a ant@@ enn@@ ae on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterised at the ceiling . &quot;
how can people affected the trouble get a handle ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws on which one can apply for a better sleep .
&quot; wh@@ ites count on : regular sleep and up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol and avoid at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German float Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed itself by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world ch@@ ord at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athle@@ te Markus Dei@@ bler has put themselves in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his / her criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ ans receives 20,000 euros , and a jungle l@@ ame was 15@@ 0.000 â¬ , no one should wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see or operate on the topic of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ r had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
that is how you should keep it with countries too .

airport : ban@@ ces of Car@@ th@@ iev@@ es arrested
professional Die@@ be at the Airport DÃ¼sseldorf
&quot; civil servants of the DÃ¼ssel@@ dor@@ fer , succeeded in the detention of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ ch@@ susp@@ ects had committed as a ban@@ de several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants involved in the area of DÃ¼sseldorf Congress held a gang that was known to the poli@@ cem@@ an of past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had been committed several delicacies since mid @-@ July this year and were very professionally managed .
&quot; the specialists of the criminal kom@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 may have entered the th@@ iev@@ es , who had travelled to Germany to acc@@ use criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; in this process , they had a total of over 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den@@ ies , meanwhile a rest of the cob@@ bled pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in works at first glance , however , the police matters them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk along the road from east to west , one gets along the places , a fres@@ hed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the fron@@ tage of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; j@@ umped .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ d@@ l who will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments will be created . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in calls , are however preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented apartments , but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin internal vene@@ er Hen@@ kel had spoken several times for a hard approach to the police against the project , the region called &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as a starting @-@ point autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , which were cleared , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled the police three weeks official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , sper@@ sed parts of the street and kept visitors away from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown domestic owners are the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July the Berlin Court of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and the construction workers went under the j@@ ubil@@ ant of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peaceful : parents go with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about vor@@ y Sp@@ Ã¤t@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a basic school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main inhabitants of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , which draws three children here mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the household projects , they share the care of increasing r@@ ents and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound according to a pine that had a majority of political protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ing left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between house occupied and their neighbours , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &apos; district , which also has a lower average income in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; domestic occup@@ ations and the resulting living projects are already long in the neighbourhood : in 1990 , numerous homes have been occupied in the former GDR , including the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was abandoned with a large police fire , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them the inhabitants of the GDR and former house occupied their p@@ aves . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the lease , which has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it in prec@@ ep@@ ted sli@@ ces or freshly made fac@@ ades that were thrown with color @-@ explo@@ sions .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason that not all neighbours are seen as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body lesi@@ ons are directed almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
the most significant part of the criminal off@@ ences make reasons for the crimes that tended to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental building next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; for the question of violence , it is determin@@ ative : people in the 94 are their neighbours , those are certainly not . &quot;
also the famous fl@@ amm@@ ing cars give it directly to the Rig@@ a@@ er longer anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to the Riga street - and stayed .
&quot; it was also important to her that the inhabitants returned their street : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through spot@@ ting new buildings in former construction gaps that sup@@ press the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I can absolutely not heal . &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if one is never listening to somebody ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for the prot@@ rac@@ ed , who fre@@ t about color @-@ bombs , Ker@@ stin has a little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the pine@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; who draws from , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub , there is badly complain about noise . &quot;
all people with first names have asked to not be called with their real name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the matter of integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , she is a social @-@ worker on the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le Deu@@ le the refugee for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the team of management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group of refugee , administr@@ ations , authorities and those else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the work@@ station indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ghty W@@ oll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so some - less spot@@ ting than on the number of areas of task would be pur@@ pose@@ ful - meant , when the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; he has been searching for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the area of social work , just an easy @-@ to @-@ learn v@@ oll@@ is@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central area , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with the local people on the ground and behind the scenes , as well as networking . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place for the period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le ven@@ - and full @-@ time actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and minor problems , organizational , human and insur@@ g@@ ation problems . &quot;
soon new containers are standing in the washing @-@ corner
&quot; a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting persons who have been recognized . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for connection with the connection .
you have to place the refugees in their own or rented residential areas .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or restoration of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the administrative office at the Comm@@ une and the job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for quite some time than very difficult .
de facto administration has no private apartments .
&quot; so far , it is not working so you should rely on private apartments , so deu@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments have to be squee@@ zed as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are soon set up in the washing @-@ street .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keywords , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ t agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent lead , it is tra@@ ine@@ eship , training places , school @-@ jobs , one @-@ euro jobs and work @-@ activities for refugees and migrants that need to be de@@ ple@@ ted or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many are working in the building yard or help us master , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community has a positive effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , this activity does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say deu@@ ce and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , we have to jump with administration and volunteers . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it takes , and they can make it sensible at the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will have the feeling that it might be able to help in Ur@@ bach anyone , do not work and be un@@ selfish , which will never integrate itself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but problem cases also exists , says the customer honestly , &quot; people where nothing goes . &quot; the work of deu@@ ction and customer is therefore always to motivate others to motivate . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two of the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly what may be called naive naive and doesn &apos;t want to exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers were already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
&quot; they would have the fear , that the attacks bring them completely into dis@@ assembly . &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and community of volunteers must be looking for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in this context , they are always in the background that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants would come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , do not shy away from politics . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put it on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we would like , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ s are already loaded with it , which are fully integrated to the people so far . &quot;
&quot; this is currently around 100 people , mostly young males . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , since there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : dri@@ er looking for helicopter
the police helicopter flew for about one hour and different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are over@@ flowing in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house at 8.@@ 50 clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants of surprised the two and stroke the fal@@ si@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ hed , both blue@@ berries and black cap pul@@ ses . &quot;
they escaped in the direction of the city .
&quot; to the flag@@ ging , the police put several stri@@ ps and a police helicopter . &quot;
the fet@@ us ran without success .
perhaps the unkno@@ wns were in fact close to the apartment or on their flight .
