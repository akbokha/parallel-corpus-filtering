<seg id="11">"he let himself run with his family over the plant of the ALRV on a horse, he didn't even get a photo for photo."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was very convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe exceeded the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sportpyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">At awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"federal agencies, silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour of the year..."</seg>

<seg id="19">At Aachen he met the first prize for Hans Günter Winkler.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporty successes but also for social engagement."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clin's and Trumps policy compared to: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - they want both the Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policies between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the, on the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and be warned of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to put the economy to death and regulate them to death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return to regulations, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax approaches - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the contrary, says: the State has certain tasks to fulfil; he has a disadvantage for it and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore the taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton have almost wordless."</seg>
<seg id="14">Democratic evaluation at all announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly opposed by the state-critical Teapy wings of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump you might still be in internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">"more clearly, the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident."</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and drive coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil funding should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demands renewable energies with its investment programme:" "a country becomes the superpower of Clean Energy and create millions of jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US want to isolate not from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better then, for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise her up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be rinsed, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, so the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to at least demand from the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="13">Until one speaks to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and among other things deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are swept.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich's North in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all-lying women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January Condrobs made up the set up, together with Pro Familia and the Munich's Women's Aid Association."</seg>
<seg id="18">Long ago it has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here on their escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families want to send them to Europe as hoppers."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women outweigh other reasons for the run:" many steal themselves secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary patronage, slavery or obsessive prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving it away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs are demanding for example for a bottle of water a sexual act, is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, be reborn."</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here the women-related women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and worst if abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in Munich's North in Munich, are traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children were certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so accustomed to nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experiences, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't help themselves, they need more accommodations only for them, calls for danger."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District Apostles are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, some answer with No."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are such a thing in shelters of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben are not accommodated alone, women-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unterer and Mittelfranken there are some common floors or own homes just for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that has been published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>

<seg id="46">"all the washrooms should be separately accessible and easily accessible for women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel in need of this protective need, you can read the crush that there is on the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Russia and Turkey: an" "alliance of foreign side" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met in Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish bacth in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in receipt, I cannot repel the expression that Ankara wants to say this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile had a malignant, and he shining barely warmth, even for his withstanding relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin, according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day described a newspaper, that Erdogan was so doing so as if never wanted to happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">Seemed to me his enthusiasm rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin exhilarating, sustainable coolness showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory courses at the border of a Russian fighter ship at the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was walled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to have fallen back to Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decay was even bigger as it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is difficult to rebuild the cousin if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the stately controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time the Turks seemed to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious officials were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so-called" "Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was only held because Putin received the apology from the President Erdogan whom he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends who he can get after he was relieved at a failed coup in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be easier when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">These are counting on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week projected the coutries to see cheap fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulate it:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as the reaction to the tried to take power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing Groll is about the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian President in Ankara won a bonus for him to have demanded support for the elected government bodies after the attempted coup."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-remembered for Moscow - a matter of course that has changed a deep-sitting fear of regiment.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed it to represent Russia and Turkey, one, as it once described a analyst," "alliance of outer sideways": two countries, who are chaired from West and poorly treated and now disconnecting. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given itself the role of a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey can support contradictory pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talk, both Presidents said at the press conference, they had not even roams the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey criticised it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unambiguous consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least been talking again."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the renowned National Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="21">But the official allegation - that a man who once was appointed as potential President to once lead to Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks about Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "Ivanov" "is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - one could almost say - trusting positions for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was deputy prime minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin's former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted."</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term putted against the Constitution.</seg>

<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand was something in the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been moved by massive demand that overbursts the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the miracle full of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there is also murderous game-corruption, who always have to complain about something."</seg>

<seg id="2">A british traveller underwent his immune system and litre-lex of a serious test - by going out some of the most filly and ecclesiashing places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and Travel tor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk slipped his course on a Euro-Schein, a railknob of a tractor toilette, as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the leaps of each object, he used a Luminometer for himself and to show us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filtered under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the washing button of a train toilette blade, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with physicians and medical specialists about the promotion of bowel bacteria, as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left, what he stretched out, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestinal by travelling through the world, as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to rinscracks of restrooms, the task laid down its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told me:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health affects and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms, and samming water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely righteous.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test-line showed a magnifier number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometers of fresh-driven hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to cut off after its Luminometers over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products deliver the travel efilm" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says:" "this comes the worst that I have rolled in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not reveal nothing here, because it is here indoors."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturers of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company shaded Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both military-bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bowel bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Sweet President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to really offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy brainstormings that ended with it, that we said" Lass us Ian. "</seg>
<seg id="26">Affirm that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead, instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our day-to-day environment, the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added:" let me have lost my respect for Ian when he would have stuck my respect for Ian, as the ekelective Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things, in which it was easier to bring Ian to put her and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Validation 84 per cent of all respondents, in particular with the well-being of stomach and bowel and 58 percent, they said that they at least use products, which contain anxactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you become the comment of the comment, in order to cut it under the pseudonym nonAlleEinsampler's age with rough insults, this statement leads from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplication of sound sheets does not want to welcome a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the new unity of physical objects, but on Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all predictions according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: the older records are keeping their feelings more likely (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"when this blog was a news report on television, I would follow the camera, while in the middle of a busy road in Soho lead, a modest gray suit and wild while I steal, my hands and something determined, like" "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slow on his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and soul."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men aged) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, one woman, probably about the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not ask him home), dress up the walls of his room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford, when they appeared and re-buy objects, which he sold, when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70ies who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, when I was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who are buying records, are more introverted and like to spend alone time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I drink not much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and can see themselves again to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually got rid of them in 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to get back their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to recognize that record stores provides a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customer participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat back to the stability of confidential sound records, of objects, the happy jubilations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions, as a kind of comfort," says NEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "comfy a staff of a record pile."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM revealed in April that almost 50% of the people, who bought a record last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I blocker with a stack to Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged) has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," I do not have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it's definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musician."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who are slowly coming slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, which has dedicated the gramophone almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos make teenager and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts new synthesizers and sexbegrabbing pop instead of experimental jazz blend out of the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them sees sonodly, but nave mental traumas are hard to detach if one stands next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around a few minutes in business and considers the variation of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shop hereditary than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collection of plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I want to give the impression, the jeans-hotly mix, I watched a group of young teenagers, who group himself for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter imagine a Crosley turntables."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it itself - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to use them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "label art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"considering that any attraction for these items can mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my studies have occurred that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record business and in online research."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the stroll through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while taking the rigidity of an uncanny, 30-year-year false moderator, that overlooks the shoulders of nothing of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="9">"because frequently, social and family structures emerge at age, an choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also done Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together.</seg>

<seg id="28">"you don't sings alone - with 50 sinful people, who even sounds when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, seniors have different opportunities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the acquaintances in a housing, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities are also offering views of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">"who wants to sing in an ecclesiastic choir, can turn directly to the church or the Church."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many people of seniors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="2">"after several offices, the constitutional archer in the federal government also provided the group under observation."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see in the 'identity movement' approach for aspirations against the freedom of democratic principles," said constitutionality Hans-Georg Maate of the German press-Agency in Berlin. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"thus, immigration of other Islamic faith or the Middle East are being diffused in extremist way."</seg>
<seg id="5">That's why we are watching the movement as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" "identity movement" "is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns against "Multikulti-Wahn;" an uncontrollable mass migration "and the" loss of one's own identity by estrangement. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the" Identity. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maate said, his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'identity movement' try to pick up their target group, where it stands," "said the Constitutional Court."</seg>
<seg id="11">"generally try extremists to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The people of Islamists just like right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is not good advertising for their own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda is said to address people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are very susceptible in a special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"recently, several federal states had given reports of" "identity" "to AfD-politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not have a knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"however, for the constitutional protection, the possible contact of this kind may only be relevant to a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain individuals, which are extremist, their target device is changing and so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is, therefore, whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase of criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers, and refugees said Maate, he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that there can be extreme frozen structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the free group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may be quite possible that further justifiable groupings or small groups constitute the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee-sheivers or attacks from other far-right motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">A clear or pan-wide control of legality is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"concerned, Mained also expressed that many attacks on the account of men went to appearance before in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the anti-suspects in attacks on asylum seekers have not been known to be criminal, politically motivated or pendant of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many individuals have committed criminal offences that had previously chosen with right wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or elected to the example of CDU, SPD or left wing, who then have radicalised by far-right moods."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is like the olympic Fackel itself is a burning stab, which is passed by the bracelet for swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot turn the television to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in Coffeeshop, without over Simone Biles, Katie Leaders and Chad le Clos to hear."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who, for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female's warm with Grübchen, could certainly have been sent under this known name that would be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-known TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, turner or even fairy."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not appear any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partially in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized: air padding, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I can modest arguments for my particular darling then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline already has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so sparse that many people I ask, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasportant."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline, and had had an athlete until the end of 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider tip, partly because it sounds suitable for an enlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a educated enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports which it is essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"upcoming winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, lifting and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiacegram, they are evaluated according to the execution, difficulty and" "flight time". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight forward.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, upward and out, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and back, down and down in the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the ornamellor, but also the output wall, but also in the television transfer: the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented desire is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir the audience with tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I even consider when looking out of these games as something fatigued.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of these offers the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A moving forward is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she spallt, seemingly weightless like a astronaut, goes up, then gradually below, then effortlessly back to the top."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and ends of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time: the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>

<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators and the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters during the clashes with the police were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government broke out the country and spread more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses passed on that policemen were shot on very unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the area-being videos about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is known to Nigeria the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations, continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, where dissidents were effectively brought into silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in central Ethiopies. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from the ground use until the stranglehold related to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far divergent election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue to rise along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this pronged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which have been more or less imposed in recent years, take advantage of turmoil and be arming again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of prior to quiköchelns are now exploded under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media since cheap smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially at protests, so many people can still communicate via internet-proxies that conceal where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave us that they were gathered together to Protect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons prosperied the Amharas who come from Ethiopia and mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while they are exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Mormos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was to his death on a not publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly wasted in keeping early signs of discontent and use special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this basic skill," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"other than Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region NordäEthiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes out of the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, that Ethiopia was experienced in such turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections were seemingly fueled by the government and were then stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts in Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal failure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protested in Gondar, a amharous city, of Tigray guided shops and the hate towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the U.S. protests and other Western allies hit a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used to be Ethiopia as a basis for Dronage flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it was recently concluded that she concluded that base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West will clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally collapses into a volatile neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin crest."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism, when he said, the Russians ought to hack Mrs. Elisabeth's emails, but later he said" "naturally I said the sarcastic." ""</seg>

<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with a big advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative expressions, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>

<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, whereas the largest 502 centimetres."</seg>

<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lineup.</seg>

<seg id="30">"now, the researchers have to assign the length to an old age."</seg>

<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and to be more quickly evapplaud."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>

<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds that works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average-temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought out a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was thought before planets.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years --zumuch heat and ultra-violet light were exposed."</seg>

<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop the business operation completely, in a case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, many hospitals have been victims of attacks which may be threatened by the loss of hospitals."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pays not, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators due to standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researcher of F-Secure the commercial lawns and the contact with the creators examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to make more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay with Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will redeem your data after payments of a few hundredths, businesses must pay partially tough and five digit amounts to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware-blackmail, the hacker becomes more professional and divide the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is likely that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their contaminants then in the form of a software building to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous Malware kits were produced by purchased Malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a adaptations tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then look for more hackers in order to spread the newly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums in the substrate, buy the set of a criminals and asked another way to install the software on as many PCs possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per batch.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then instruct spammer with the spread", "explains Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">"over 50 percent of companies in the company IT leaders trust in the Malwarebytes survey, to repel the ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scannersoftware."</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not provide sufficient threat to successful completion, the perpetrators are instead associated with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes, Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the damage potential according to type of data is still much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators will continue to take completely new targets on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they could get a thermostat under their control on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter the activating heating of such non-aligned heating system could be quite a ransom." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrator then instead of heating in the future a whole manufacturing road in a factory, ransomware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"during the evening, one descends itself, at night you are awake again, in the morning it is far from the wake of the wake-up to think no longer of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you are in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about a quarter of adult sleeal disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as restful."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes may be underlying, emphasized Hans-Günter Wealth, member of the German Society for Children and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands that is, but the insomnia is never, so an input and a sleepy disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"exactly that can sleep many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German household physician, with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"may organic, mental or malnourished factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the inpatient expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is especially common in depression," says Weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"those who for example has a slipped disk, can be bad, guarded every two to three hours and begins to greet strongly about everyday problems and worry, is Wealth an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should I be with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well sleeping over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day, should go to the doctor, avenge free."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can be quite different: it is downbeat, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has milling fluctuations or bodily symptoms such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"alleviate the inconnoises, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"other behavior options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classical sleeping-pills only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, precipitous dormitories are barely available in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interité Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, one should first contact the paediatrician first of sleep problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clear with examinations whether the problems have a bodily cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should be into the sleeping lab, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for instance in the sleeping laboratory doctors, for example, with snoring with respirations, in case of disease-fatigue, or if you do not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">I really don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after cabling, one goes into the bed of his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes at the body, one carries a nose-sleeve, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger."</seg>

<seg id="6">"reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented apartments, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin internal veneer Henkel had spoken several times for a hard approach to the police against the project, the region called" no-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as a starting-point autonomous force."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, which were cleared, with 300 police officers, patrolled the police three weeks official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, spersed parts of the street and kept visitors away from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown domestic owners are the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July the Berlin Court of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and the construction workers went under the jubilant of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peaceful: parents go with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about vory Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a basic school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main inhabitants of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, which draws three children here mainly from the police presence."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between house occupied and their neighbours, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers' district, which also has a lower average income in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"domestic occupations and the resulting living projects are already long in the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous homes have been occupied in the former GDR, including the entire Mainzer street near the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was abandoned with a large police fire, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them the inhabitants of the GDR and former house occupied their paves."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the lease, which has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes it in precepted slices or freshly made facades that were thrown with color-explosions.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason that not all neighbours are seen as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body lesions are directed almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>

<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rental building next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for the question of violence, it is determinative: people in the 94 are their neighbours, those are certainly not."</seg>

<seg id="31">"it was also important to her that the inhabitants returned their street: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deule is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the matter of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, she is a social-worker on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deule Deule the refugee for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the team of management at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group of refugee, administrations, authorities and those else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the workstation indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deule is now there, the eighty Wollmilksau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so some - less spotting than on the number of areas of task would be purposeful - meant, when the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he has been searching for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the area of social work, just an easy-to-learn vollissau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not their central area, writes Annika Deule."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with the local people on the ground and behind the scenes, as well as networking."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place for the period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deule ven- and full-time actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and minor problems, organizational, human and insurgation problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the washing-corner</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting persons who have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connection with the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to place the refugees in their own or rented residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of building, rent or restoration of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office at the Commune and the jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for quite some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto administration has no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not working so you should rely on private apartments, so deuction."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments have to be squeezed as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are soon set up in the washing-street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keywords, Regine customer and Annika Deut agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent lead, it is traineeship, training places, school-jobs, one-euro jobs and work-activities for refugees and migrants that need to be depleted or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many are working in the building yard or help us master, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deule."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community has a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, this activity does not only mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say deuce and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, we have to jump with administration and volunteers."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain to the refugees that it takes, and they can make it sensible at the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will have the feeling that it might be able to help in Urbach anyone, do not work and be unselfish, which will never integrate itself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but problem cases also exists, says the customer honestly," people where nothing goes. "the work of deuction and customer is therefore always to motivate others to motivate."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two of the recent occurrences fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer very clearly what may be called naive naive and doesn't want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers were already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"they would have the fear, that the attacks bring them completely into disassembly."</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and community of volunteers must be looking for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in this context, they are always in the background that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants would come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, do not shy away from politics."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put it on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived in Urbach where we would like," "says Annika Deule."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urs are already loaded with it, which are fully integrated to the people so far."</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently around 100 people, mostly young males."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, since there are no simple answers."</seg>
