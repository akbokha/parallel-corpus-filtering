Obama to receive Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and oppose Teheran &apos;s destabil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
&quot; but at the meeting , it is also a matter of conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the constant settlement of Israel and raises the lack of participation in the process of peace .
&quot; by the deal of Obama &apos;s deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , I had held a controversial speech at the invitation of Re@@ public@@ ans before the US Congress , which was judged as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; speaking to Obama was not dis@@ spoken with Obama , a meeting had refused to be forthcoming at the time of his election in Israel . &quot;
in an emergency professor he conf@@ uses his girlfriend
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon told him a somewhat disturbed voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he was very important to emphas@@ ise that his &apos; sweet dog &apos; still live and probably was excited , and he said the family @-@ contacts of dead women could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ en@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cro@@ oked on a white bloc : &quot; I didn &apos;t do it , I loved him , I loved him . this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was not signed by him . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles for school education , E@@ than Schmidt , shot and killed in his office according to the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ v@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the sh@@ out at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he had done the fatal ma@@ ids immediately after that .
&quot; by the end of the day , there was another death . the Lamb took the life , when the police officers . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what he has motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details issued by investig@@ ators on both ends of the state as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were rejo@@ iced on their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a story of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself was mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both established them in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher has 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb tells him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University for a doctor of health reasons and said that he had some health problems .
this year he made only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in employment policies of the university signi@@ fied that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard for him , would represent no guarantee of an automatic route to an assignment as Assistant Assistant . &quot;
&quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he know nothing of a conflict between he and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer any more .
after the flight out of the campus the police took Lam@@ bs lane when he was back into Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as import@@ ation .
&quot; before he could be arrested , le@@ ased himself self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home @-@ home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he graduated in spring in education .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs welcomed him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Mr H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met together through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach them guitar . &quot;
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted to the former if he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on inhab@@ itable . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ en@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building which is adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ en@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
he met Pr@@ en@@ ss as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both of them during the summer of three years ago .
later they played together one or another G@@ ig .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ en@@ ss was a nurse , which worked for various companies online . &quot;
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ arten@@ ders and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ ement coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak @-@ lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ics anticip@@ ation before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign of anything that something was not agreed .
&quot; simply just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the end and greeted with each other .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt called the t@@ ote Professor , directed the first semester @-@ seminar program and specialized on American ab@@ orig@@ ines and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday night in Cle@@ veland , on Tuesday night about 900 people , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community in a candle light ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Mah@@ n@@ guard , during the University of Li@@ ves &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans bore to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police said now that he made the emergency call , after he called his rep@@ aid , and that lamb re@@ inde@@ b@@ ished by his emergency as his wife , but there is no indication that the two would have mar@@ ries . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us is planning to invest less labour for Christmas time

Michael J. Fox Bl@@ iss his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater wait for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty , and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated bal@@ ed and a measuring length of it , with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;

UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s greater military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chef will once again call for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and promote inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the General Assembly still this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; it de@@ pl@@ ated that spl@@ its up in the Council and within the Syrian people and of the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , having proved them in achieving a nuclear de@@ crimin@@ ation with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks with surveys down , it has ( yet ) did not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of Real Estate &apos;s Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ising the fact that at that time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been handed over to rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ ward @-@ groups such as Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps in per@@ sever@@ ance and start to flow its dollars to overthrow him . &quot;
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
fer@@ umps Beli@@ ar levels have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump had announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University , that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans had seen the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten they say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
one Quin@@ cer@@ pi@@ ac tuning in Iowa has found that 60 per cent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week , 67 per cent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; , &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say , they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which can tell the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans sees the temper@@ ament of temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the public@@ ans reg@@ isters Irish re@@ public@@ ans believe that the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is given in the first op@@ tionally state of the nation , the federal state Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament &apos;s not into the White House , so ABC / Mail . &quot;
Re@@ public@@ s voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when she put her scholar@@ ship , Republi@@ can voters , Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked for who winning the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a change since the time when four out of ten ended their money at Je@@ b Bush .
complete revelations : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ine in the past .
&quot; at this time last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans were told that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates , Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ umps campaign was plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the Republi@@ can gather around one other candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the spl@@ itter field is likely to contribute to m@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used for more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September demonstrates that , in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will appoint multi @-@ health support . &quot;
&quot; shortly before C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , recently score 15 points , recently An@@ b Bush 19 points and eventually left edge Paul , John Ka@@ herself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
there is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans tells you their opinion was formed .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support the dump , say they have chosen their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can truly say the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said , that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps sharp@@ est competition in the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with trend in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called two months &quot; immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; the immigration of immigration was a ful@@ crum at the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic forms of expression of Tr@@ ump pi@@ erc@@ ano American remot@@ ely hold on by the Republi@@ can Party and def@@ ends the new @-@ oriented effort .
&quot; however , after the new ABC / Post survey conducted by Monday six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans that they have coinci@@ de with questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , there will be Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too . &quot;
the frustration on the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , about half of the support from Republi@@ can voters , mainly by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans are saying in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Mail , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines tab / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Republi@@ can public@@ ans in congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ king road there is the most expensive urban@@ ization - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ e@@ watt .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a bed @-@ house on average is 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers will cost one square meter on the majority .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really very little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top areas , one of the prices comes along as pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
doubts Tor@@ ri@@ e in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a course .
a lucky event by Thomas Müller on the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a sovereign resolution of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ tz@@ e have taken a dream start to the &quot; mission Milan &quot; for FC Bayern in the Wit@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Piraeus . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her launch in the Champions League at the Greek record Olympic Games in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers pi@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol @-@ hand ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starter set in series is meant to be the first step in the final direction of the final on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the Hen@@ ro@@ pot@@ t from Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller received at his 28 February in the Champions League for the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , which allowed one as a bul@@ let &apos;s shot of the World &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; we are not under@@ estimate &quot; , &quot; had promised US captain Philipp L@@ ame in front of the game at the Car@@ ais@@ k@@ akis &quot; Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and received the Munich &apos;s Word . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and committed vision , without breaking . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his youngest six @-@ hits in the royal class , among them against reputable clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 he also stum@@ bled here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bayern , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly , with their offensive efforts but often to resour@@ ce@@ ful works . &quot;
the attacks were often introduced by the si@@ ege against Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa which was rarely crossed by the former Braunschwei@@ g Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller had more luck on the right side , when his side struck out of the right half @-@ field in the left corner . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ vi@@ owski .
initially at first presents the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown the head ball of the Poles from the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by direct transfer , the Tor@@ were Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
although the Bayern her lived in the dominant play could put Piraeus &apos;s needle .
but in ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was Lost .
about as he set a shot of ide@@ ye by the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola allowed a qu@@ artet with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in Ka@@ der , sat first outside . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ WC @-@ hero was given first light after the final trial , &quot; said spor@@ ty@@ pe@@ writer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ignant . &quot;
&quot; also at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he was king King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the buried Le@@ ave . ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , per El@@ f@@ meters made Müller a fall . &quot;
in front of the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly alleged Bayern @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator @-@ Block apparently had prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went ahead with p@@ aves against the Munich &apos;s followers . &quot;
at least one Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; to those who smo@@ kes , thereby not only the lungs but also the teeth - that lies a central Pots@@ dam@@ er Long study . &quot;
good news : in case of zi@@ cht the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this will be presented from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Studies ( DI@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers was going to lose the risk of losing their teeth in order to lose the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes for tooth failure , tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is smoking a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth@@ loss is therefore lower than frequent g@@ um kin@@ da for smokers .
&quot; it is not clear to what extent , smoking is also increased the risk of tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who listened to smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; it could however last more than ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; Er@@ go@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich declared by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it takes up people to convince humans to become non @-@ smoking , &quot; leader of a Boeing by DI@@ RE@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking cuts the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and results according to our findings also a good dental health to the high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population are affected by the age of 65 to 74 years of dental , the DI@@ E share . &quot;
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study bonds the findings .

&quot; the controversial private arbitration centres for disputes between companies and states are expected to be solved by a transpar@@ ant system , which clearly corresponds to a considerably more traditional dishes in its way . &quot;

&quot; the Swedish , in front of the proposal as a European negotiating position , has entered the US &apos;s trade agreements with the United States . &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; TTIP is supposed to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people . &quot;
plans to re@@ forming the current arbitration proceedings show clearly that the EU states and the United States choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against judgment claim .
&quot; until now , the process of procedures performed among each other with arbitr@@ ator , an in@@ consistency of their judg@@ ments did not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and fairness , commented Malm@@ ström had . &quot;
&quot; in the long run , it wants to work according to its own statements on an International Investment Court . &quot;
there may also be certain differences between Chinese companies and EU countries as an example .
the investor @-@ state arbitration demanded above all by major @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbitr@@ al tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ z , on the companies slo@@ wing damages to tax@@ payers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act expressed the proposals from the EU Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it was critic@@ ised that they are not intended for the negotiated agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
the German economic multi @-@ Secretary of Matthias Mach@@ in@@ tim@@ ately ( SPD ) signed the plans in contrast as major progress .
&quot; the Commission considered essential points , Federal Minister of Foreign Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ ration is from the table .
also the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE was warned of limiting the pi@@ ge@@ ways of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be disadvantaged in this manner .
&quot; when talks about the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , continued to remain unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States so far . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of that year . &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the former prime minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in at the carriage of the Prime Minister with excitement expected
&quot; the new Labour @-@ president Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ en should give his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister , and create it with David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will stand up to post the first of its six @-@ given questions shortly after noon but is likely to investigate his performance by the media and the Labour MEPs from the near future .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he has also said that he could jump in some sessions to leave their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s leadership , for it comes to a member of the shadow of the shadow and after his speech at the TU@@ C &apos;s Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leaders took place in silence during the singing of National An@@ them during a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ated the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence and is at the core of several front page stories in newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s decision not to sing the National An@@ them has attracted attention
he told Mr Cor@@ by@@ en : he would have been &quot; in respectful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ S Shadow cab@@ in@@ eton , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news@@ night program , he told the Labour Party to sing the national anth@@ ems , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow bonds have refused to serve to Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s peak team , and they are called to differences in economics , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliament@@ arian party took him to support him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ tic Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences could be st@@ acking also within the Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acks &quot; &quot; and on Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour has been put forward to remove the whole idea of a restriction .
&quot; s Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and R@@ ent ministers , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only possible for the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds on 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour @-@ Chair with David Cameron since he is a T@@ ory leader over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy of policy , says he said &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the leader of the Prime Minister is to confront , and that he will refrain from &quot; impact strength &quot; and the struggle with bar@@ bed hoo@@ ks , and instead , focused on serious problems like poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of management is represented in it , if he is not participating - for instance , Mr Cameron is abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally grasp the Word , and that he John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , talked to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was awarded the leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is connecting from the policy in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; , &quot; which often is linked to the former prime minister . but a few years later he took a little , he failed . &quot;

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ Plak@@ at carries out Lebanese on mas@@ hed &apos;s idea
potatoes or don@@ er ?
&quot; it goes both - and in the potato d@@ um , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; &quot; potato &quot; , &quot; on a poster the p@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement has put Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat together for a bite . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally seen on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue which has been fitted in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multicul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has registered in the spirit of Leb@@ esis in the meantime at the patent offices in Munich .
&quot; there , according to the authority of the authority , it has recently been protected as manual patterns . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes contains the sp@@ it , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary international understanding is very good . &quot;
met@@ cash starts soil @-@ speed campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - fall @-@ up
Met@@ cash seeks to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a bottom @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million of Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia are preparing to strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and expand the brand of Ig@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores , and shop owners , which sell tickets for the South Australian football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that met@@ rology further details of its defensive strategy will be published on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler carries out its annual Invest@@ ors &quot; Day on the 29th September . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake since South Australia and Western Australia make almost 30 percent of met@@ a &apos;s Ig@@ A cargo business , and higher profits than met@@ a &apos;s Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East @-@ East states . &quot;
&quot; purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and Ig@@ A retailer holds a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared with about 14 per cent in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; but analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its initial market will grab some five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent of retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 $ million could lose revenues per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this prognosis was based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in W@@ A next year and will generate annual sales of € 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
loss in food and grocery across the amounts to met@@ a &apos;s high f@@ x@@ cost basis Met@@ cash could cost roughly 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes - Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ Single is the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that met@@ a &apos;s turnover in food and food business increased by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business meeting in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will likely disappear inside a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week made contact .
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent for 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ hes food and food trading , which has about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailer , has been provided by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting their operating debt down@@ wards on turnover and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ al@@ ers attract , however , and inv@@ ests more than 150 million US $ , to deliver sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ vo@@ ths about hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores from fast growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price customiz@@ ations and loading programs to El@@ an will acquire and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profitability for the first time in four years , for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ asi Co@@ in@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ aki deserve rather praise than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Than@@ x Kok@@ kin@@ aki was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ aki , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; special K@@ s , &quot; got through the in@@ famous argument of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ aki and his opponent Ry@@ an Harrison was separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Harrison : W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to hit K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; last seen , as he last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f was rob@@ bery of a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , was defended by Kok@@ en@@ akis by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic , in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I fix me pretty much is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi has been raised a little bit in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat , when he lost due to a cl@@ amping in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust , with himself , and I know Than@@ x good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , it has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US @-@ Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison , and so on and I think he deserved a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I think he was treated a little too hard . &quot;
&quot; he is a very hard 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he is working in the team and so on , he has never seen a problem with the other players , he is trained in the locker area , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take account of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os on the important pre@@ decision taken on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all but it secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controllers around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick felt very quickly made Ascension , which made people like fe@@ ather and Mur@@ ray . he climb@@ s up in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him . some time outside the lim@@ elight in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency crisis , closes the border with holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and took the border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all who tried to go illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a kidney and Serbian officials with outra@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; people who were fled from violence , hidden for an un@@ familiar time in a landing at the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them sh@@ ed@@ te , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled insul@@ ts against the Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
some presented to protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister explained that &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that immigrants were returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral harm .
&quot; during the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the non @-@ Ser@@ b border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels made no joint immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who would have been refuge in the over@@ l@@ umped Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be concluded that the EU states more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the continent crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not hope to return soon to leave Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; the emergency in two southern regions gave governments more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country has also set the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after reaching a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisons in the race , the Stach@@ el@@ ites fence , between Hungary and Serbia , were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has been fighting for many war @-@ people from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Viktor Or@@ ban has ins@@ isted that most of the coming economic migrants are in search of a better life and are not war persons who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary are crossing the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence , which allowed the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher pen@@ alties for do@@ omed people . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said Intergovernmental spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ tern to the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still vote in the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen the border of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated into the country . &quot;
they come across as they def@@ ends the fence ; they are now in police and acc@@ uses the off@@ ences of crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are to fix the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials finally closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train @-@ wagon with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ts the most important fron@@ tier crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and tap the crowds in order to stand there . &quot;
&quot; approximately 20 managed to go up , but thousands have remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants turns the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse to buy food and water till they are travelling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton still holds a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters on the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while in a second position , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not proclaimed whether he entered the Russian Federation , will receive support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the vote . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is firm , which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clin@@ &apos;s supporters are more enduring than those of the other candidates in their election .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders had some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is a big advantage in women and ti@@ lt @-@ trained , but this proj@@ ec@@ aps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s benefits under democratic voters are under 50 years of age , and they are now on equal height . &quot;
Clinton has a big advantage with the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton was a two @-@ point advantage with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ ander now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the national elections were said to support Clinton , if it would be nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some advantages and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ically &apos;s current supporters are especially impressed by her .
the views are more mixed with those who do not want to support Clinton - only about a quarter would help them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters are saying they want to support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters can tell this about its peak run by Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ t supporters can be asked in an open question , why they want them to have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the belief that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
the Bill Clinton facilit@@ ators are also mentioned their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and voters are also cited .
&quot; as Vice President has a potential for the President of the Russian Federation , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the vote would like to see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are asked , who would be their second election for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
by Clin@@ t &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders .
&quot; decides in favor of bi@@ ds , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters want to see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has declined by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in the measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important at a candidate , democratic voters call questions about the vote . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potentially candidate for those voters of the previous election is as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good results with some important characteristics by voters to vote their party elections .
&quot; consider , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership abilities . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds cuts in the three candidates best in honesty , while Clin@@ &apos;s strength is leading . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the election in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements about a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; as you have questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal E @-@ mail address and one server , during the term of the Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced in total . &quot;
but it is a different story in the US public .
&quot; half the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have been worse from the Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is seen by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not keep them for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time 55 per cent of the entitled to be seen in a single source is too honest and not tru@@ stable , and cannot be trusted . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will be good notes on leadership .
&quot; out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush am best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as at Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate of the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is approaching a national survey closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is present at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; the two candidates have in the meantime become half of the vot@@ er &apos;s support in new pol@@ l , and others have dramatically declined . &quot;
Re@@ public@@ s voters support nationwide tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month at 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son ch@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that car@@ son is well received in demographic groups and re @-@ executed a l@@ ump with Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of early Fior@@ ina and Ohio &apos;s Governor John Ka@@ joins , is with Wis@@ cons@@ its governor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
former Florida @-@ governor An@@ h Bush the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are now in third place with 6 % .
the bu@@ ggy at the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he landed at 19 % support among the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one over the last week of rising Car@@ son Tr@@ ump found several side@@ hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to question the m@@ umps of faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaign presence in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even though the peak is measured only in the distance , for swi@@ m@@ ester is already a trip to the Mediterranean to offer even warm water . &quot;
a dip in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short fun at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are deb@@ ited with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a multi @-@ channel ritual for a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders will be filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ SI Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and hesit@@ ated to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police with him . &quot;
officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and had been att@@ ated while he tried to pass over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ SI Brotherhood did not rie@@ ve the emergency number 911 , after the den@@ gue was power@@ less and pur@@ ged an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ lia began to hide and put the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood generally about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tic@@ ulous Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after a car report , Den@@ g was repeated with mu@@ te force injuries by head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 each year to the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members have to be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e received charges due to murder of the third count of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for po@@ z@@ ous attacks and de@@ crimin@@ alisation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the person responsible for the event , but when there &apos;s an organisation that &apos;s officially or in@@ official - this is sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College was prohibited the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; a inser@@ tion will come , and the servant will fall into the balance , ren@@ ditions for bonds will rise , and the economy is moved to a recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long that all last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in the process of how the economy and the financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so much that investors should not focus on them when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Executive at Capital Economics , in a communication to clients . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at too low levels to cause the se@@ is@@ mic shock they seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a based on historical trends which might respond to some areas of the economy :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the withdrawal of inser@@ tions can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth amounts to 12 to 24 months after the first increase was ab@@ err@@ ated , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank @-@ analysts in a recent study to what happens after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually published in the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to inser@@ tion , rather flat in the 250 days after an actual analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock is falling later in the booster cycle and the return starts to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but they often promote ca@@ vities them often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which could not exist before and which could speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely worthy of note is that the gross domestic product is near to its lowest score , when a inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed will be . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , a total of 118 r@@ inser@@ tions saw less than 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , few expect that this will last and expect to Atlanta from Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the F@@ ed whole year for a inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade shows only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the cycles of cycles have taken place at a super @-@ cycle with expon@@ ential momentum in GDP in 1950 and today , and on @-@ rec@@ essions , rec@@ eding up to the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed had been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also volati@@ le as the market under@@ takes a inser@@ tion , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares , when changing its strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in lowering is carried out in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the peak @-@ cycle , the An@@ de@@ app@@ endi@@ x fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the Str@@ ate@@ gen from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause that ren@@ ders will move closer to longer and shorter bonds and lead to a lowering of the curve .
&quot; high@@ ver@@ in@@ trin@@ sic bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones says that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of F@@ ed @-@ Strategy . &quot;
&quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to more stringent monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest have risen , the income go@@ ve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ches have extended and the volati@@ lity is increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that benefit from the larger part of their operations in the US , benefit from interest rates rise and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are deterior@@ ated because an increase of dollars their products on the global market is more expensive and also financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial release , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded enterprises with a steady balance sheet after each of the deposits in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their stocks also exceeded their counterparts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debts will become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure lever , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; he could see profits through higher yields , even if experts are different , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says CEO Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the sender because of its &quot; promises &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is no longer able to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards , and said that they im@@ itate the Br@@ its &quot;
&quot; group colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , the mission of The Voice on and said that this is not so original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns up to Classic FM , claiming a leader in the parliament@@ arians and increases new pressure on the transmitter , demonstrating that he does something that does not do the privacy . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham , also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; dum@@ me &quot; and increasingly to distinguish anymore from his commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I didn &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also led to the BBC Music Awards , which started in December last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , who started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try something else to do - these are two spontaneous examples , in which you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes well ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 to find new music and to order new works , I also consider it really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that would be tougher to engage the audience when it did it in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for taking fire to take the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted The Voice for - the BBC talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall was that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - were produced on special BBC fashion .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; if it starts the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , it refused to exclude the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or give money to other agents for other maintenance formats . &quot;
internet re@@ ments climbed in August on the slower and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online @-@ sales increase three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that black Friday in November has res@@ sed its expenses
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled and many of the main shopping miles in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; but experts say that there are now signs that the online revenues will be st@@ agn@@ ated , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase on the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales representative . &quot;
&quot; he stated that the online sales increased three years ago , when buyer was starting to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , the one thing , and we will perhaps experience that growth continues . &quot;
&quot; the black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the offspring . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases on this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times exceeded the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could be fighting for bar@@ gains , buyers of them could make purchases . &quot;
one study carried out by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium discovered that 5 £ spending was issued a bit longer than 1 £ a .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now performed via Web @-@ Shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of being in the cities .
Muslims buried the in Mecca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family re@@ acts
the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims with the first bur@@ ial moun@@ ts in Mecca through the streets .

&quot; among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane run@@ down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great mosque .
&quot; Saudi officers have already confirmed that the p@@ addle to Mecca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today king Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have been allowed to ste@@ al the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arabic version of the decree was published by the state Saudi press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company would be banned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man wr@@ oth un@@ veil what brought the fall of the sick , which rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the giant @-@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Moslems are in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place in this month . &quot;
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group did not have any statements about the collapse of the crane and their representatives were not at your disposal for an opinion .

&quot; the overthrow of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of each healthy faith . &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
&quot; government officials assigned that 1 Million Re@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the depend@@ ants of the people , and the same amount of permanent wounded . &quot;

&quot; it is said that the British put their h@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform their works in their homes &quot;
&quot; if you are sent off with a hammer or a brush to the con@@ vul@@ ge of walls , you now belong to a minority . &quot;
&quot; British employ more and more arti@@ sans , in order to perform do @-@ it jobs in their homes , thus the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , a new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the sub @-@ markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services to low rates is now outdated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to have 200 more scre@@ e shops to open up on professional tra@@ des@@ men and to close 60 outlets by B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops since eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment the employees weigh the men .
&quot; she said it is necessary to place the growing demographic trends , who have more female single households , who perform more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we need to shift this stronger to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients from women consist of 80 percent of the decisions about buying products by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of just five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index is listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also embr@@ aces their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is nearly the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial management . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and moving , after the group sho@@ ok the costs of leaving the stores . &quot;
&quot; king@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q is having at 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to In@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the National Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian beach @-@ vice @-@ register A@@ I / DO@@ B had to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and secondary education .
the accused did not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with abuse .
&quot; by this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted of the law in May . &quot;
the current process has been postponed .
&quot; according to the pro@@ secutor of the country , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ examination that the def@@ endants were disp@@ osed of money by stat@@ s during the years 2006 to 2011 , via which they were disp@@ osed in to their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage was handled with approximately 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports@@ women are also charged with finance .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the ch@@ op@@ ener of Micha@@ ela San@@ in , headed by Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
this should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that the association was not taken into a part of the association at any time . &quot;
&quot; the sporting functioning had only been calculated and the sports club , for which it has been active from 1982 to 2011 and has invested a lot of time and money from debts - the pas@@ sports carried out in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 bul@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we were standing in front of the situation : let &apos;s lead the club further or lock it up ? &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , at the Br@@ ot@@ ech large @-@ oper@@ and of the financial market . &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused he then decided to assume this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have prescribed money , laid down our life insurance as security during the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , there are only no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , with the corresponding financial - success the payout of the st@@ aking damage had been decided by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one has paid a portion of the correspon@@ dents only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when one plus had been in the account , paying off . &quot;
therefore also breaks - and not details ab@@ rup@@ tions indicated , the former Ob@@ server explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and austerity @-@ books managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
why the payments of the club were not sufficiently publi@@ ci@@ zed or asked the judge in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail in the financial stability , it was important only for the debt of debt , the answer . &quot;
&quot; when as a year of 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros started on the stat@@ ute account , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the bank account . &quot;
&quot; those have been appropri@@ ated , they declared the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second accused , and was not known to the association according to the testimony of the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after that , the Lord was not asking for a long answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if anything had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the pro@@ secutor had put in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ accused was informed he justi@@ fies the function@@ ary .
this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; compensation scheme &quot; .
why dis@@ claims ? and they wanted to know judge and pro@@ secutor .
&quot; after that the first accused , he agreed not to agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what can I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all off the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional , he never obtained a cent of content , he only comp@@ uted o@@ dom@@ eter and diets . &quot;
&quot; on the coaching , he put in charge of the club 1,000 euros per month , the actual effort was however much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants were unable to prove accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; these were made after a running , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer kept , they declared . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second accused .
&quot; all those in cash are made in cash , in addition to which he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard St@@ ranges more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the personnel recruitment for three years , the computer drug is going to build further jobs during the spl@@ itting of the company . &quot;
the inter@@ missions at the US computer @-@ computer He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients . &quot;
&quot; in this way , costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.2 billion euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; HP dealt at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 to approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
w@@ ish@@ ly gave the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share 2.3 % .
&quot; the company &apos;s large @-@ founded group from the Califor@@ ni@@ an Pal@@ o Alto is currently underway , so the computer and print business still h@@ ates into a new society - split from the higher levels with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business divisions should be noted on the stock market .
&quot; another disappointing PC section as well as weaker demand for corporate clients according to its services set up the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer after Len@@ ovo at last , most recently . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers had decreased by 1@@ 1.5 percent in the third quarter of July . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proceeds from 15 out of 16 quarters went back .
HP respond with shut@@ down and massive post@@ ings on the change in the industry .
the 76 years old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted only late that customers are buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and more and more shops get online .
&quot; Whit@@ man restructuring plans will see a total of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : a majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly come across dis@@ agreement : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent showed himself appro@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; while other states will take air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive . &quot;
24 per cent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
&quot; cooperation with the Syrian rulers Bashar al @-@ Assad reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ c@@ ke : violence of the Persian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have imposed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ light against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has witnessed the full force of violence at the border inspection .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
&quot; behind it , a police line had formed and behind the poli@@ c@@ emen stood a water light . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw away the officials with stones , st@@ aves and plastic bottles . &quot;
officials first put an end@@ lessly pepper spray .
after this the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
a lot of tears was bre@@ wed in the direction of the refugees .
so the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little withdrawn .

rates of decision on interest rates for the US denom@@ ination
&quot; the world ob@@ serves as the U.S. denom@@ ination is assembled on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates have been lifted or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were asked by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half were the last week of view that the F@@ ed will do that , now thinks the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on N@@ UL@@ L . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation in which a large central bank may end the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ rupt view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she has warned the markets to set on an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .
death @-@ protective at the Delta State University adopted by ap@@ uses
&quot; after ki@@ cking and the kill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later took his pe@@ ers later on the day , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he could &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted it to happen , &quot; &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi said that he , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot on someone and killed someone . &quot;
he told the staff of the emergency central fact that police officers must send to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I fix my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house , that will not distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police arrived the scene , she found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of him , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I wanted to do so , I could go back . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , he carried over 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he was an eth@@ ane Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when they killed him . &quot;
&quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he know nothing of a conflict between he and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that supposedly believed that Pr@@ en@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ ec@@ ks@@ relation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ en@@ ss was conceived by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married about seven years earlier than a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but my friends were friends . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ en@@ ss have had a daughter who is 19 , and they were destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ en@@ ss got their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ en@@ ss worked online from home , following statement by L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as being a strong friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ en@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , who had been with him for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; the police said he was called &quot; &quot; Rel@@ ated &quot; &quot; at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he was not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when poli@@ cem@@ an him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he drove his car to the side , escaped , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
he received a doctoral title in spring 2015 by the Delta State University ( Doc@@ tr@@ Doc@@ tr@@ ler on the University of the University ) .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa launches the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group of corporations .
&quot; half a billion euros per year wants to save the Lufthansa company alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1,000 senior executives will pay the workplace to the workplace . &quot;
the pilot &apos;s trade union does not exist in the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds up their business structure and values the endor@@ sement Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit fee of some 500 million euros per year from costs and sol@@ vents , the airline distributed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , in the case of the Lufthansa , there will be no more board member for the passenger in the future . &quot;
the Billi@@ g@@ gling smooth@@ ie is designed as independent as possible for this .
&quot; in the board team at boss Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , in future Karl Ulrich Sh@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future . &quot;
&quot; in the re@@ vocation , Spo@@ hr underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
the airline &apos;s bank@@ note under the passage of the Air@@ line Group taking three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot association cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court strikes on this Thursday .
this shared the union with them .
the theme of the talks should be the resting arrangements for pilots .
&quot; cock@@ pit wool in one year with an projected record result &quot; &quot; as soon as possible to viable results . &quot;
the conflict between the unions and Air@@ line in recent months led to various strikes .
&quot; background is the &quot; &quot; austerity &quot; &quot; apart from the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot;
it looks ahead that the Lufthansa in the battle against competitor has lag@@ ging in Euro@@ wings .
&quot; under the title &quot; &quot; Morgen@@ stern to the South &quot; &quot; are paintings of Le@@ ena cur@@ ger in the avant @-@ garde to see . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play Mon@@ el@@ ang because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , a double frac@@ ture in his right bank . &quot;
&quot; while this produced the left outer defense against crying and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by an in@@ consider@@ ate attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w had fallen in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before he was killed in the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bull and is located in the hospital . &quot;
it will be published tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operate in Manchester .
&quot; it is terri@@ fying - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask on .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape to a Red Card and the im@@ position of a mo@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al affir@@ med that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
&quot; for yourself , you can judge for yourself if I say that a h@@ ue and a red card was due . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et to Sha@@ ws account saved : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
&quot; corresponding to the Manchester United , the loss of Luke Sha@@ w is suffering with the defeat of the PS@@ V &quot;
the England defen@@ ders has an added incentive in France with the European Championship in France to recover up to the coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves with this kind of injury the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt another opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg outbreak in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you listen then that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard to be such a thing . &quot;
I feel very bad . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was also transferred to the hospital - after a f@@ ou@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; surely , David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ? &quot;
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it nearly am@@ agile . &quot;
&quot; unless they are David Cameron , they may be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he has been asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was decided , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book I &apos;d like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or message that we have previously missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron presented the action of the book , instead , returns a summary of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of his dreams , whose proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ el lu@@ cked and the 1991 died , however completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this has not been suspected enough , the text presented by Cameron is like the summary of the &quot; &quot; Lor@@ ax film &quot; &quot; which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely Cameron wants the act of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the long @-@ known Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , schn@@ ur@@ ous beings who speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax to a child 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come by Cameron &apos;s election office .
&quot; super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Camer@@ ons employees was delivered , but there were no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from the UK , but it is still tough . &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but considering the Ka@@ der , the UK has selected for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series , not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Ab@@ el@@ air C@@ ause page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive approach . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size on test level is an option for the attack . &quot;
result @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th fet@@ ched from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision , Adam Ly@@ th will , of course , be hard for me as his manager in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are oriented towards results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , when he hits further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes out . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not deliver good achievements , and he surprised me not : he is above all a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question of how much time a test head@@ man receives , to put his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; there were seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son , in front of him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton 9 got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England was first Jonathan in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in peak form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a dr@@ one I appreciate very much . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ er , which we saw from Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends of course on the team assignment in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave the lakes next to Cook , which would yield an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ x@@ ies , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a dr@@ one could not strike there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious dor@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but it is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger , played its first 38 tests on the first drop before joining in 2001 as an Open@@ er . &quot;
he immediately made hundreds of us immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner and in my limited time dealing with him he was very impressed by me as a young man .
&quot; people possibly watch their statistics on - an average of 31 with the ball and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of back@@ ups that have lifted up their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; aside from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Lu@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nicest candle makers of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience since he has played amongst all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previous songs . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One Day@@ ton , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and Team@@ leaders are not determined by the schedule . &quot;
and you must think that on players depend on their jobs on the results .
such decisions will not be easy to heart .
the Bre@@ xit @-@ camp ( Bre@@ xit = Foreign of Britain &apos;s out of the EU ) could gain an allowance if the economy run up to 2017 in a flu@@ ential device
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ booked re@@ comp@@ action strategy to keep Britain in the EU will end up with every day deeper into difficulties , even without the election of the genius Jer@@ emy &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour and TU@@ C , which had been t@@ acked through Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ate friend said , &quot; &quot; several member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in different crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own fault , Great Britain itself , created an agenda with reported ann@@ ot@@ ings and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they most often do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on the annual meeting that it does not like it , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they allies win for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes for an overseas great Britain within the EU tent , &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - and suggests that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cautious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave ministry , before it looks bad for them as it has been done with the exagger@@ ated long rides like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election and substitution in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ush force .
Poland has soon made a nationalist right government in Spain .
&quot; it is hard to imagine , imag@@ ining that she should get a leg to help the self @-@ British to prevent their energy better , Scotland &apos;s leaving the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might not inten@@ tionally un@@ book any helpful comment , completely in SN@@ P style , during the British referendum in 2017 , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t win anything out of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on their expense and the EU scep@@ tics , the oligarchy of the press bar@@ ons , did not , however , did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists , who has made a name for himself as an &quot; EU t@@ ell@@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ er years . &quot;
&quot; with all his madness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing jack@@ ets , phone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseudo @-@ in@@ lands that have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair was quite similar to her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage allowing you to convey better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ian as Blair , when he turned down the Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Blair had rejected a principle on the un@@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never displaced him that .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on my back on Monday - I said he had no more time to waste myself - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ er years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to gain the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe - I express it very friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ et tendency and the wild sources of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably be any one to say yes .
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but not Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the Radio and on TV this week told not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 years , when his old father tried to be on television therefore , loyal towards his Labour @-@ cabinet , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under any circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ conductors and members following all reports on the Monday night Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching a @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even has stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of Social Media , a breeding @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe who permits him to keep Lab@@ our@@ y support in the campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Don@@ nell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities , in accordance with their Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ial @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities , Tom Wat@@ son is also convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to trying to find a sense of their supervis@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin be wast@@ ing political capital , they are also suspi@@ cious voters - to make the concessions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ? &quot;
&quot; the U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the T@@ ory government to power where British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was called . &quot;
criticism of Public Health England on E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 persons , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) were Lanc@@ et to critici@@ ze that they are critic@@ ised by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and commented on the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial supporting in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month taken the &quot; &quot; extraordinary win@@ dy basis &quot; , &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J , asking if the claims &quot; are built &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are based around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ user decision @-@ decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Trust Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions about the damage caused by various nicotine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the twelve participants at the meeting agreed to receive funding from an E @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but some well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a range of sectors in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco charge took part from p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; confess &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damages of most products at most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the asser@@ tions of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there have hitherto been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been served as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &apos; . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at p@@ he said that has already been responded to the asser@@ tions of BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at its addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes can be small compared to that , but we continue to have long term effects to study . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has given the clear duty to inform the public about what is eviden@@ ced and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people are dying every year on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking is the national health system two billion £ per year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear indication of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ on , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should end , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ als would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK radio stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for them to be public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he has been trying to get into contact with BBC 4 for six years with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sends , which were also clearly displayed from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ IT Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I consider medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , it is supposed to do its production at least on programs that others do not do or put on behalf . &quot;
they are sending The Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future as possible .
&quot; the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous it is natural nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financed programs that could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly both original productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
&quot; I am trying to see , how this should be public @-@ right TV . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business builder for series , who ran the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC might be to blame for reviews &quot; due to the ambitions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure the long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC broadcast shows that again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how the East@@ en@@ ders sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can pretty miss the audience , but they can argue when they pass on their dedicated missions to the justification of 4 billion pounds , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them into a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see . &quot;
&quot; for broad@@ casting fee Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions which can benefit the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , think that there is a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , wonder whether that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday that the BBC asked its Rei@@ ye@@ ian mission to educate and maintain . &quot;
he said : only little from BBC @-@ production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % on the radio - and it should take part in the public @-@ law TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada as an example to clarify and maintain .
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial channels alliances in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Other News &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ t@@ ori@@ des change the direction in the moment they are broad@@ cast@@ ed with Klang@@ impul@@ sen .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; tiny Nem@@ t@@ ato@@ des change the direction right now , in which they connect with Klang@@ impul@@ sen which will have heard for the human hearing on high frequencies to be aired . &quot;
&quot; the impulses are generated by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels , which respond to ultras@@ ound waves . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called son@@ o@@ gram , where ultras@@ ound is used to enable a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which adm@@ its electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; bas@@ tions usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made a feast that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found it out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound @-@ waves that penetrate into wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced aluminum waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 micro@@ channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the ro@@ ot@@ cells .
&quot; the reson@@ ates show the opening of these ion@@ als and activate the cells that they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ den , Chal@@ as@@ ani continued genetically the wor@@ ms so that some of her Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ers TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he applies ultr@@ asonic on the changing creatures , the si@@ eves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ wer and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ c@@ ann@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ graphy , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turn on . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said he could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound waves can be un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make temporary human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , &quot; he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; eleven years ago I moved into a student dormit@@ ory , still with faith in Ber@@ ets and moral relevance , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , mu@@ ddy complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I learned , can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules . &quot;
the one @-@ train in students varies from easy to nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sne@@ ak up : people tell wh@@ ence you come , whether and where you are not love Sab@@ bat@@ os , because in gravity , guys , it &apos;s only a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out people who like you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your lashes were caught in brand and these fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverage recipes , movie night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people put on and their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this context , do not remember to begin at the university with a relationship . &quot;
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ tes receive a gro@@ ove treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many students lives up a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone who tries to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going on , but you must go away , so that I may get the energy back I used for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a class@@ mates is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it an SMS , instead of knock . &quot;
speaking of ank@@ ice : do it .
a guy in my student dwell@@ ings had the idea that a non @-@ gone door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
make friends through b@@ aking .
&quot; as you begin the university at the height of the back Man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of browsers , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to bake , so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
&quot; home made goodies , is a good way to make friend@@ ships . &quot;
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to entertain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad ming@@ ling pumps from flour , sugar and gre@@ ase also lead you to sleep sle@@ ep@@ y when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is theft , but is it a drop of a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the owner @-@ owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they bo@@ il in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if any person ste@@ al your stuff , is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate share a flush , to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise from the people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that you in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something extra , drum &amp; bass little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to it with still loud music .
&quot; when she ended up at 5 p.m. , she let her neighbors kindly ask for two hours before they left their own music , closed her door and set off to her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic when your future spouse would move random@@ ly into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely it would not be deeply awk@@ ward if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage arrangements , to dis@@ connect them again and then see them each day and perhaps along with how to bring all our common friends to yourself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but when a hot @-@ room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partnership , try at least to talk a little reason at least . &quot;
&quot; in the upright moment , in which you notice that somebody has his keys in his un@@ occupied room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bullying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stretch is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water which you can then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions at the ceiling is no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ ear@@ chers , Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds new@@ ly@@ ric terrac@@ ed houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; thus for refugees - but also as a signal &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I show how to continue to build good and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the residential market .
the entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner : a lot of refugees will push for the residential market .
what solution can you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass housing in containers or Turn@@ h@@ halls has no sustainability .
because human beings remain a great part here .
&quot; in the face of the refugee flow , we need enough space in the coming decades . &quot;
one very ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terrac@@ ed house needs the least square .
it facilitates the integration .
it is different if people under@@ pin the people in motorhome blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be changed according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house consists of 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is over@@ man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months to construction .
this is appropriate .
did the construction rules make their plans complic@@ it ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I still dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the risk of ho@@ ur@@ ring special construction and the pitches @-@ box .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ stated , who creates three apartments in a terrac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants re@@ acted to their town@@ house ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those , they threw me , new super@@ s for asylum seekers . &quot;
what definitely is not right .
but tigh@@ ten you not tigh@@ tening the op@@ el to compens@@ ate apartments ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true yet : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments in the past five years . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; to enter &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software @-@ Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have been found after installing problems , as they get a error message , that communic@@ ates that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the issue , users are advised to either wait until the amount goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to prescri@@ bing the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth ensuring that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is in the vicinity of a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might devi@@ ate from half @-@ way and this could result in a demo@@ lition of the updates . &quot;

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum B@@ ha@@ ft have joined the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Earl @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
&quot; aside from consultation , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation takes it down from the mountain into the city center .
exactly said to the Count St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
here a new roof firm has recently opened .
&quot; here , immediately adjacent to the shopping market , you will receive seniors and rates for information on questions such as care insurance or on health benefits and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years we have been proof with our out@@ patient nursing service , that often nursing staff can be left alone . &quot;
there are endless many questions here .
&quot; neither too many achievements of the masses will not be used because the complexity of the insurance companies is not yet understood , explained the new house@@ holders in Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Civil War , as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; beside the consultation , the new qu@@ arti@@ ship office offers also prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
in this case the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
&quot; therefore you can use additional offers such as storm @-@ prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the services of the Re@@ ti@@ cian centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis live in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , pensions and re@@ hab . &quot;

&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) , at the inauguration ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ fic@@ s also dedic@@ ate himself to the association &apos;s camp : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able resident . &quot;
&quot; with this , the social foundation reduced a large contribution that the elderly can live as independently and well in their trusted environment . &quot;

men Check in 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses asked the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ ins : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from bad so@@ cks in the direction of Sal@@ ch@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was at the height of the B@@ FT @-@ gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , and struck his face on this with their own . &quot;
the victim caused a nose @-@ legged and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sted and imp@@ acting on the bat , he initially left him from his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the wron@@ g@@ do@@ er followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove past several times .
&quot; when you no longer see the vehicle , the last one was going to smoke in front of the building in order to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; there he was once again attacked by the bat , and another male person . &quot;
under the helpl@@ ess of a head@@ stick to the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim &apos;s body .
the last one had to be put into hospital for medical treatment .
so far only a v@@ ague project description is available .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters large .
the second bat is about 1.@@ 65 metres in size and was cloth@@ ed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white dress .

Dr. Frank Müller taking over the field of Fel@@ gle@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gle@@ ausen .
&quot; in addition , there are also Sam@@ t@@ collabor@@ ator Bernd Bor@@ mann , business distribution in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller appointed the practice of Fel@@ gle@@ ausen on the 1st of October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gle@@ ausen noted in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in his successor during the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a construction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises on the St.@@ George Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who at present completed their vocational educational background in the dener hospital and who also wants to get into practice as well . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gle@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; when it was concerned , I was simply called it . &quot;
&quot; the couple of Müller liked the idea , in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf , to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact to patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he may also be able to be his own boss soon . &quot;
&quot; and so , the Mü@@ llers was bought the house with the practice . &quot;
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grown up , his medicine studies at Hannover followed in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; at present he is active as a primary atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , in addition he was appointed assistant &apos;s ambul@@ ance in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ wood and is honorary and un@@ paid in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gle@@ ausen as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian , his spouse has been specialized in the g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both inter@@ vie@@ wings , want to be crus@@ hed as house@@ keeper . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will look modern .
we are offering more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and tough@@ en @-@ EK@@ GS .
&quot; moreover , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
a total of 50@@ 000 Euro obtained the Mü@@ llers in the framework of a sponsor@@ ing program of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ ach@@ er@@ ner Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice Fel@@ gle@@ ausen , in the North @-@ German average practice , they are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is yet another general practitioner .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gle@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , she would have gone . &quot;
who visits the Mü@@ llers lesson and continue to look in familiar faces at the same time : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field training .
&quot; with their say goodbye in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors spent thirty years practiced there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gle@@ ausen changed . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will still often see , &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ nis@@ ts . &quot;
your husband is adding l@@ ach@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed for gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grandchildren and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls are also up@@ lifted to our border @-@ border , &quot; said Interior with Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; how it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application , this can also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the provision and safety of the people is always in the foreground .
&quot; sure , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flow , not beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia certified &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia itself
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia &apos;s plans to continue to travel to Austria and Germany and may also be built cor@@ ridors for refugees .
in this way the Interior in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach is not .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely inakzeptabel , &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - to intensify . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister of Foreign Minister , Slovenia wants to ensure its borders to refugees but not to visit . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government rus@@ hed , the first refugees had already tried to pass in the night hours on Tuesday to depart from Eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to so@@ ak the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick her up in the nearby villages .
&quot; according to local media , the police and new refugees have been meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and have participated in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly concerned about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
also b@@ ail@@ out services and the Red Cross have already been in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country reck@@ on with around 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; the buses from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border so far , helped Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade too , however , that she may be able to embrace certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b border city of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the in@@ mates were travelling all night away from the border , about 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border in Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary made , so the police said to us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually now lead to an observer shift in the recent EU route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west track .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stresses that his country for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees had prepared appropriate plans for possible compensation .
&quot; details he not , he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; has comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
one lead strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since introduced a positive witness to the country &apos;s standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on this side , behind the Hungarian border fence still stuck about 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media report , they would have spent the last night at the boundary of horror that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing ov@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Steph@@ ano@@ vic tried to put it at an early stage in Hor@@ gos : he maintains the debates on Altern@@ ativ@@ ep@@ ines of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not currently be a very high refugee price .
they can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers and migrants too - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to spread to the refugees , on which alternative routes caused by Croatia are shown . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , even more spacious min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police have announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ers were sent in the border region .
stock h@@ ackers : Ukrainian people pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which has been thrown out since 2010 , repeatedly get insight into un@@ released financial statements and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
with the exploited information they should have done in@@ sider transactions on the financial markets .
thus in a total of more than 100 million dollars were recorded .
&quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside our country @-@ borders are ultimately captured &quot; , &quot; it is stated in the S@@ EC communication . &quot;
the processes against 32 further sign@@ alled in the case failed .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are accused of acting both in the USA and Eastern Europe .

&quot; again and again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions on the action itself , about life , dealing with the dying . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear that for me at some point the end on this world comes , I can become responsible , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ united bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ asia . &quot;
therefore be this public for effective action of 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; that not everyone wants to communicate to the boards of the tables , be understandable , ultimately it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jose@@ fine lam@@ mer , albeit at the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open up . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant sen@@ ded his winn@@ ings on a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ transport service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to present about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to adapt the seasonal seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share went over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than for earlier pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which will be aver@@ aged 4.@@ 9 percent and in the 4th of January , and despite higher access to bo@@ d@@ ants of heavy and large packages , which will be as@@ certain@@ ed from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expect the result to increase the earnings before the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO of Fred Smith said that the company educ@@ ates &quot; solid income , &quot; if you consider the weaker than anticipated economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holidays employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , which plans to set up 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million is worth $ 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the result per share was amoun@@ ted to $ 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of C@@ acks Investment Research questioned analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
6 of Z@@ acks asked analy@@ st expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international primary shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales climbed by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was mainly flat because of higher cost of larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher earnings based on higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 billion , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed a total of 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent on a record high@@ s 11th June . &quot;
&quot; at their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days a week round about a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ a table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; on them at one end of the closed , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat sa@@ wing , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the congress : maximize the US occupation and prices shown here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a failed third party ; financial stability .
&quot; this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be w@@ ro@@ aring through the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent Tur@@ moil in the global financial markets render the already cautious tor@@ ment representatives to increase these volati@@ lity by increasing interest rates for federal government - and be it only about one quarter of percent@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase the interest rate , the increased insecurity about the global market enough justification , continued to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which secur@@ es itself into the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were asked recently from Bloomberg , have predicted that same week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait the F@@ ed with a key indication that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists merge the blow , it promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Equipment j@@ umped around 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or about 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy pers@@ ists the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief Executive at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she had to go very far in her statement to re@@ assure the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a financial increase would all@@ assure the financial markets , because they would do the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the mon@@ et@@ ting conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring , and in the early summer , despite the complaints of the liber@@ als that would require more economic advance , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank to 5.2 % over the past month , the lowest since more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level that the F@@ ed considers full employment . &quot;
wages have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although the inflation continued to run under the financial goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main obstacle is the temporary impact of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist with the Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world were committed together at the end of the last month , after China had been valued its currency . &quot;
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage coinci@@ ded in May by more than 16 % among its top than investors anticipated that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would cr@@ ush global growth .
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , whereby the Dow is now situated just 10 % below the high of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market spaces influence the complex calculation of the complex calculation when you want to increase the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese business in the last few weeks did not occurred , Mr D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot;
&quot; now , he predicted that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what effects will be on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the capitals of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world .
the influence of the central bank had been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed might be able to restrict their Mongo@@ lian expansion &quot; &quot; narrow , &quot; &quot; con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly linked with one another , they can only monitor the development of others , but also consult with other central banks and experts to ensure better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ el , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , marked this month , that &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to finance market movements , which with apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ alist data . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , atmospheric member of the Federal Open Market Committee , aimed at a inser@@ tion , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives did und@@ o those cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put forward aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the re@@ unification of 2008 , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent Tur@@ moil do not come close to this level , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to enter into the situation in which they are afraid of a fence , because the markets are erect , &quot; &quot; - Poznań , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act keeps the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it &apos;s the time ahead . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ mer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , does not go without the dedication of a volunteer volunteer . &quot;

Brazilian society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to explain in shocking ways women how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted on br@@ ist@@ les who are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that give babies every nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ac@@ al adjustment to bring the mother@@ boards . &quot;
&quot; a recent study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet can actually affect the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative influence on the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Al@@ ent@@ at Bern@@ ried authorized the contract for the 2.3 million Euros of the sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to flat for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ seeing turn@@ around at Bern@@ rie@@ fing sports centre come step by step : in the recent e @-@ council meeting the working @-@ application was un@@ communicated with no great discussion .
&quot; previously , the panel had decided on a statutory &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan , among other things . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form of the attic . &quot;
&quot; according to the results , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ established first and roof pillars should be established . &quot;
&quot; background of planning is the intended use of the roof for solar generators : &quot; &quot; this is why we get a wonderfully large southern part , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; when &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , it was on the roof level that is required for energy reasons - different from the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan on the roof a@@ version no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der common der@@ at usually proceeds even more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , when it is rever@@ ber@@ ation , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the athle@@ tic building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at cost , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
supplements are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
&quot; in the next step of the process , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall will now be presented to the Land@@ mark Office . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; early as planned , the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed sooner than planned - namely 2016 . &quot;
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees are moved by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg through to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seen the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , affir@@ med , affir@@ med by the Kar@@ itor of Andrea Josi@@ chner and White . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board will adopt a decision on this , however , and the down@@ stairs to the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees work on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority can move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a work in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Chief of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , and is now moving to a private office in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to take up the succession , came according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who declared to take over the management from October 1 , and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au state this in each case a &quot; &quot; sof@@ tening &quot; &quot; and distribution of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; such as jo@@ wer @-@ white . &quot;
fisher@@ man is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ aker and De@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inner station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; col@@ lo@@ qui@@ ally for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board gives consent to our team , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ itt@@ l@@ ant , which still has 35 beds to finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County has planned this for 2018 , as the currently running re@@ clamation at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ wer @-@ White , the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , who also meet Chairman of the Supervisory Board , argued that the house , which is owned by the Federal President , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the end I close . as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say there are several reflections . &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ time care of the car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; what did not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come back , &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ Moving to the Le@@ ch which was taken by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where fishermen has been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years , I have not given it . &quot;
he was asked to be asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in recent decades by closing , and has been closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

&quot; during the Aber@@ deen on a ma@@ el@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( county of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters have been in action , like the police rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ 66 and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , it was unclear . &quot;

a crime show has led the police on the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the case of the twenty @-@ year old , the young people were killed and their body was thrown into a canal in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a non @-@ violent attack to the victim .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , such as pro@@ secutor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , a recorded 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also valid at the duty of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who report@@ edly increased the specification and the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday mor@@ nings after they did not arrive at home on the eve of a autumn visit in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the evening .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ator first appeared to personal belon@@ gings of the victim .
&quot; in questionn@@ aires in the circle and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the se@@ mis@@ ts , finally a crime came up against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the mut@@ in@@ arily perpetr@@ ator caused the police to lead to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;

&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be fought on Wednesday the o@@ e@@ pl@@ ers , the investig@@ ators lay him full blow to the burden . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study warned against housing .
the situation on the German housing market is stra@@ ined .
more and more refugees are seeking to be paid .
pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the departments on the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; with the coming refugees and searching people from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot;
it will compete with a low @-@ weak citizens for the last paid apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for paid apartments , up to 2020 each year would have to be 400@@ ,000 new units . &quot;
&quot; this result is a study commissioned by the association of &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be ready in Germany . &quot;
&quot; hence the missing 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across to the apartment market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Bundes@@ amt , in last year , less than half of all asylum seekers lived to rent . &quot;
the negative development of the housing market is not just due to the growing refugee population .
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany turns into a housing deficit one year ago that is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; at present , in the metropolitan areas , some 77@@ ,000 units were already compl@@ ained , with Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals were held at the capital of capitals in capital @-@ room@@ ed in WG rooms .
&quot; young adults stayed in@@ voluntarily on the apartment market because of the flu@@ ff on the apartment market , no longer in the &quot; &quot; hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meter per capita in recent years has fallen back again . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance of &quot; social housing construction &quot; suggests a new start . &quot;
this should boost new incentives for social housing again .
this could be wai@@ ved on the underlying income tax and will be suspended the base tax for funded apartments .
&quot; in addition , Alliance &apos;s attractive tax exemp@@ tion is necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W is now well located in towns and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start of the year , with 18@@ 4 million Euros , more than half of the available some 300 million euros have been found . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be bu@@ sted . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia direct corridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no coming through it , as more and more refugees pick up the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces who leave transit of Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is still dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrived to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reports the Croatian remote station r@@ st station .
Hungary had its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , do virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia does not want to let refugees happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something . &quot;
yet people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had captured the first refugees on the border of Serbia at the border of Serbia in Croatia .
&quot; most of the media are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with Ta@@ xen in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after her arrival , she would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; against the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come to f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the border calls to other dangers . there are still sharp min@@ ers from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should quickly create a safe passage .
after Hung@@ arians close to the closure of the border there are barely any refugees .
on Tuesday the police demanded 3@@ 66 bre@@ wed people .
shortly before the p on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws constitute the overthrow and damage of the border with us as offen@@ se .
&quot; in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced . &quot;
this deportation pen@@ alties of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , one spent on Tuesday in the newly appointed &quot; Tran@@ min@@ ons &quot; on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - most important transition of R@@ ös@@ s . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , there are 13 families with young children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning they would have spent 40 refugees .
&quot; however , there is practically no prospect of getting in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the diso@@ wned asylum seekers should be de@@ ported .
&quot; before the &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , there were only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to turn off .
&quot; they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , which tens of thousands of people over the past weeks left at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ y@@ wall units have been disman@@ tled and one of the re@@ plac@@ ements in the bor@@ dering has been modified .
&quot; to the goal of this transformation , no one wanted to speak . &quot;
Austria reaches the border of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants stopped in government to government , but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the German authorities .
in liberty there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor went &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the borders
&quot; we were busy after the bridge @-@ festival on Sunday with the set up , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel off@@ ender at the entrance of the tent , &quot; W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alois Town . &quot;
tourists were determined by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly for Germany because of the refugee flow to Austria because of the refugee flow to Austria , he was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; the city who immediately offered his help and reached the trail along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the river N@@ ahe river traffic . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had the un@@ hoped @-@ hoped @-@ for guests only once , with break and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said immediately , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; as a meeting in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it take , delivered a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire bri@@ ga@@ des . &quot;
&quot; this has been very happy , &quot; says Urban . &quot;
&quot; the gained train passengers were asc@@ ended on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE in a regional train to Pass@@ au , to the short notice that the train traffic was stopped to Germany , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
the regional train was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing generally is high in the course .
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , sund@@ ays the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends now further tens of thousands of us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right at the establishment of structures , ensure human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has moved to the Hungarian Government in the ar@@ eg@@ inity of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; even those politics are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now faced with chaotic states now . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ oul@@ try will have to find out that the &quot; held country , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp is . &quot;
&quot; there will be a major challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the near winter to produce decent conditions for protective seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

&quot; finally , the chaos in the first trial centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been made under control . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; said Con@@ rad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry however spoke of a &quot; &quot; fragile situation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Con@@ rad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ian year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , must be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 , the countries are supposed to provide € 15,000 in the Bund . &quot;
&quot; if it is more refugees , we can manage it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; she said . &quot;
with the governor he has already had talks .
&quot; they would have saved him , and also for the coming refugees to be squee@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Con@@ rad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be classified as the church will help .
great expectation also places the asylum coordinator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot;
on the platform individuals can provide uncomplicated accommodations .
&quot; in addition , you hopes to get empty at hotels that will be empty during winter . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation as a &quot; &quot; very high &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must respect a certain amount of the hand@@ box or size of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in order to have a fixed time , &quot; &quot; need to apply &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he was more successful in contrast to the Ministry of Interior concerning accommodation , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am a older gentleman , who is not telling the fal@@ se@@ hood without any other face . &quot;
persu@@ asive power is its most important weapon .
&quot; Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic , as they said . &quot;
your number of employees want to increase them from three to four .
the own source loc@@ alization was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in an office .
yet there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz is calling for better division
&quot; not until the opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips , arena and Design Center for providing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary , since the persons affected currently cannot place these measures at this time , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; but for emergen@@ cies , further locations are to be checked for their mobility . &quot;
the chief state of the government on the distribution of refugees among the federal states .
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) state governor Josef P@@ ag@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further action in the refugee query .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ass@@ ures me that German borders are not sealed off .
the continuing transit of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
special suits with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the protected searching would however be brought with regular trains to Germany .
&quot; by the other EU member states , ag@@ it@@ ating once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee crisis . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria once again carries out controls on its borders , is a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans for &quot; &quot; stir@@ er@@ ers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a Question of Time
the reconstruction of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office building and production building , the running IT @-@ group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
it can imagine to invest in start @-@ up firms in the new ship@@ yard and later identify which to acquire .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T want to cooperate with the new neighbors - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; T were invested by S &amp; T into the site , 3,@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is adapted by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meter of resi@@ dual space in the building are rented for rent , for another 40 percent give it inquiries . &quot;

larger bags and accessories for up to 500 euros .
from yesterday the new shop is in operation .
it has been rebuilt several weeks earlier .
&quot; but I have long over@@ lay down if I was to open a shop , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site , on which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Region Linz to sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has broad gained from her mother in the cradle .
&quot; at most , when something develops and I can show new trends too high @-@ performance prices . &quot;
why so some women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag is in duty and the professional lady can not be answered with the latest safety .
perhaps it is possible that a beautiful p@@ ou@@ ch has been upgraded to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ gi@@ ver . &quot;
this feature also connects the billi@@ on@@ aire to be the billi@@ on@@ aire to become the US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always very good for jewellery .
whether he is manifested to xen@@ opho@@ bic ( journalists ) or in gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate of the US presidential office wage the electoral campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well thereby .
&quot; this is also registered in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the property milli@@ metre comes from . &quot;
the New Yor@@ kers with the com@@ promis@@ sory review is a term on many in the vin@@ t@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him about -@@ ei@@ r sites .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ ine Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; what do the villagers think about his goal , become the most powerful man in the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think they &apos;re somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters are not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ contractor has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous Spr@@ ös@@ s where apart from Tr@@ ump will also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to say - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the heart , he has not put it there . &quot;
&quot; although there are respect for the performance of the family , but also bi@@ ased the opinion that Tr@@ ump ... would be a bit a pair of loud@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; pl@@ ast@@ ed the nickname , the k@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - on high German : the owners , she says . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emigr@@ ated and opened a restaurant for the min@@ er in the USA . &quot;
cornerstone of the property company was the first property purchases in New York .
&quot; the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy : her wish , to return to the country for a long time , was sh@@ ado@@ wed by the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was then belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump as he was once without permission , the director of the Institute of P@@ äl@@ z@@ isches History and Folklore , Roland Paul , wrote to the film start . &quot;
l@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally dot@@ ted statements of the follow @-@ up .
&quot; he had repeatedly discussed due to Mexican immigrants in the United States and claimed the construction of a barrier , to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as being the pol@@ ishing , that is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , an removed relative of m@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was borrowed &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always like a thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never attended K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ we@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm was mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz visited something for the church organ , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; this can not imagine myself by the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they hold it better if he did not know the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical outlook , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been in the USA at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been as he would , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more exciting themes than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ilers Sarah Dance . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president . &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Ferrari to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently wit@@ ted father , which joins in New Zealand with two children , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could win a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit the Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 until 17.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new Quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe burned an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the Monday evening , the first half hour was recorded by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decrease in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be hope@@ ful that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually compete at 17 : 30 . &quot;

&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have become unk@@ now@@ ingly obvious , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman , at which Sam Wood landed at The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped in greatest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award ; if it is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two are checked , you might have accidentally a clue about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the finals on Thursday sealed .
&quot; all three women have reli@@ ed themselves in a ly@@ ric manner that wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to receive the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the gam@@ spo@@ ber who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki , both quickly - except for himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies were re@@ marked , since I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I have thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week you made it clear that wood &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked what wood should choose , when not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle were great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams sent after his impressive open training session at the end of last year &apos;s requests .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coach could have played Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a scr@@ am@@ ble as the Aussie Millions Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League @-@ conver@@ ged on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave us the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; rather than pushing his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also made public in its press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ ad Cam , one told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who loves to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne has been bu@@ cking at a pun@@ t , restored in the first game quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian at@@ tainment for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ on left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a bad start in his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ward made the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al zone led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .

&quot; free voters request for the high refugee population , the hi@@ ring of a thousand new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in front of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn , for the many new students , there is no need for new teachers : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get ent@@ ations in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ rush of the Free voters has been to the commune of the Spanish commune .
&quot; actually , most other main topics were provided . &quot;
but the record number of refugees also dominates the free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic for asylum is going to over@@ lap the cl@@ aws , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN prot@@ ector for refugees in Syria such as it gave during the Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters out as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative purposes who are responsible for asylum . &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum @-@ ers &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several states were not consistently justi@@ fiable : &quot; &quot; we were engaged in national standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there we have to become more competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy should not fall under the table in the big winding town . &quot;
a years of continuous growth remains on the agenda : the policy of the picture .

but that is not far enough .
&quot; the theme for G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
&quot; we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ as@@ ers , who do this . &quot;
free drive at the G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .

4 people killed after poli@@ cem@@ an rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal shoot
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd , demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out at the Tuesday evening in the R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , around 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ phy , Le@@ ading District officials said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside of a police station , producing some of you stones and br@@ anding . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ phy said the police took Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot up into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the applied rubber bul@@ lets , known by which it can indeed kill , which traditionally used as less deadly alternative , seems to be such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ als Southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ams say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ ines who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent struggles since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed as the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed by centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution was on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislation voted this week on certain cl@@ auses on the draft law in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the neighborhood at the Em@@ my youth Centre Alte Post should be built again .
this city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; construction is a mix of trade , commercial and living , but there is not yet another special offer . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den has to market some 4,000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; you wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor I request is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were closed . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner Great street , already bought a few months ago and can tear them down to it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the hosp@@ it@@ es@@ settlement of the Small Sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor gave first public plans for the project .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further disturbing - they fear the res@@ ale of its leisure time .
&quot; Mon@@ el@@ ang had been closed and made behind closed doors , sal@@ uted , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
the plans for a new holiday stay at the Little Sea are close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ mer@@ it &apos; System construction &apos; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night in the municipal committee &apos;s municipal committee . &quot;
originally this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the framework of the project and the F@@ DP parliamentary group that threw the investor @-@ building management into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet had an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; but it is good , to be able to encounter all the rum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; for months , this project has been active in the discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; fierce reactions from the sea @-@ owners , who had come into the meeting , called the pictures and new details about the desired hotel structure . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and advance member in the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ained , &quot; &quot; This is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that overlooks all the other commands . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he also feared a number of other project critics that the traffic could rise due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; whole crew orders have to come , so that it counts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are of the former restaurant , however is still open . &quot;
still there is no operator .
&quot; only then must we have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts double @-@ double donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling candidate , which aims to help over 11 million $ for humanitarian organisations that have passed the thousands of refugees , as they passed down from war to impover@@ ished and impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of letting one manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who has escaped with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and anxiety . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis have grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations will go to four charitable organisations who provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global donations made donations amoun@@ ted to a value of 5.5 million on vis@@ .com / pun@@ ched in 11 million $ .

report of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for a very overweight di@@ tics it can be helpful weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin So@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial supporting the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
obesity have proven obesity in treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient but most studies have been carried out at people who are disease @-@ fat @-@ obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that somebody is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have been in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obesity and gast@@ ric cancer and gast@@ ric cancer for type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who subjected to this surgery , sun@@ k from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately at the same at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , they dissolved in 36 % of the diabetes condition completely and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is usually only at one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were obtained with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ ro@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
Hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent write the researchers .
&quot; after surgery , the average membrane sank in A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you are reflected in improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in as@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , such as the researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also tested average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ frac@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and recorded a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subject to fat @-@ suffering people , subjected to a obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without raised risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors are going to start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I am reminded that once they have collected these genetic changes , that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love plays at the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is currently taking place in the fiction of fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ predictable , meets years of the flock of her youth , and he fell in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently released Roman &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
beyond the love story the novel may be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because it plays in Lang@@ u@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is happy that she was able to place a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot host all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East could lie . &quot;
the Indo @-@ Buddhist guide asked to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford &quot;
he asked that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity ought to be faced with the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries has indeed admir@@ ably , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s efforts in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; worrying about several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long term solutions like a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
ultimately we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force never has these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and realized that the US &apos;s violent response took a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 I expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence one , and that has imp@@ eded consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quadru@@ ple increase of de@@ pot inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison@@ ing centres across the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low more than Georgia po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of handic@@ ra@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants among children less than 12 years , the toxicity control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink that while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation with the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink about a budget experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash produce to get a tougher drink .
younger children can be instruc@@ ted from attractive ar@@ omas of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( Hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are car@@ n@@ ated .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange showers , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
hill@@ sides inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can lead a few sy@@ ringe to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison Centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let a sip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children get out of it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year girl , recently taken four sp@@ lash of a straw@@ berry smell to the de@@ pot at school , was brought into an emergency to treatment . &quot;
&quot; their blood sugar concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is drunk at an adult law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the ER .
&quot; doctors were monitoring them over night in a separate childhood hospital at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and stum@@ bled across the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ators to store and hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer beyond the reach of the child .
over alcohol poison@@ ing there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario women after the canyon of de@@ pot , which included a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl@@ co@@ hol , who was noted as active ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state New York , whose &quot; &quot; painted &quot; &quot; teacher po@@ is@@ oned to poison@@ ing their &quot; &quot; bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; it announces a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to de@@ pot dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them from their space .
the police regarded the missed Plan as &quot; Ges@@ olo@@ tz &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school@@ ing authority .

the lack of theme competition in the Scottish soccer acade@@ my - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ ang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er told that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic . there are no titles called rival@@ ry with the R@@ ang@@ ers .
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently a messenger for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ ang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ ang@@ ers .
you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will turn things around , un@@ disturbed mu@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss swing to turn things . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League the defeat directed against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points of lead to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we do this like that - but we need to go on .
&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
getting up together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it is in the UK altogether .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period May to July at 16@@ 4.000 , while the number of people working out for the UK as a whole in the same period around 10,000 million climbed . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 percent above the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent as shown in the figures for National statistics ( ONS ) .

why I will be a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except during a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I &apos;ll be sitting in a Viewer Galerie in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is ex@@ uted by the poison@@ ous spra@@ yer . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was performed for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may be able to see signs in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , finding a flawless lottery , to decide which is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is chosen will be watching it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit close by Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we laugh many times when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be permitted to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the de@@ tain@@ ees as he wants , and you will get access . &quot;
I describe me with her .
&quot; they show that they could &quot; &quot; it could have been better artic@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ a had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write down there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public affairs will help the movement against death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts , which I have done . &quot;
I will not go back to all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can apply for them .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it means to see a man an unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; Con@@ stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making its Uni@@ form wet , therefore he turned a depend@@ able tactic - &quot; A good poli@@ cem@@ an is negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Sergei Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
Master @-@ soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins went to his car in the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control , and tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon . &quot;
Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards trying to pick him out and threatens to end the racing sport
Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria did try to install a sp@@ y in his pe@@ ars in the past year and im@@ it@@ ated to end the race immediately .
he took over the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ated Division of Racing Victoria and suggested that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day @-@ day treatment in the last straw on Wednesday .
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and having found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt plate of Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying pro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating a long time , but sometimes you are frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it goes far .
&quot; sometimes you have to react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk about this head , and I want my owners think I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; Moo@@ dy had made the bomb &apos;s bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ated division had tried to pi@@ ate its shed . &quot;
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him a job in my stables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly be ens@@ hr@@ ined to their n@@ oses , because they have failed to touch with me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , official CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ unders , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I think this is personally ?
&quot; did the R@@ V@@ L celebrate , and perhaps makes people responsible outside the trainers , responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying to them now . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; I will put pressure on them , and push them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainers levels of the trainer have established itself with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching did so that he could throw out his license about the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ formed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , awarded the &quot; Mon@@ days &quot; treatment rule &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse@@ power . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has irrit@@ ated mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been such a day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an inquiry into this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
men who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man cur@@ sed to the cur@@ sed tax
on the weekend the police took a man for a collision with a cycl@@ ist and then cur@@ sed driver &apos;s cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was hit with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after having met a car on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley tour from a car on Saturday morning .
&quot; the police said , the driver drove further , without stopping , to help the injured rider . &quot;
on Monday 50 years old man from Nath@@ alia took the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with cur@@ sed and lower aid and also charged because of other traffic controllers .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man of Cob@@ ram stays in hospital . it is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y proposes to fight against rival for claims to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y has submitted criticism to the flag@@ ing of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ er of the Storm players &quot; ring fight &quot; with his team allowed during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a little disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two out of Queensland do not &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ er@@ lim@@ g of his team and told they are focused on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team give him confidence , because it state that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that appears again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring@@ tone than they have 24 : 2 &quot; , &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing about our defensive system or the techniques . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with T@@ ackl@@ es for a real focus on what the trend is achieved . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny because this happens over and over again to this season .
Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked Ben@@ nett from the &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett was won St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that St. George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a sh@@ utter . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have these kinds of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play them . &quot;
&quot; I have reinforced trust , because they are saying these things because they are a bit worried about us to play . &quot;
six weeks ago she probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are Paul sp@@ ying and don &apos;t give a point of gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we are still going to meet them at a stage . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team is free to receive this weekend since they have won the right , either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts from next service tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200.000 $ deposit to drug an@@ kl@@ age
&quot; a man who may pose a life @-@ long punishment because of his temp@@ ting to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were mu@@ cked to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in aug@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the late afternoon and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ing the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café has been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Ser@@ agan , was concerned about the threat of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
he has taken the police at his residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 Dollars as a safety deposit , in order to reach its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the fra@@ grant statements made by the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to hold him away , not to appear , but he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he with@@ holds its Australian and its Ser@@ b Pass at the police and holds a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : guide vendors apart
during a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening a truck driver has been wounded .
two of the three trucks presented a permanent residence in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain , to do@@ dge in the last moment , like the police rus@@ hed . &quot;
the driver of the accident check @-@ up is completely different .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ t@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , logged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to it by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and aler@@ ted her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analysed the computers that were found at address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research &quot; &quot; used in search of un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
Ho@@ g@@ g then claimed against the officers that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; gave to be a poli@@ cem@@ an in order to intimi@@ date them .
&quot; the prosecution &apos; E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a bre@@ cht , - that it is addic@@ tive to intimi@@ date people . &quot;
&quot; he said that the search on the computer were carried out by him , but he said , unless he wanted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to be a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
he was asked for a conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he is sick in the head when he has he , and said , he would see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was in crying and crying . &quot;
she saw then also the un@@ decent images on the phone and confron@@ ting the accused .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who saw much younger than he . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to publish in@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 , last year , and did not appear before judgment at a hearing held on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; President Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual criminal offen@@ ders , because one could argue that &quot; &quot; no other sexual element &quot; &quot; could be found in his trial . &quot;
sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael ass@@ esses whether the judgment is October until October in order to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was not granted for this event but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other cases .
it was added before the date of the jungle to the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user do@@ dge on small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up in the German @-@ Austrian border away from the large control points .
many tu@@ user were made of fear of discovery and detention of people growing at smaller borders .
&quot; out on the Austrian side , he said a speaker from the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the bor@@ der@@ river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were walking on bridges and storage on the German side .
&quot; there , they are taken into reception by Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ists and passed on to the registration . &quot;
at the Munich airport the main police officers arrived back much more refugees next to the start of the weekend .
&quot; until 8 : 00 , around 700 people are arrived in the state capital city of Bavaria , a narr@@ ator said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of Henry &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
Meteor@@ ologists warn of prey in the southwest of Wednesday @-@ afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , hot sea air enter the country , the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart , Germany . &quot;
&quot; that said , &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; is the pi@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; who was pulled from the Bermuda Islands over the last few days . &quot;
fierce storms and thunder@@ storms are expected particularly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D until Thursday morning , it is also at the Black Forest , on the Sch@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b , and in the Lake seek@@ er with Bo@@ en from 60 to 90 hour kilometers . &quot;
the sun will be shining again on Friday .
the masses are doing it : every two years the car@@ makers show their new innovations at the IA@@ A .
&quot; 2015 is mainly a movement for comp@@ acts , which is currently particularly well sold . &quot;
cars of the comp@@ ac@@ ular class are currently particularly qu@@ eri@@ ed : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 per cent of new appro@@ vals exp@@ elled only in August to this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( readers from 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept , and new super@@ s and luxury cars , this year will be presented a lot of new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest premium for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which is available at de@@ aler@@ ship in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the exhibition . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volumes of the volume , the new A@@ stra model is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is presenting an entry below the biggest competitors VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current A@@ stra cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1 @-@ lit@@ re engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and petrol engine of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 HP to which , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engine . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra is first just as five @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be recorded next to A@@ stra at the IA@@ A to new comp@@ acts ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault introduces the fourth generation of its A@@ stra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e exclusively as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically annual GT @-@ version can be seen .
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he also comes as a comb@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Infin@@ iti : really new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in this process , the compact Infin@@ iti works with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also an diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter tower @-@ bom@@ bed and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is to 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely re@@ done is the comp@@ acts model DS 4 , which is at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ re laid hand in front of all hand on the front door : here the cooler model was drawn , and the changed spot@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , above all the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reduces the number of buttons via touch@@ screen and integrated by Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; added to the IA@@ A in the compact class , it is a series of over@@ laps and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell is deserted
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former prisoner of the judicial pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was given for months in one to small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of their human dignity , in@@ mates are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot;
this decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for the judges even if they were locked only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner , with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was housed in a separate chamber of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single branch with around five square meters of ground floor ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not sealed . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who appears after the lawyer of his lawyer , meanwhile , has once again been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his office @-@ term due to the insufficient liability policy against the country of Berlin was f@@ eit@@ ed .
&quot; however , the constitutional response raised the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and transferred the case to another test . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s man hurt .
chamber : now determines the amount of compensation
&quot; although for legal reasons of the questionable period a few days of imprisonment for compensation are decisive , a compens@@ ator was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a shor@@ tening of the li@@ king of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the chamber of the chamber must now be resolved as the height of the rep@@ lic@@ ism .
the constitutional arbit@@ ers in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
&quot; so they spoke only in April of an in@@ mate , too , because it was locked naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision taken by 2011 , according to the majority of people without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; Karlsruhe also confirmed that on Wednesday also the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had an in@@ mate in a parallel accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was held for three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell that in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons were also involved in the headlines over the past few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always enclosed 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rises , even to pun@@ ches it should have already been tense because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial black@@ outs , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior men , 19 shall not fall away . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are to come to Germany according to forecasts by the Federal Department of Commerce this year , by statement of vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take in a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated his face in the light of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say to you again and again : we can do this and we can create it . &quot;
what comes in Germany provides the following overview .
&quot; according to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Law ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments each year - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has ever built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatically this lack of housing is a lack of housing , but most importantly for a paid rental object : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are out of lease payments , and in order to apply these especially low apartments also refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , wants to double the promotion , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and , for this , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
estimates by the Institute of labor market and occupational research can be assumed that over 55 percent of the refugee population in Germany can be tolerated .
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically according to their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees too is crucial whether they work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording company , but also for self @-@ esteem of others , says Migr@@ ants Diet@@ rich Thr@@ ace . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt a political shift has been given : from the employment offered to refugees for the recognition of labor . &quot;
&quot; while earlier an employment offered for asylum seekers from up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residences that asylum seekers have placed on a residential location . &quot;
&quot; in the society itself - also because of the lack of qualified labour - by the majority of view , the view of refugees should be enabled more rapidly to access the labour market . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of Germany .
&quot; until now , there is still no extensive range of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often replaced by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt &apos;s view of the Königs@@ weg to the integration of people .
&quot; the Berlin administration has found that only a few parents show their children into the kids , estimated to hold ten to 15 percent , &quot; &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ haz@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate Chancell@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management put on hand paper in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - e.g. by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
in the countries student will be prepared without a knowledge of knowledge in the teaching classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by well @-@ trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ itu@@ ary from the Berlin School &apos;s administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; globally , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or commemor@@ ative studies - the only exception was Berlin , inside Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) but has now abandoned its stance . &quot;
study of refugees could be facilitated by the access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a grave claim or over@@ sight can no longer receive achievements after asylum seekers Act , if they begin to study . &quot;
the latter is basically not getting a BA@@ Fö@@ G because they don &apos;t fall under the circle of the wicked .
&quot; refugees had to have lived in Germany so far , to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G to be eligible from 1 January 2016 , from 1 January 2016 . &quot;
&quot; however , this finance gap has to be closed however , call Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Permanent Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in the future , Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually eliminate the same rights to Islam , as they have the churches , and develop the existing state churches right into a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the establishment of a Islamic welfare state , who professionally takes care of the new arrivals . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear and willing to work with the state in many areas and to offer some control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to address religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Commission of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who want to au@@ stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Broadcasting Corporation . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arab .
integration will continue to be a topic of society as of today .
&quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions , as a result of a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a General Equ@@ al Law . &quot;
&quot; it is a very slow pace , as the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what Migr@@ ant organisations and stakeholders have long demanded for a long time and undertake international agreements , such as anti @-@ racial loyalty Convention Germany , must be a reality in the coming years if the country remain peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany was able to medi@@ cally support the currently expected refugees , says Health Minister Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create that &quot; &quot; he said to the day mirror . &quot;
&quot; however , that need to flow additional money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to prevent bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery will be calling on all claims right under the registration of health types . &quot;
services could later be re@@ funded with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly questionable , so many people with the limited power catalogue check out which the asylum seek@@ er can see . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors are above all to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; hitherto , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that immigrants are elu@@ ci@@ dated more than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors &apos; practices would have to be taken care of interpre@@ ter costs . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical research into the emergency @-@ out bugs . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; in refugee camps , approximately there are clearly more un@@ certain@@ ties , and among the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors were from their training , but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize , and what concerns the sle@@ ep@@ iness is through the refugees possibly even reli@@ eving in sight . &quot;
the Syrians had a high @-@ developed education system ; several refugees are even doctors .
&quot; to practice it , however , they would have to re@@ prove their qualifications and take another look . &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming to Germany is the estimates of the bund@@ ling ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill . most suffer from trau@@ matic stress disorders or depression .
&quot; especially vulnerable , refugees sk@@ in@@ ert , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study published by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorders , suffers from among others to the so @-@ called bot@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and deaths . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are in@@ som@@ nia and concentration disorders , strong sho@@ vels and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically female seekers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead to often mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites for dreams
&quot; with the new staging of &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; the Circus develops on the traditions of cir@@ c@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to pull any age group in the ban of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the tiles .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without being alive without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie , &quot; &quot; teaches , and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ plate staging . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus saw in the hands of the family . &quot;
the gift to life is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday crowds and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior company . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ ica with world @-@ flair , &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard &quot; &quot; gives his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour , this flair can now experience . &quot;
the programme of the cir@@ cus filled with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awards at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with wit and charm in their spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their crafts .
with the heroes of the m@@ um@@ bs it wants to take up the Cub@@ an duo .
ligh@@ tness and mobility - these words identify them .
their hum@@ orous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s her@@ ons in the storm .
&quot; except through numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus comes also with flair and jo@@ ck@@ iness . &quot;
with the bike on a bul@@ let balance ?
for He Yuan no problem .
slim people are fascinated and scar@@ ed at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
failure in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie , also takes position : &quot; &quot; it is not good to our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged arti@@ sten &quot; &quot; as it is lovingly called , is possible after every wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal do not feel well it doesn &apos;t want to be into the arena .
the upper@@ most order : good for the animals to ensure .
&quot; especially at her z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ eb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is pro@@ dig@@ al . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a en@@ closure for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo there , &quot; &quot; Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid isn &apos;t yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus . &quot;
so for every visitor something might be possible .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Steph@@ anie , &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; the Circus , invites from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 8 pm . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is Family Day ; the prices at 17 o &apos;clock are reduced .
&quot; furthermore , the animal is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ pl@@ ev@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , African leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium . &quot;
&quot; last but he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly became popular with social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also di@@ mm@@ ed by the claims of Members of the Opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had been bu@@ sted and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the word he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; speaker of the Movement for Democratic Movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said , that seven op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS messages sent on their mobile phones which they warned of inter@@ rupt , Mr. Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; they warned the affected Parliament members that the immunity of the Parliament ceas@@ es , and once they have left the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the leader said the party of Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &apos;s party is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 25,000 and 30,000 jobs within the restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will be split up later this year in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
&quot; the expected period of claims leads to a burden of more than $ 2,@@ 7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , which is to lead the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes more smaller and more focused than HP today is , and we have a wide and abundant portfolio of shops that will help companies move into a new style of business , &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US pro forma revenue and is focused on providing thus far @-@ reaching technology solutions for companies , &quot; says an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , who called electro @-@ installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to master the driving from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the most recent in this area that is based on the conviction that works closely focuss@@ ed companies . &quot;
FC al @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates are facing the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
&quot; he pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it would be until September , and unless his rehabilitation go according to their plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
this optimistic scenario actually means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and certainly still uncertain due to its history in the next summer .
&quot; the big shame on this present issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate dum@@ mies , and then returned to his old swing during the early season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which is not well healed . &quot;
it is not a major affair .
this was just an accident .
it was not in combination with his kno@@ bs or with the injuries he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical perspective , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
&quot; he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als , 157 pro@@ pi@@ per , in the last five game seasons . &quot;
&quot; the wider image of arsen@@ al is that they have been in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League Clubs , which have noted most of the vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injuries ended during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an accidental period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain strength &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ ign next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team . &quot;
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not have travelled to Croatia meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Ni@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and to give players that need a little off @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing field with the largest intimi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o has also been ki@@ cked off after 41 years after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken in the Tuesday evening by a qu@@ ake , on the Richter scale . 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has moved out of the past season with the Champions League of Monaco and remains off the distant hope , with his management the association to lead the association to his first European ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; L@@ ess said . &quot;
it has never worked out at arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendly Fe@@ ast : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now have become more des@@ perate than ever before , as self @-@ mur@@ ders found among young men on a 15 @-@ year fold . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death penalty for men at the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain and it remains common three times more frequently in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ology ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ al@@ ous life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of putting the culture in question to seek help if they need those . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study on more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms stated that when the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery will double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends are the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends only once more so that a friendship may work .
&quot; in the age of social media @-@ run communication , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to make strong , li@@ felong and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and like a video inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really really not buy . &quot;
&quot; the Beautiful at Friends , was that this focuses on the head was placed . &quot;
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which creates through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments of foot@@ ball@@ ots in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can deal with it , even if they often hold themselves back to discover completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of the phone past@@ oral care I explained : ... &quot; &quot; my list@@ eners for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ friendly , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term work@@ able mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ si@@ ders status via phone the people in ey@@ esi@@ ght of despair also likes to help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest alongside the celebration of the day completely re @-@ designed scenery , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you &apos;re in Star@@ bucks eh alone , give him a smile and tell him hello . &quot;
one never knows which difference your friendship could make .

di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Don Cav@@ ani after his results in Malmö .
&quot; di Maria met at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , and helps PS@@ G to go over to Malmö . &quot;
here are the player &apos;s report and reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Ner@@ son Cav@@ ani held the course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain won his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö at the Prin@@ ted park@@ on on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ s as PS@@ G &apos;s player , who succeeded in the French Master , but afterwards she watched a number of occasions before they finally increased its lead , when Cav@@ ani made a ball@@ ad in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A takes a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they asp@@ ire not only the qualification for the finally , but an improvement on the road to the fourth quarters of each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an ot@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s recru@@ ited chances in front of the gate . he later became in the game against his hometown team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ stream in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to gain , our enemies problems to cause and relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not see one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; according to his injury in one of three amendments to the Paris team again , following the weekend was a 2 : 2 Bel@@ ly decided to hold on his own court against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was turned into the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine whis@@ per became known as the man who passed the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he ran into the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defense , before going to Johan Wil@@ and finished nicely in the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in an Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , arrived at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national games on the field and was ranked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle deck ranked a severe enemy . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed over to Kevin Tr@@ el P@@ fo@@ sten during the 3@@ 4th minute they offered little by attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself , with some de@@ pl@@ es@@ ses and bad notes , not least by P@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the restart . &quot;
&quot; despite this he pointed out a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a pass from P@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which turned Di Mary into a shot , which by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2. minute on the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally shortly after the hours of the stamp , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored his sixth after the sixth after his sixth fle@@ c@@ tor , after P@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back in the game , and only an excellent entrance stri@@ ps from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ den , gave later that PS@@ G was a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league that did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient .
hat in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 changing to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi plays in Qatar since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; FC Bayern was obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at that time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish master , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times champi@@ ons League winner , two times club champion , two times European champion , one time champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca m@@ illing X@@ avi now that he was already standing before the departure from Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; he said to me , that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won then everything , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; he told . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a quote of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; h@@ men wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; to remember : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ gen@@ sman took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason , that X@@ avi did not inter@@ changeable &quot;
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ated man therefore works for the German record high@@ score : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explained , why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has captured Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great band . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; thus , he has given me cri@@ tically . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ t &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 had been going with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca at the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against the whole distance of the lawn , that switched the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) , and celebrated at the end of the royal power triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film @-@ creating
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on met the af@@ arian film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said , I will not need it behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a sequence of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , acting as this the need for alternative perspectives , and in terms of a black protagon@@ ists in the selected screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do not do it with the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian is fir@@ med . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produc@@ ers Ben aff@@ lu@@ ck and the Far@@ el @-@ brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists by discussing the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to reflect on it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a gro@@ ove , which is beaten up by her white col@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People set up for the fin@@ alists of Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on er@@ ts that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something , which we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion is broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded prior to approval by Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni exp@@ elled his anger over the clip by wrote &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - this is SO MU@@ T that hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 quotes and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate , racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teen Michael Brown killed in 2014 by a white poli@@ c@@ emen , the movement of Black lives Mat@@ ter achieved national impact and urged the legis@@ lature and authorities to form discrimin@@ atory practices against colored excursions . &quot;
&quot; in February , the voc@@ alist Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; as books and black lives , albums have still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black lives Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and as a reaction to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth H@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be seen as a study group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; they said the guides . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ments , producers and media artists , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos; American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos;s First Champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was first Ath@@ let , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; competition show , which just ended up their 7th season , had never experienced a competition , which was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , came to the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on the last task , the climbing has been part of a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ritten ended the task within the time when he was the first athle@@ te , who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 from American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however Cal@@ di@@ ero completed his challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock on winning the great prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned over 10,000 $ or have life , &quot; says Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot;
suddenly as suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the exec@@ uting producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he first ended the course , not any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one at the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much the money is a wonderful price and life is changed , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s going on a gro@@ wer .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac had felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for one du@@ p season . filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ anders about Minnesota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tiger .
earlier they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the tiger on the last place stand in the American league Central .
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , they played this part perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins ended up an opportunity for Ascension within a season of Houston Mon@@ ros for the second American League game .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to write about a big part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; tiger says manager Brad &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept up his early offensive support when Detroit offered three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) cutting 6 times to the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made possible three R@@ us .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in bull@@ fighting every game , and so I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the nom@@ inee tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three results , and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has fed up the dr@@ y@@ wood well , &quot; said Cli@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better in the event , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ us in the back at the end of the seventh moment , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Field of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a sh@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it replaced the left @-@ handed bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man having been facing , in front of the nom@@ inee R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run sp@@ elled a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the conclusion of @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ ges got the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was that in the major league leading 27 times in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ monkey hit a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit offered an Insurance run at the end of the ninth , I managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and reached the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed ring is S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save . &quot;
Detroit offered to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game by an even non @-@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ us in the first two inner @-@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game by the offen@@ ding list , after having been missing for one month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I have wished , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I got , and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter Hus@@ band gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z , launched by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ es in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand side , managed a further run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game when he tried to get to the third , what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers introduced in the second to achieved a one @-@ out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he was not very well beaten but he got the right place .
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , generated no points in the third inning before it replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three R@@ us with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ l San@@ chez were due to a violation of the wor@@ rier .
&quot; he studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of August San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the violations list , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris will be painted by the vulner@@ ability list , in order to start the twins . &quot;

hundreds of refugees shall be subject to Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden / Germany
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved in Wiesbaden are then to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters , as the city of Wiesbaden in the Tuesday evening . &quot;
it calculated with 450 to 750 next refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for that case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily destroyed .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; only in the last ten days , in the last ten days according to the government &apos;s premiere of the interim President , G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people in Hessen , Germany . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have established emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Ischgl : German military action in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Management Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive reflection about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw up the European states &quot; collective bar@@ gaining . &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the cup has passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is approaching our front door , &quot; he said in the Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on site to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on the Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , and now no one will be returned . &quot;
also Germany did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is as agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement on which Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already been responsible in a relevant conversation between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers did not call them and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria on the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , who requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders . &quot;
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting for the binding distribution of more than 120 ,000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ line and re@@ distribution of the people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will deal this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chancell@@ ery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel underlined , the people , the protection , and bo@@ wed them too . &quot;
&quot; but who do not have a lead perspective , could not remain in Germany too . &quot;
this view was shared in the round in hand .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; enormous effort of force . &quot;
&quot; thousands of des@@ perate refugees stuck in the Balkans in the meantime , too . &quot;
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres of border with Serbia on the night to Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent the smu@@ g@@ boat gro@@ o@@ ves over Romania , Hungary said foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had c@@ utt@@ ings the fence .
in Turkey the eye causes more migrants say about thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border .

these include researchers from observations of the room son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; thus , the moon goes easily on its way around the ring planned . &quot;
&quot; this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a thoroughly solid ascension , in the message of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US @-@ state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers make their analysis of the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; analysis .
longer it was known that it has to be placed under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid water .
&quot; so , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice @-@ ic@@ ane on the south pole of Saturn , the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring des Saturn . &quot;
at least in the south @-@ pole it was necessary to give a shelter to the sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
but the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear however .

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ goes included a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line , then they will often get out of them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are nevertheless : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Over@@ all contain man@@ goes but much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who eats the fruits thus supports visual acu@@ ity , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell . &quot;
the form@@ work color just says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ goes very tasty .
&quot; they should be stored at room temperature , and consumed within a few days . &quot;
then taste them naturally pure or in sweet food .
a Man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it uses the slightly bitter taste man@@ ic bl@@ el@@ sal@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

&quot; after F@@ itting morning on Thursday morning , a distinctive cold @-@ front , which brings powerful rainf@@ alls , wind arches and a temperature change . &quot;
&quot; as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British islands in a strong south @-@ west view . &quot;
&quot; on the alpine @-@ side , the night will break through the valleys . &quot;

&quot; overall , south of the Alps must be reck@@ oned in the next 48 hours , with some over 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meter , this has already been large rain levels over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the catch on the air goes out , in the episode rolls a cold @-@ front with strong , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east on Switzerland . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther space
almost 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther Square .
&quot; in the presence of Stadt@@ leit@@ Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday there was no previously named court in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German reform@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live over the centuries as a minority in the dark . &quot;
&quot; thus , the space will be visible in symbolic ways that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k by the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city at that time as a comm@@ itting sin .
his negative impressions are likely to strengthen him by historians in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther had then introduced his thes@@ es against the de@@ ple@@ ading the split of the ab@@ end@@ ent church .
hammer artist invested three years in his personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works painted in Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , who now has appeared with gorgeous paintings now . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who had formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 reasons . &quot;
its &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes did the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what &apos;s not at all syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the individual themes have been adjusted , which can indeed be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; some three years Ot@@ mar Old has worked on his bi@@ ble Project for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; &quot; books of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , these are issues like cru@@ el@@ g , pl@@ agues , commandments or &quot; &quot; father@@ hood &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he was spontaneously fascinated by several partners : this is true for the Lu@@ ther Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with his emphasis on art books .
and there is mainly the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post who has gr@@ asp@@ ed himself on the basis of painting with the respective scriptures .
&quot; it has interpreted the Bible study of the &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; and thus translated into present @-@ contexts . &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; nestled between the original Bible Study of Martin Lu@@ ther and a set of the artist , who here is formulated his entirely personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows at twice a profound insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were finally an@@ trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ ite Order . &quot;
&quot; and the education happened already by the tube , &quot; &quot; recalls the Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work out that , in order to be able to carry myself again to the Lord Jesus again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to be more important to art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of picture @-@ worlds is co@@ ined by complaints today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed there .
artists have a different lust and glad@@ ness to show things .
images always have a bit of secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to let the observer have taken up into the pictures , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post builds on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art , &quot; &quot; I like , as he understands with his pictures lives . &quot;
&quot; old , did not take care to grasp the Bible completely , but chosen for him most important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; it was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; said Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from the Lu@@ ther Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen life and find freedom . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler , both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility . &quot;
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction beginning for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made that were found , companies were commissioned , mod@@ elled on the ground floor for a round trip : one year later almost everything was ready - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X subway was the end again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration carried out for digestion , especially among the residents , who did not tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill was shown up , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will enter in October , but the first in Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still man@@ age@@ able , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ A intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 and the Bundesliga team a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; the soccer reaction is responding to the gl@@ it@@ ating situation in Germany , safeguarding the policy of its help in addressing the upcoming issues . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country , since the re@@ unification of our country . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , it goes without saying , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in the touch of every single issue , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche B @-@ Chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to study the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or@@ ate and visit the State Minister for Mrs. Mar@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; since the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs should be put to politics .
the German soccer league has therefore extended its initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Juli@@ ana / Malta . &quot;
even some federal states support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ eine demonstrate a clear sign when they are on the left @-@ on tri@@ bul@@ ls rather than usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We will help - # to be welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that all can help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen evidently of the &quot; &quot; Photo &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and describes the project as &quot; self @-@ comprehension . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every day , none can be seen . &quot;
&quot; we can use football states , no , we have to use our strength , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ se , Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the EM Quali@@ fication of Hungary against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; a large communal work in German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements have had their own projects in their own unique projects , be great . &quot;
&quot; equally great , that small and smallest associations are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous significance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; says Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP pre @-@ chief lose an eye in case of accident
&quot; the flagship of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye of several reports by the fall of July in the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; with the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen to a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ached , was power@@ less , then it flo@@ pped out to the road - that he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; is the co @-@ founder H@@ asso platform . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could work out his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the supervisory board at Wall@@ dorf &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully @-@ capable . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) and will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP here , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was standing in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ moti@@ fs of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , and since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; whether it is important to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; important is to be up , once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except geography ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ ated a corresponding photo and explained , he suffered the injury before being over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
he therefore comes with det@@ ach in Singapore in the weekend as little as a reservoir for the two gene@@ alo@@ gical co@@ ats Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button in@@ ires just like one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ ure in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback can finally be broken by Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europe League . &quot;
the national player is absent to the leader of the Bundesliga as well as in Du@@ eling with the FR@@ Y Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach could be open : &quot; we are expecting a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Chief Apostle Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher the World Master . &quot;
&quot; whether m@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used for use in all European league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les did however open . &quot;
with high prob@@ abl@@ ation he will also share the second game .
&quot; the for@@ ge statement of fellow @-@ players re@@ us that the Fin@@ ally opt for the BV@@ B in the European League has to be the goal , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; &quot; Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take away the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the pioneering role in Germany
&quot; in Germany , according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner in the change of the car technology . &quot;
&quot; the Cab@@ inet I decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ or@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ or@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Fair IA@@ A of a &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot;
&quot; automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Finance . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states who also come together with representatives from industry at the IA@@ A .
&quot; among other things , the company &apos;s strategy paper emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band output and a rapid decline on digital radio . &quot;
the testing of new technology is currently being created on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver &quot; no additional liability risks will be noted , &quot; the German government wants to verify the legal framework &quot; and , &quot; where necessary , to adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany aims to employ around internationally for driving the permitted maximum speed of self @-@ driving cars of 10 to 130 km @-@ kilometers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government also wants to use the Vienna Convention to amend the Vienna Convention until now only sees the individual as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes on an increasing extent the car &apos;s leadership , the driver becomes more and more for passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which record the environment and process the data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , exhau@@ sting vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany will appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the char@@ ms can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport Minister S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in injuries and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clear to clear . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars however still see themselves skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute &apos;s mandate on behalf of the audi@@ tor &apos;s DE@@ K@@ RA , the result is that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will succeed in the coming ten years , 32 percent will not believe in all about 31 percent . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surve@@ yed held by 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of digital hard@@ ships , only seven percent would agree to take control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , this could be about 15 percent in flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every vi@@ ed would leave the car under no circumstances .

the final decision should be handed down on September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo Rau@@ l the title , &quot; said Par@@ liam@@ ents Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ner during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; however , B@@ oll was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term arranged sponsor@@ ing in China . &quot;
the 34 years old German master is expected to come back on Friday .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end@@ ant .
it is a mix of quite big fashion show and a qu@@ ace of wax : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ in that thanks to video proj@@ ections make start@@ ling human .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ out@@ fits to the great star of the scene @-@ scene - and with it , that he put men in rub@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be so easy , now it &apos;s real &quot; , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk on the tre@@ adm@@ or ) , which is visible from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed his beginning to a show on his / her personality . &quot;
&quot; actually , if he had been against it , because &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit &apos; after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection was previously made at the Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s current work , written in the fashion history , without ever having a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ograp@@ her total work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ aming the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
&quot; 14 tons of material have the creators according to the specifications of the curator , Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are flu@@ ffy as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s t@@ ed@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashi@@ oned en@@ closure of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he took his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents should not have allowed him . &quot;
the ab@@ ject of fashion then went on to himself later .
he st@@ ole fashi@@ oned and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers who told Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but I bought it later on .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the gear .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion
&quot; in the past , things went on to long nit@@ rogen and to make pl@@ ums a few meters . &quot;
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes came into a large quantity for customers , which they put on board blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ j@@ ary flas@@ hes . &quot;
instead the mode is again important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener top , fashion played a larger role , then was pushed by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and on regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; bil@@ ised the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , who re@@ jects itself at the past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an increasing client @-@ level . &quot;
&quot; those who do not use any hard@@ ship in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot;
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ hren@@ bach Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association of the industry , with nine other companies in the branch of industry and embro@@ ider@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of revenue were broken . &quot;
private business transactions and also the wholesale trade there is almost no more .
our products can hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass hardware is produced considerably in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; moreover , weak@@ est of export , current to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points via environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula peasant was declared by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have a seal of quality , that shows that we are producing ecological and socially toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this applies also to the used materials . &quot;
Diplom@@ acy U@@ te Schmidt is taught at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Society of the West@@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to deal with the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there arises a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies who need to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design can often only be easily modified to hold a customer base . &quot;

&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold Co@@ unter@@ race at Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt was inspired , &quot; before that I could not start anything with traditional puppets . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ sp@@ ear@@ head for her jewellery .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern of silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; she also supplies us to the USA , to Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ys and surroundings . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador to the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ®
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not supposed to stir but Disney is still dar@@ ing for a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not according to &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; but rather a kind of continuation , which 20 years after the first film plays with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot;
this is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in periods of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy broader for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open and open to the outside in order to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group called for the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to enti@@ ce foreign investment and expertise and improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the central management group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging start @-@ ups and advance reforms will boost new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative comment on regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls , funding of state controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative comment will be created , that identifies sectors and companies that are not in question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it shows the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legal framework environment guarantees and open the marketplace , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also have controls on the powers transmitted to the company and make sure that companies decide how to carry out its business . &quot;
&quot; the statement also said that China will approve the border areas , new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; to open controlled sectors in the scope of an offer , public controlled sectors will open up additional areas for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the Government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will deliver the ri@@ ghtful interest of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by making the requirements optimized and the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting . &quot;
&quot; the first session was called the Re@@ qi@@ ang Re@@ qi@@ ang , and important guides like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury threshold in predat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ors and the consumers thereby have a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
&quot; consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , presented with the European Union , critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects neglected industrial and environmental policies , &quot; &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the border values of the nervous system should be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as ha@@ ik@@ silver or s@@ word@@ fish from the &quot; economic reasons &quot; of one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury , each kilograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; large predat@@ ory fishes , however , are already so strongly exposed to mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still valid fron@@ tier values are not allowed to be sold around 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14,@@ 5 percent are non @-@ negoti@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return of this relaxation , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the border values at other fish from presently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram Pr@@ eck@@ ni@@ ckel per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch has marked this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ ent@@ fish , such as car@@ p are mostly so low @-@ bur@@ dened to keep the planned peak values already today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ sen@@ ess at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a pearl of distr@@ actions that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a very poison@@ ous heavy metal that has an enormous amount of concern over the food chain especially in predat@@ ors .
&quot; the Federal Government is therefore saying that &quot; &quot; little quantities are already able to cause especially among un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explained on its homepage with regard to the prevailing maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; does not expect to be expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly associated with coal hydr@@ ation in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Federal Ministry , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ beck more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year out , two thirds of the total quantity in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been quoted in March of the paper . &quot;
in the past year pan @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cury in fish has already been among the most common health risks in the EU War@@ n@@ System RA@@ S@@ FF .
