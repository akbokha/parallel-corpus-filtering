II ) the protection of industrial sec@@ rec@@ y and other inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge approved confi@@ dential information is ensured .
&quot; each state turns towards the organization , including their assets , funds and funds , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials responsible for the tasks to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the privileg@@ es and exemp@@ tions of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will be terminated in terms of core material , if the community and the organization has been dil@@ uted , that the material has been consumed or in a way that it is necessary for a nuclear action , which has become more usable or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able under the point of view . &quot;
&quot; the community noti@@ fies the organisation in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement , based on core material from the states , subject to the securing measures after this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this Convention will be terminated in terms of core material , as soon as the receiving state will be provided , as in this Convention , the responsibility has taken over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization leads documents , out of which any transfer and , if necessary , the backup of the securing measures are produced on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , core material , securing measures according to this Convention will be subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as production of alloys or ceramics as agreed , the community with the organisation of one such use of material , under which circumstances can end the securing measures after this agreement in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the not@@ ary material during the duration of non @-@ application measures after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear cells .
B ) The organization and the community meet a regulation that will not only be applied as long as the core material in this Convention will be used as the core material for such activity .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , these securing measures will not be applied as long as possible . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures planned in this Convention will once again be applied once as the core material is being led again for a peaceful nuclear action . &quot;
the organisation will be held beyond the total amount and the composition of this material in the relevant state or the relevant countries of such a material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends to matters as among other things , temp@@ oral and proce@@ dur@@ ations for reporting , but does not conclu@@ des any case or under secret protection and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States carry the cost , which each of them will grow by their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the States or people who are subject to their territory , are subject to an extraordinary costs due to a special request of the organization , so the organization will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed by the organisation , as if they are committed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of any additional measurements and sampling which are demanded by the inspec@@ tors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the community and states make sure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance , or other financial security , can be taken in accordance with the organization and their officials for the purposes of the implementation of this agreement in the same way , as in citizens of the states . &quot;
&quot; each claim to determine the community or a state opposite the organization or the organization against the community or a state because of damage from a nuclear incident - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , which are regulated by the implementation of the securing measures after this Convention , will be consistent with international law . &quot;
&quot; according to the examination of the General Director General information that the organization has not been able to pay attention by re@@ examination , so that no nuclear material must be rejected by the stat@@ ute of nuclear weapons or other core spr@@ inkl@@ es , so that the stat@@ ute may take effect in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the stat@@ ute and may also take the designated actions there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained through the applied securing measures , the community or the state - as far as each of the two contra@@ ctual parties is affected - each representative opportunity to grant the necessary safety . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community or a state will find consultations on questions that come from the design or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states are entitled to seek , therefore , that questions that arise out of the design or application of this agreement , will be inspected by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the relief of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disp@@ utes with disp@@ utes to Article 19 or one from the Council , disp@@ utes which will be derived from the design or application of this agreement , and which will not be agreed by the organisation , the community and the states agreed to be agreed on by an arbit@@ ral Tribunal , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states are two arbit@@ rators , the organisation also ren@@ ames two arbit@@ rators , and the four so @-@ called arbit@@ rators choose a fifth , which is ch@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the community and the organization , or the organization within three days after the request of an arbit@@ ration , have not named two arbit@@ rators , so the community or the organisation can seek the President of the International Tribunal to ap@@ point this arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable , if within three days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth Ar@@ bit@@ ration , the fifth refer@@ ee has not yet been chosen . &quot;
a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ral tribunal is sh@@ able and all decisions require at least three arbit@@ rators .
&quot; the resolutions of the arbit@@ ral tribunal are binding for the organization , the community and the concerned states . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention occurs for non @-@ core values , the contract party of the contract are and members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is noti@@ fied , that its proceedings are concluded for entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
II ) if the organisation of the organization is noti@@ fied that it is able to apply their securing measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this agreement .
&quot; a ) The organization , the community , and the States cons@@ ul@@ ted each other on creating one of the contract parties via a change in the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The general manager teaches all member states of the organization immediately by any change of the Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention joins the day in force , in which the organisation of the community and the States receives the written noti@@ fications that their proceedings are completed for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention will remain in force as long as the states of the contract are of the contract .
the expression &quot; Convention &quot; means the agreement and the protocol used in this agreement .
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is , which is necessary to implement the provisions of the part I on securing procedure , such as required . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the proceedings specified in this Convention is the tim@@ ely discovery of the di@@ as@@ sign of significant amounts of nuclear weapons for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ mers for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ ment of a di@@ lu@@ sion with the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the objective of the target , material accounting as a backup measure of fundamental importance , enh@@ ancing with spatial input and observation is used as important supplem@@ entary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material pre@@ ference zones that is not listed for a certain period of material , the accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen is listed . &quot;
&quot; when conducting research , the organisation makes provision for 3 full use of the community system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material zones .
&quot; under the use of their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures are used and measures the following type of use and they are required , as far as they are going to be closer and useful services are : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of inherited , produced , lost , lost , lost or in other way from the stock of the core material and the stock market ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement un@@ certainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and valuation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
E ) Proce@@ dures to evalu@@ ations not measured values and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and the reporting system , which points for every material store zone and the changes of this top , including one - and outputs of the material illustrated zone ; &quot;
g ) arrangements which make sure the accounting procedures and compatible will be performed correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to refund of reports to the organization in line with articles 59 @-@ 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention does not extend to material in mining or mining .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet achieved a phase of the core of the nuclear stream in the states , so the community for the organization and composition of the material , if it does not be introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves the core material that is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , which is manufactured or the process phase , in which it is produced , or will this core material or other , in a later stage of nuclear fuel circul@@ ating core material , it is subject to the other in that Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safety measures contained in this Convention will not be implemented for core material under the provisions of Article 11 . however , the community is subject to the assessment that the recovery of nuclear material , the securing measures imposed by this Convention is not possible or desired , so consult the organization and the community via the application of suitable backup measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safety measures contained in this Convention will be closed for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community will discover that this core material is practically non @-@ recur@@ able . &quot;
&quot; looking for the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures to this Convention : &quot;
a ) special f@@ iss@@ ile material when it is used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if the core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a is@@ ot@@ open@@ concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; in seeking the community , the organization freed the core material that would otherwise be subject to the Convention to be subject to this agreement , provided by these securing measures , as far as the entire , due to this article in the States liberated nuclear material amount to no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kilogram of special p@@ iss@@ ile material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight by the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment that is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above natural uran , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) A total of ten metric tons of natural uran and rounded urine with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of enriched ur@@ anium , with a enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or less , &quot;
&quot; delivered free material material together with core material , which is subject to the safety measures according to this Convention , are to be processed or stored in order to take effect for the backup of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplem@@ entary abor@@ tions , which is required in the scope of the organisation &apos;s successful and effective yield of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , to determine how the proceedings specified in the Convention . &quot;
supplem@@ entary abor@@ tions can be extended or changed without changing the agreement between organization and community .
&quot; supplem@@ entary ab@@ dic@@ ation occur at the same time with or as soon as possible after the entry into force this convention in force . the organization , the community and the states are all efforts to enter this agreement within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement between organization , community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization is based on the basis of the complete inventory of inventory of the entire , the securing measures of this agreement in the States , regardless of its origin , and leads to this inventory directory , due to the following reports and results of their review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ATION ( NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to help facilitate special shareholders in the International Economic Cooperation Conference , to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the whole of the Member States will be bound within six months following entry into force and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their possible , so that this goal is achieved . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the organisation have cons@@ ul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC has submitted a table to the EEC , which is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is aimed at a special account under the name &quot; Special shareholders &quot; &quot; which consists of the agreements in accordance with this agreement to the special shareholders and used ( in this property , the organisation will be referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , and in this agreement , the organisation will be specified as the &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the special shareholders will be separate , separately from all the other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot;
the contributions are as follows : a ) the payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ affected Schul@@ er one of the Member State to pay the organization as a ste@@ wards of the special shareholders in the local currency of the organization in the relevant country .
&quot; B ) Payment takes place in two rates , although i ) is the first of at least 45 v . h . contributions within 30 days after entry into force this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed ; &quot;
II ) the second in height of the rest of the contribution to the 1 . January 1979 or at another time that agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking into consideration for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans required .
C ) Every Member State can afford payments to the above mentioned above .
&quot; according to the usual method of organization , the administrator takes part in the usual method of proportional drawing to cash or the school drops , to cover the expenses for the special acc@@ entu@@ ation and to balance the special shareholders in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee this loan , the manager can conduct the following factors following the conditions of the following factors : &quot;
III ) contributed to the extent that the international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic issues of the country ;
&quot; VI ) the composition , and the tendency of debt service of the country and its further loan loss capacity , without obli@@ vi@@ ation ; and &quot;
VII ) to circum@@ ference the extent in which the problems of the relevant countries can be carried out by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special agreement is the financing of a clear and rapid development program or pre @-@ deduc@@ tible development program , regardless of whether it is to be assessed and managed by managing the organization financed by the Organisation ( including a se@@ ct@@ oral selection ) , which is considered to be considered in accordance with letter b ) of the Pre@@ am@@ bel to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special shareholders must not be used instead of proper means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has been approved as part of a loan or plan for a programme or projects that has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 there are subject to special Pay@@ ments for the same returns conditions , which are generally applicable to the organization of development of development ; they are therefore refundable at ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special requests are granted in one or several currencies of the Member States , and are pay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
&quot; subject to payment of this prayer , directly to the organization that it ret@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; each special loan is characterized by a separate loan agreement between the receiving land and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each special agreement can be used for issues in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services , which are manufactured or are manufactured in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and that could be the administrator at the time of loan granted . &quot;
&quot; on the special shareholders in the currency of a Member State , the amount paid for the shareholders in the currency of a Member State is agreed upon as soon as possible by the administrator to the State Member State . &quot;
&quot; the administrator teaches up to complete delay of all special requirements for the EEC concerning the approval of the directors in preparation , and of the directors approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of withdrawal of special acc@@ entu@@ ation , the manager teaches the EEC four times per year on the development of the special loan , and the expenses for this issue . &quot;
&quot; the ste@@ wards transmitted the EEC as soon as possible , according to the conclusion of the financial year &apos;s financial year , an exhau@@ sti@@ ve sheet of the organization with an opinion of external machines of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; after a complete withdrawal of special notes , the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible , transmitted a detailed report on the initiative financed by the Special shareholders &apos; initiative and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the manager creates and generates suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special shareholders , which are paid out of the account and paid out of the account and the withdrawal to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the complete edition of the special shareholders &apos; issue of time to time a thought of thought about the status of the special shareholders , the continuation of the Group funded programs or projects and on all other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is due to be agreed on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , the EEC and the organization , if necessary , not into force , so the agreement and all of it shall be due to the obligations of the parties with immediate effect . &quot;

this agreement requires permission by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the legal provisions of each party .
&quot; the governments of the Member States noti@@ fy the Secretary &apos;s Secret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities , referring to the proceedings . &quot;
the Secret@@ ariat manages these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication of the ord@@ al approval of this agreement by the EEC .
&quot; this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of the Noti@@ fication of Noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is ab@@ orted in two judgments in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , with each wording is binding . &quot;
&quot; in consideration , the agreement in the form of a letter to change the An@@ hang@@ s A of the Protocol no . 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT en@@ acted the following VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ ATION : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physi@@ hysi@@ cs
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below , called &quot; Commission &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council &quot; ; &quot;
&quot; this program comprises the creation of a large experimental laboratory , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , its construction and operation of a common enterprise according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - below &quot; &quot; Common Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland is concerned with research work in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma samples and is well @-@ familiar with the relevant area . &quot;
&quot; because up to practical use of controlled nuclear devices are still extensive work , it is in the interest of the contra@@ ctual parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ taking and their respective research , who have gained a higher priority stage due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should be able to put any contract party in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma processes , and accordingly to the joint aim of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ efficient electri@@ fication production by using the controlled core fusion function , to achieve faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objectives of the present agreement , the parties defined their respective in App@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement defined research programmes , below &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot; &quot;

&quot; every time , if the parties to receive a new program , this agreement occurs at the place of or of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the Association &apos;s Association is realised through : - An appropriate participation in each of the contra@@ ctual parties during preparation and execution of the other party &apos;s programs ;
&quot; - exchange of staff among the relevant laboratory laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , signed in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreements , below , as well as the laboratories which participate in the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- Speci@@ alist right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; under the objectives of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the Association Agreement negotiated in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the association agreement concluded an association agreement called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible , agreed between the Commission and the States or persons , herein@@ after called &quot; association bodies , &quot; with regard to the realisation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom contributes to the agreement that Switzerland , at the time of the in@@ conc@@ ession of the present agreement , is concluded between the Commission and associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; agreements of personnel exchange &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland , with the date of the current agreement of the current agreement , J@@ ET , which has accepted it . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Eur@@ atom is worried that Switzerland can be contra@@ cted by any contract , whose goal is to be signed in the context of the present agreement , except association contracts or other similar contracts that will be closed from Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are assigned to the association with article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Association Agreement , in particular , to include the suspension of a steering committee , to the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , to monitor the best possible outcomes in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates at the Eur@@ atom program - represented in the following &quot; VG . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning the current or planned programs and activities in the field of the Eur@@ atom program , does not take this task in terms of research and development activities that refers to this agreement . &quot;
it promotes the cooperation and coordin@@ ating between the associated organ@@ ics and coordin@@ ate their T * activity in the interest of the two contra@@ ctual parties to the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss program as well as in article 1 of the present agreement which is reflected in the world to draw scientific and technological developments .
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Rules , VG requires one or more Swiss representatives at the consultants in the Eur@@ atom program as always looking for the relevant Swiss authorities . &quot;
the advis@@ ers given to the VG research shows that the funding approved for the Eur@@ atom program take advantage of the best possible scientific results will take this task in terms of all research and development work that is associated with regard to this agreement .
&quot; in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the directors of directors which has to monitor the execution of the Eur@@ atom program , and that is responsible for the capacity of the laboratories which are carried out in the framework of the program conducted in terms of research and development , which fall under the underlying agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best use of the staff and exchange for the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme . &quot;

&quot; containers and in@@ fusion devices are provided in front of shipping with an English and french language label , which included the samples contained in the 2 @-@ 10 systems to this protocol . &quot;
&quot; human full blood must be shipped only in containers , in which the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C throughout the transport . &quot;
&quot; in part II of this log @-@ called preparation and devices , ster@@ ile , ap@@ y@@ ak@@ y and un@@ toxic must be toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the broad@@ casts to the in@@ fusion of the equipment , as well as the solv@@ ent for dry preparations . &quot;
human whole blood is un@@ solved with a healthy human being and mixed with an appropriate anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
C ) that are non @-@ free from blood trans@@ fu@@ sions transmitted diseases as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and nur@@ ses .
&quot; the blood circulation is as@@ ep@@ tical ; the blood is led by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system in a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ solution was introduced in front of ster@@ il@@ ising . &quot;
&quot; after the completion of the blood flow , the bottle is immediately to be closed and cooled down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , it may only be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution should not be more than 220 ml per litre of human full blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration can not be reduced by 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously attached to the hand of the blood cells and the server ; determining the R@@ h factor is carried out by an investigation of blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or .
&quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for the blood group determination in individual countries , these are to apply . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use if specific tests have the non @-@ existing C , D , you and E . &quot;
the blood @-@ exchanged blood should only be used for recipi@@ ents of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human whole blood is protected in ster@@ ile , closed bottle before micro@@ organisms and can keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permissible only during testing and transport necessary times , which may be maximum 30 minutes to cool down the blood on 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentration of human @-@ red blood cells is a unit of human full blood that has been removed from the biggest part of Plas@@ mas .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit that has been won ; other blood @-@ body components may be available or can be partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or of a suitable aqu@@ eous solution which was added to the removal of Plas@@ mas .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product , however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is available on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacturing processes must be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the cancellation must be done under use of ster@@ ile , closed system , and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; if artificial aqu@@ eous solution has been added , the label is also available in its volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid , which de@@ compos@@ es in cent@@ ri@@ fug@@ ation or se@@ di@@ mentation of human whole blood . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through cold drying or any other method , through which a den@@ atured of proteins is avoided . &quot;
&quot; the dry product is easily dissolved in a water supply , which corresponds to liquid levels , from which one went to the substance of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the so @-@ produced solution may not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution may not have any visible sign of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a virgin sample ) have been found a dangerous salary at Is@@ oh@@ em@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ at@@ glut@@ in@@ ine .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood circulation , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood don@@ ate will not be used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ she@@ pat@@ itis , they have to use plasma aber@@ ration , which do not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods , the well @-@ known masses will reduce this risk in a comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid stra@@ it , from which one went to the manufacturing of plasma , corresponding water quantity is to add ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the water amount , which was made from liquid stra@@ it , which is made ; the solution will be subjected to the following tests : &quot;
II ) Rem@@ oval 1 ml solution is a sufficient amount of Th@@ rom@@ bin or calcium chloride so that the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C .
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ tier drying processes in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d , less than 0.@@ 02 mm of mercury may not occur in the human dry plasma weight loss . &quot;
&quot; human @-@ dried plasma is in an embroi@@ dery atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , sealed bottle under exclusion of any micro@@ organisms and to store any moisture ; it is to protect from light and maintain a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma samples are preparations from the protein component , composed of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the Plas@@ mas of the human whole blood . &quot;
&quot; without regard to whether the final product should be flu@@ ent or dry , the preparation according to the addition of a suitable stabili@@ zers must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final order to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ she@@ pat@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be Alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G are allowed to be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the final product is frozen , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the fraction is made from human plasma rot@@ ein as a solution , so it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; to produce human alb@@ um@@ in as a solution , so it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ ing measurements of viscosity and exercise and cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges with the Ul@@ tra@@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and elec@@ trop@@ ho@@ re@@ se , which are made before and after heating in the solutions , no signs of a den@@ ying of the dissolved proteins can result . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 ° C and six @-@ scale sho@@ cks in a mechanical cont@@ actor at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The maturity tests with specific ant@@ is@@ era must show that only human plasma samples are contained in both preparations ;
&quot; II ) the elec@@ trop@@ ho@@ res@@ is characterized by fre@@ ech@@ ing particles below in@@ adequate and suitable conditions , that the protein intake of the normal human plasma have to contain at least 95 % of human alb@@ um@@ in at least 85 % of protein mass . &quot;
