the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) published in which the study is assessed as the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the package b@@ eil@@ age ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; for more information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , failure and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder , in which patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal heart rate ) altern@@ ately altern@@ ate with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who responded to the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used to use or the melt tablets in patients who prepar@@ es the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to enable the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin is playing a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , elimin@@ ating psych@@ otic or man@@ ian symptoms and their re @-@ occur . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the symptoms of the symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study carried out the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo in another study compared to 160 patients , where the man@@ ian symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that had been compared to placebo ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets , and the solution for inclusion . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , received significantly greater reduction in symptoms that received placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the use of the bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was less than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks . in addition , placebo prevented the re @-@ appear ep@@ is@@ den in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased more effective than placebo in the symptoms and were similarly effective like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ cellular dys@@ functions ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ ite ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy believed in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and of medium @-@ serious episodes of patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l said to the risks convinced .
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injec@@ tion@@ ing solution in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ian episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day independently of meals .
&quot; an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day independently of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y effectiveness in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients at least 65 years was not demonstrated .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are clear ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of successive behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after switching to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased su@@ icides risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , failure disorders ) , cereb@@ ral mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases ( de@@ hydr@@ ation disorders , treatment with hem@@ or@@ tive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Late dy@@ sent@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; when an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated signs and symptoms of an Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry , the dose should be drawn into consideration , reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ ination or conditions that are in connection with sei@@ zu@@ res . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l associated with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an elevated death of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ wanted frag@@ ile events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ one or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk estim@@ ations for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic substances treated with direct failure . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ th@@ p@@ her , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; generally , a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain was observed as side effect , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers an highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to be expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have to be made . &quot;
the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively .
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose of the companion therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or es@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentration .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l have no significant effect on the metabol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) . &quot;
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to insufficient data security in the human being and due to which in the reproductive studies in the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled @-@ term study of 52 weeks with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , d@@ yst@@ ic and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia were treated compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ als ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study period of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled @-@ term study of about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under half @-@ op@@ o@@ i@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ an syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry and sei@@ zu@@ res , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus include hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or intenti@@ onal trans@@ itions with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ og@@ gy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of a survi@@ ation benefit is , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is suspected in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder using the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine @-@ receptor .
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day more than 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in binary of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on cleaning . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychological symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in a week 52 , 52 % of the patients ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) was similar in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study games , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ sign@@ - depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in reverse rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a lan@@ z@@ ap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with a minimum increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. , an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies , with a flexible dose of more than 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fic@@ t@@ ally or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to placebo or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on how lithium or semi @-@ op@@ i@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which were partly over 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic symptoms , compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ag@@ ati@@ zation during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation period prior to placebo , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated to placebo over the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in the prevention of a bi@@ polar return . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ ment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation will be cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elim@@ ination of the mean age @-@ life period is nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a phar@@ ma @-@ etic study sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients no sexually mature effects . &quot;
&quot; a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics found no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin , or the impact of the space to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study involving subjects with a varied liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of class C , which is not enough to draw hits on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity in repeat@@ able gift , reproductive sto@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ gens potential to recognize the pre@@ clinical data no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects um@@ bled a dos@@ is@@ dependent epi@@ thel@@ ial cell accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats from 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 to 10 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precipitation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gated by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkey @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. at the highest recommended daily dose of sul@@ fate - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l did not have found more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle de monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to Ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Late dy@@ sent@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is suspected in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder using the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day independently of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty at the swal@@ lowing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , can take the processed tray alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some cases , the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after onset of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies , with a flexible dose of more than 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo . &quot;

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
to minim@@ ize the absorption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability is recommended a injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on individual clinical status taking into account the medicine &apos;s maintenance or acute medicine ( see section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems that were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ az@@ ep@@ inen in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( as described or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , failure disorders ) , cereb@@ ral mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases ( de@@ hydr@@ ation disorders , treatment with hem@@ or@@ tive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle boo@@ sts , changing consciousness and signs autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ens , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ th@@ p@@ her , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; generally , a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known and un@@ healthy living , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ per@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one disposable intake in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;

107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study period of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; Incre@@ ases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ an syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etry and sei@@ zu@@ res , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus include hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al Dis@@ orders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ it@@ enti@@ re@@ ty and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms with regard to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference poor . &quot;
&quot; the observed average improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS reaches Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ it@@ enti@@ ousness , a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychological symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in a week 52 , 52 % of the patients ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol was 73 % in both groups in a half @-@ op@@ ic @-@ controlled study . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study games , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction of decl@@ ining rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a lan@@ z@@ ap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with a minimum increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. , an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the medication associated with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the efficacy of metastatic breast cancer , only the patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no distinction between the disease and survival compared to metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in regard to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neutr@@ rop@@ es in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients with whom the first treatment is no longer add@@ ressing , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines will not be given to other drugs to decrease effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission awarded The Abra@@ xis Bi@@ ci@@ ence Limited to a approval for the per@@ imeter of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ olis &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in case of sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment can be interrupted , up to level 1 or 2 is reached , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on un@@ question@@ ing and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulate formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have much pharmac@@ ological features as other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and have a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in the patients there should be no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles , up to the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ly number increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while un@@ mistak@@ ably with Abra@@ x@@ ane in the context of the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indic@@ ative patient collective is not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or based heart disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarr@@ hea , these are treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be practic@@ ed at pregnant or women in the tender age , which is no effective conception of contra@@ c@@ eption , unless the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is imper@@ ish@@ able . &quot;
women in the tender age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable verification method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be enriched during and up to six months after the treatment of no child .
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sper@@ mac@@ ane treatment because of the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and dizziness ( frequently ) which can operate on the traffic noise and ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ side effects , which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking significant hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects are listed in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in blood , reduced potassium in blood , reduced blood pressure : &quot;

un@@ hel@@ pl@@ essness 1 The frequency of over@@ sensitivity is calculated based on a definitive in the case of a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
&quot; as these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and no real connection with these events have been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli drug that promotes the combination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tu@@ b@@ ub@@ b@@ uli and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing its de@@ oly@@ mers .
&quot; these stabili@@ zation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and as part of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the transportation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy in patients with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ uble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 than a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % due to metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are laid down . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 experienced .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for le@@ vers on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatments was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; the effect of CO2 ( AU@@ C ) is linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased to multi@@ phase ways .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or course binding from pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 , with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ uble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; after an sol@@ uble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solv@@ ent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average dose for cum@@ ulative action was 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , about patients aged over 75 years are only a few data available , since only 3 patients of these age group participated in the phar@@ ma @-@ genetic analysis . &quot;
&quot; the chemical and physical stability was found at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , and in front of light , protected over 8 hours . &quot;

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels , in the context of a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be conducted under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his counsel@@ ors if they have an appropriate instruction .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be controlled prior to treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency is to be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems may cause an@@ a@@ emia caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or that the body cannot be sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ ine . &quot;
ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in will also be applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was transferred to the formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to an injection in a V@@ ene in the context of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who caused an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
all patients participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks for E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o before they were either re@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 @-@ 29 .
&quot; the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin were spec@@ ulated se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients who caused am@@ an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were placed on se@@ amed were maintained in the same measurements , as in those patients who continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ icker , headache , and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or other components . &quot;
&quot; un@@ se@@ amed as injection below the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the medicine has been demonstrated according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality - security and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
&quot; the company , emplo@@ ying the se@@ amed , will provide information about the medical specialist in all member states of information , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , issued a approval for the transport of ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multip@@ licity are received by chemotherapy due to the risk of trans@@ fusion ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 - 8,1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , if hem@@ or@@ tive measures are not available or in@@ adequate , with planned greater operating instructions ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign bl@@ ut , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to a large @-@ elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications can be expected . &quot;
&quot; HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which can not be able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood circulation programme . &quot;
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie . &quot;

a rise of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s can occasionally be observed or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ tie target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ar exceeds by more than 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the long @-@ term hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ge value 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) exceeds the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa dose of 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored too close to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is the lowest @-@ approved dose , which is required for checking the an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hal@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) possibly require higher maintenance doses ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) , in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hal@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) possibly require higher maintenance doses ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) , in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 kg / kg three times a week with an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 kg / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored too tight to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is the lowest @-@ approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value , the dose should be retained twice a week or 450 kg / kg per week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase was &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 kg / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 kg / kg 3 times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl each week , the dose should be kept from 300 to kg / kg each week . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value , an response to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ sorting order of ≥ 4 blood pressure is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ ors will begin , so that before the start of the se@@ amed treatment , large iron reserves are available . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dose is 600 i.e. / kg Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given a weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively will be 300 kg / kg each for 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a f@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to wash the hose and ensuring a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from treating any ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not be ill or another ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine ( see section 4.4 - Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep cl@@ as@@ mb@@ osis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ stic known th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous orthop@@ edi@@ c treatment , the use of ep@@ et@@ ine cardi@@ ac disease , peripher@@ al arter@@ ial disease , vas@@ cular disease of the cardi@@ ac disease or cereb@@ ral mal@@ icious disease ; in patients with recently built heart attack or cereb@@ ral pal@@ sy event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of years with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; in patients with sudden impact loss , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / d@@ dl per month ) with increased demand ( ice @-@ acid , acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium @-@ oxid@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ ti@@ c@@ cy@@ te value is normal , taking into consideration the an@@ a@@ cy@@ tes ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) which is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / mic@@ rol@@ ite or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine antibody should be identified and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity using sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ per@@ ation in patients with an risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , in case of maintenance therapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese @-@ stim@@ ulated active ingredients ( ESA ) with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) were given . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration is increased to the control of an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / d@@ dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month , and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of hyper@@ tension . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical trials in@@ suffici@@ ency , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in paragraph 4.2 of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia should not be accelerated after the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency which are yet not di@@ aly@@ sis of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
cancer patients with chemotherapy should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 weeks delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ fun@@ ct ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is larger than 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ al an@@ emia ( see Section 4.2 ) of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic an@@ emia ( see Section 4.2 ) to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl . &quot;
the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in particular patients who should take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic proph@@ yla@@ xis , they should have an increase in thro@@ mb@@ osis and vas@@ cular disease , especially in an initial cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events can be excluded from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with an initial weight ratio of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was not demonstrated that in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia improve overall survival or the risk of tumor growth . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy once received a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l )
&quot; ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in will be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; from in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissue , there are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F related to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of thro@@ mb@@ al , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dic@@ als , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ med , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treatment , such as patients under ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common adverse effect during treatment with ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can occur after repeated bleeding in thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically modified ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is gly@@ cem@@ ic , and regarding amino acids and carbohydrates , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ tivir@@ al patients . &quot;
&quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mark@@ eters , ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa was specifically stimul@@ ating the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese and the Leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese are not affected . &quot;

survival and tumor divisions were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were randomised controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no distinction in the overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treated patients and control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treated patients with an@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ ant consistency , statistically significant , statistically significantly increased mortality than in controls . &quot;
&quot; overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine patients , and with controls satisfactory . &quot;
&quot; there is an elevated risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumor patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied , as far as these results are treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;

&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mark@@ fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributable to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

&quot; during increased or offensive cali@@ bre , your doctor may consider a interru@@ ption of treatment with dis@@ se@@ amed up until the potassium values are back in the norm range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney problems and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust sign through in@@ adequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s would not exceed a specific value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings by the treatment of blood ar@@ arms with im@@ pregn@@ ation in adults with chronic ren@@ al kidney ( kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into consideration for the assessment of the effectiveness .
200 Your doctor regularly determine your values of red blood color@@ ant ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dosage to keep the risk of a hem@@ og@@ rop@@ ath ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ical event ) .
&quot; this risk should be highly respected compared to the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , especially if you have occurred an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ al vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have already thro@@ mb@@ al vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ter@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed can effect as a growth factor for blood cells and can affect the tumour neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; if a bigger orthop@@ edi@@ c operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood color@@ ant ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because an increased risk of blood c@@ rop@@ hy after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken other medicines / apply or tested recently / applied , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory studies have no interaction between ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) , such as cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ( HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood im@@ pover@@ ished ( an@@ a@@ emia ) to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify your treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation value .
&quot; as soon as you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 % / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot;
your doctor will be able to verify regular blood tests to verify the treatment results and safegu@@ arding that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ar value does not exceed a specific value .

&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high fre@@ ading risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch as they had suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changed the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should be obtained from the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( average against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data collection for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ ra@@ ins and hips via a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two trials involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months . &quot;
main indi@@ ct@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone sub@@ distance ) in the blood was norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures were reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip fra@@ cture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; most of the side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequently in in@@ fusion . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ or or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion field and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis ( die of bone tissue ) in the pine . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as such material for patients , in which the effects of the drug should be explained and referred to as they should apply to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission awarded the company Nov@@ art@@ is Europ@@ harm limited to the distribution of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following basic functions include : • The package b@@ eil@@ age • contra@@ indications of calcium and vitamin D , reasonable physical activity , non @-@ smokers and healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When using medical or nursing aid &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently learned low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended annually . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic stress , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus passport . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long R@@ emis@@ pher@@ d@@ period was observed in patients who have responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently learned low @-@ trau@@ matic stress , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years old ) A Dos@@ age adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data is missing for un@@ question@@ ing and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) for only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ chlor@@ ic emia is pre @-@ treated with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D using adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , included in the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occurs ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer diseases , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be weighed in a dental examination with reasonable preventive teeth . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental gri@@ ps , no data are available if the interru@@ ption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate are reduced the risk of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw range . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of any patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk evaluation .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of serious adverse events reported by pre @-@ hop@@ ed cases was increased in patients who received ast@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the overall incidence of pre @-@ hop@@ ed between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable medicines are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; genetic function interfer@@ ing Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney disorders that were expressed as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. , an increase in serum sub@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , in connection . &quot;
the variation of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years in the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was accounted for by 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory results , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study patients treated patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the morph@@ s @-@ sequ@@ el studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical trials after a recent gu@@ ardian have been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw area is primarily reported , mainly with cancer patients , above oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the Kiev field ) , including bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had evidence for local infections , including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental treatment . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients re@@ joined oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis in the pine field at one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and with placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in case of an overdose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hy@@ po@@ cal@@ mia , it can be achieved by gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was performed at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone calcium oxide or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the balance sheet as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing body fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric acid fra@@ c@@ tures ast@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a permanent effect of over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hips in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine at 6.7 % , the total hips by 6.0 % , of the shr@@ ank by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic base . &quot;
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in bone @-@ volume patients compared to placebo in comparison to placebo and receiving the tra@@ ct@@ ular bone architecture .
bone replacement mark@@ er The bone @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP compared to 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output level up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP has been significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output level up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the output level up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D mirrors have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mort@@ ar was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased to all time points . &quot;
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total hardness and 4.3 % at the shaft .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were randomised , 508 men were random@@ ized and 185 patients was assessed according to the BM@@ D after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study involving males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Al@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was reported in comparison to the percentage of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at related to the percentage change in Len@@ den@@ dr@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated on patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically approved ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of in@@ fusion of 5 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
&quot; in case of combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain reduction was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified by the end of the six months main study as Respon@@ si@@ fied ( to the therapy ) were able to follow up in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who were treated at the follow @-@ up study , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , during a median duration of follow @-@ up period of 18 months . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ fu@@ sions from 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid with 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma markers decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a prolonged period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
high phase @-@ phase dis@@ appearing from the big cycle with half @-@ value hours t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a season elim@@ ination period t ½ x 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned t ½ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the prescribed dose is found in urine , while the remainder are mainly bound to bone tissues . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ cle@@ ance is independent from the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race , or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no impact on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely to met@@ abo@@ lized - because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is not met@@ abo@@ lized - because it is a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ related inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450 . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic cor@@ related cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; from this emerg@@ es that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function of up to 35 ml / min do not require a dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; because of severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are possible for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ acting intraven@@ ous individual dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ ples of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) were administered , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al impact . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application , ren@@ al toler@@ ability of CN@@ G / kg was administered as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which is sufficiently exceeded , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects in other organs , including Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common result in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ative primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a refund which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ sive effect of substance . &quot;
in rats one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at doses above 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or the embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed even though the maternal tox@@ icity of 0.1 mg / kg was expressed as a result of the lowest serum @-@ calcium mirror . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is a representative of a sub @-@ class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen , which are formed from Andro@@ gens , play a role in rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at dawn Pa@@ get , bone structure takes place fast , and new bone material is arranged un@@ arranged , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a acts as norm@@ alized the bone structure , thereby providing a normal bone formation and gives it the bones once more strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or care staff , if you have taken other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from which it is known to the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you should take enough liquid according to the instructions of your doctor and take care of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you from your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene .
&quot; if you recently have broken the hips , the administration recommended by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip break . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you from your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a seems for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in your blood after in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed immediately with your doctor or hospital to make a new appointment .
&quot; before termination of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , you will take the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please take your next medical date and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion occurs very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequently after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C can not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hil@@ ation , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip fra@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be adequ@@ ately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ u@@ ret@@ inal therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic abandoned , hypo@@ chlor@@ ic emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to at least twice a day 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hil@@ ation , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to a placebo as supporting means to setting the space . &quot;
&quot; the studies at the setting of the space showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to estimate on this application area . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper air@@ way were observed , the complete listing of the side effects associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported adverse events . &quot;
&quot; it may also be applied in patients who suffer from an existing depression or treat anti@@ depress@@ ants , as it can cause the risk of depression and among other things in a small minority of patients su@@ icides . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be evaluated as the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) , in which the Committee for Human@@ ism has been evaluated to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially over important patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another diabe@@ tic medicine ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially excessive patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in alone can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fur @-@ material or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ish or insulin can be retained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be improved , and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ one was examined in tri@@ ple@@ xed therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ material , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels have been reduced in use of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ ural therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl product in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin were examined in 289 patients , the patients who increased in addition to insulin represents a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual dysfunction , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied either in patients who may react sensiti@@ vely to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a ( high ket@@ on@@ - levels ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission awarded the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited on the distribution of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on a page the inscription &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bly ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced melan@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure showed that however , not to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm range ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used as pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors can be increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the liver enzyme values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has developed symptoms that point to an err@@ illa dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , over@@ l@@ eness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ matic values . &quot;
the decision to determine if the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be initiated by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir in fat storage and in some cases associated with fluid re@@ ten@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a Hä@@ modi@@ fier , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ on amounts ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity , in patients who received Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fur @-@ based combination therapy , the risk of dos@@ ing dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on a appearance or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ ma , but the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ma should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular statement ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic statement should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events concerning bone breaks out of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &quot;
the calculated questionna@@ ires was 1.9 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wish a pregnancy or occurs , is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on examination of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one do not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or are not expected . &quot;
for simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ thy@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance to the parent &apos;s pregnancy and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the rub@@ b@@ ish growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of Tur@@ g@@ ors and the Bre@@ eders of lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T sei@@ zes three times the upper limit of the norm range frequently as frequently as placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with the existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease , incidence of a severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than under Placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , rarely about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been reported , however , more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ history . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events concerning bone breaks , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with the compar@@ ative group treated groups . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3,5 years of the PRO@@ active study , Fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ az@@ on patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to operate on a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( e.g. P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) which leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver and fat and skel@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and the peripher@@ al glucose recovery increases in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until subsequent treatment of therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite a three @-@ month optimization period with insulin in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on group was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ at@@ ite / Kre@@ at@@ inin Qu@@ oti@@ ent , compared to the output values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study on type 2 diabe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and a minor , clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the sober @-@ tri@@ glyceri@@ de content , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial elevated tri@@ glyceri@@ de level , this has an effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption of the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced melan@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy , either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after an application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one becomes quickly res@@ or@@ ised , with the peak concentration of un@@ changed pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma generally 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
for simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the barrel ( 55 % ) and found a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination life of the un@@ changed pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral cle@@ ance of the mother &apos;s breast are similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and apes , after repeated administration , plasma volume magni@@ fication , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trop@@ hy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ thy@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance to the parent &apos;s breast and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the rub@@ b@@ ish growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by the rat bur@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epi@@ thel@@ ium .
&quot; in a veter@@ an model of the familiar poly@@ pos@@ i ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an elevated frequency of Kol@@ ont@@ um@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on a page the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the calculated questionna@@ ires was 1.9 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .

&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de have been studied . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin Qu@@ oti@@ ation showed a statistically significant decrease in the output values . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the sober @-@ tri@@ glyceri@@ de content , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial elevated tri@@ glyceri@@ de level , this has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ glyceri@@ de absorption as well as to the O@@ asis Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ en@@ d synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which shows how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane lead to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were similar to similar to other human@@ ism . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human@@ oid ( r@@ DNA ) or any other components .
&quot; furthermore , cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane might have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can take effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is the packing unit ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission awarded the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ ation effect will be desired with a longer persistent effect . &quot;
injection no@@ bility must leave at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is in@@ jected .
&quot; patients whose blood glucose settings can be significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( quickly acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ oid or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) , a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients can be required a dose adjustment , this can be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin occurred , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or differently than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; prior to travel , that go across several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to get the advice of his doctor , because such travels can be applied to other times or have to be taken . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must take into account the potential inter@@ actions taken in the therapy and will always consult patients with them from their medicines . &quot;
&quot; 4 So@@ on hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia which can occur in a non @-@ sufficient diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ normal@@ ities and fruit to@@ d in u@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can lead to consciousness and / or sei@@ zu@@ res and with temporary or lasting distur@@ ban@@ ces of the brain function and even death .
illnesses of the nervous system gel@@ atine - Peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are known as acute painful re@@ rop@@ athy and normally reversible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin treatment with an ab@@ ru@@ ding improvement of blood glucose levels can however be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
disorders of the skin and skin cells are based on injec@@ tions - Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy At the injection site may occur if a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy could change within the injection area .
&quot; General disorders and complaints at the appointment site Gel@@ eg@@ acci@@ dentally - Local hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the injection site while insulin therapy can occur local hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; however , a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however be progres@@ sively developed : • Light Hy@@ po@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the or@@ als of glucose and sugar foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have sad@@ ness , sweets , cookies or sugar fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ phs with consciousness are treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is administered intraven@@ ously through the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who have already demonstrated signs of cryst@@ alline ag@@ ings including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or poison notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ at@@ cryst@@ alline joints that can lead to artic@@ ular and bone damage ) .
&quot; if the ur@@ inary acid mirror is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ites , the dose may be increased to 120 mg per day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ cies can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients are taking place at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for the prevention of gyp@@ sies . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , taking part in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( a daily drugs ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each day in 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was employed in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary mirror in the blood was under 6 mg / d@@ dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily saw 120 mg dose , with the last three measurements an ur@@ inary mirror in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart complaints in the history of history , an elevated risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary mirror in the blood was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ an@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history or currently present Gi@@ cht@@ el and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum concentration of the serum levels of 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , can be considered a dose of dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ as@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , when there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences yet with organ transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient &apos;s group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease patients with chronic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ vest@@ ing medicines , it can occur during the treatment in an acute g@@ low cause , because by lowering the serv@@ ic@@ acid mirror first to be mobi@@ lized in tissue in the tissue . &quot;

&quot; liver disease During the phase 3 clinical studies were observed , slight decrease in the liver function were observed ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ al treatment and subsequent alter@@ ations . ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin Z@@ was conducted no interaction studies on Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to a rise of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ ux ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin was also reported for other X@@ O shirts ) .
&quot; in case of subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen , 250 mg twice daily with an increase in February exposure exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not stand in connection with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without having a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at or at the same time required other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects suffering from 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , a medium 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicates that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme refers to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous use of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide ( around 1 hour ) was delayed and a decrease of C@@ max by 32 % but does not cause any significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not leave any side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at to the pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies does not allow to direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful during the tax of a vehicle , serving machinery , or exercising vulnerable activities , until they can be reas@@ onably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC didn &apos;t affect her performance . &quot;
a pay@@ able higher incidence of investig@@ ating cardiovascular disease was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ase group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statistically significant differences were found and no real correlation with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors involved in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the nur@@ ses .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events that could have been reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at therapy and in all Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at treatment groups a total of more than once reported are listed below .
&quot; diarr@@ hea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , no serious rash or severe over@@ sensitivity were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term renewal rates were 906 patients up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during long @-@ term - renewal studies reported related events were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and compet@@ ed in patients , the Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to data . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either reported in the p@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses either or with a lower frequency :

&quot; clinical study results of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were performed with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients with which the last three months of particular serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were in each study .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ en@@ circle value to study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed reference to the lowering of the serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) in relation to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority relative to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . 300 mg .

the lowering of the serv@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid mirror to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was kept at the physician &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently retain the entire treatment .
&quot; 509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with ser@@ en@@ circles &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl , received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function . the AP@@ EX study assessed effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function ( d. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) , and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 times daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there was no clinical significant differences in relation to the percentage of decline of serum concentration of subjects , regardless of its kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the long @-@ term reduction of serum levels showed up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment of tox@@ in ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required for a tox@@ in ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the gre@@ ed no@@ des size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearing of pois@@ oned notes of up to 24 months . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase is observed . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multi@@ pler oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma binding of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bin@@ ge to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width that is reached with cans of 80 and 120 mg , consistently . &quot;
&quot; in vitro @-@ studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly due to CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that February 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 is created mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , with which a risk of low vitamin D mirrors . &quot;
&quot; the patient needs to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the feeding tube , the patient may not take place after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest , 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , which come from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than for those who were exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at premium ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data on data , that is contained in the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cers , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , cast seed ( blin@@ dness ) as well as su@@ peri@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;

it is very important that all met@@ ering assign@@ ments will be handed over to the patient and to be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually @-@ prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;

careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation in Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance exposure to the immediate after@@ care phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition are not permitted in the first postoperative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to manufacture a in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application to supp@@ ression of transplan@@ ts , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression must not be maintained ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t impacts The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustments can be required later , as the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft impacts The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendation - change from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be converted to a daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so that this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , in relation to the entire daily dose to be made . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a conversion of other immun@@ o@@ res@@ s@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily needs to begin the treatment with surgery at the recommended initial initial dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ts .
&quot; in adult patients , cardi@@ ac transplan@@ t apply to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recei@@ vers Al@@ though there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ cre@@ - and study transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplan@@ t recei@@ vers in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood @-@ tal@@ es in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels ) , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf when switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the flow mirror in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of abor@@ tion and toler@@ ability in individual failure under grants @-@ t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ es of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , canned adap@@ ting , changes of immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations can require several days until the ste@@ ady State is re@@ signed . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , when the flow mirror in the blood will not exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the flow mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for decor@@ ations - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
usually blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were used during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver and liver transplan@@ t procedures .
&quot; this resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which may occur in sequence of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
&quot; patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; Modi@@ fication of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the narrow control of one in the corne@@ al transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which are proved against other immun@@ os@@ ran@@ si@@ va as therapy @-@ resistant , are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; to the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ ts with adult heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers and transplan@@ ts in childhood , no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf are still available . &quot;
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a decrease in the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing the cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other plant @-@ enh@@ ancers during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered since the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , used as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hy was described as well as Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart condition , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ ran@@ si@@ va , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection via a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us symptoms of symptoms such as headache , changed consciousness levels , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision problems , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ anza hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zes , l@@ act@@ ose , is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase @-@ deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and consequently reduce blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism to monitor the equivalent concentration of the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strong pronounced interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ con@@ az@@ ole and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiot@@ ic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies suggest that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal digest@@ ion , results . &quot;
high @-@ quality pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on how it is used with acute abor@@ tions to increase or cut the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ lized by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism process .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduced the cle@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is particularly careful in decisions concerning recep@@ tive action . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ ts provide no indication that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ ran@@ si@@ va compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ s@@ va in regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and plasma tor@@ ch can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;

&quot; L@@ ung@@ icide Plan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent analysis of a recent pro@@ gra@@ f was reported via 110 patients , which received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ ts , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated in the first year after transplan@@ tation was less frequently observed ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0,8 % in the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;

&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients receiving by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

in a study the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated in patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients .
&quot; Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ Transplan@@ t A multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients at the same time , based on a random@@ ized process T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ als ( by protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was thereafter to reach the target range from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ t@@ ations ) showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V @-@ infections , bone mark@@ enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists d@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , lead to tal@@ es between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently run gra@@ ft radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oma value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the imp@@ ending group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or an increase by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are intended to be responsible for transplan@@ tation observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ lized in front of the ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the ex@@ cre@@ ations mainly via the g@@ all . &quot;
&quot; for stable patients , which were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) at the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was less than under Pro@@ mis@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;

&quot; in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood canc@@ ers was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ thon ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ances may not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to human body factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted company B@@ ax@@ ter AG to auth@@ orization for the distribution of Adv@@ ate in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical state of patients . &quot;
&quot; in the following h@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII &apos;s activity should not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in that of the specified plasma signal ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , an adequate dose and frequency of injec@@ tions can stim@@ ulate factor VIII plasma samples . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differenti@@ ate in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activity will not be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be weighed . &quot;
&quot; after finding the patient , the appointment speed should not be increased , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing Anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII in immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is on the biggest and other factors within the first 20 ex@@ position days . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ct@@ able inhibit@@ ors , according to conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ Product to another , the re @-@ appear of ( advanced ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation has no experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all treated with previously untreated patients who showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data available ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculations ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation has been maintained during all the time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15 . postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavier to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 ex@@ position stages with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavier to medium @-@ heavy ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) according to previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) determined a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of patients on traces of con@@ amin@@ able proteins were analysed by the investigation of the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell@@ ulose , otherwise no signs or symptoms occurring on an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , about the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes was reported in several repeated product positions in the context of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported about over@@ sensitivity of allergic reactions from allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency is not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VIII works as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .

&quot; based on the available data available , the CH@@ MP has still considered a positive rating , but in consideration that safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security code of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply another renewal procedure for 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited shared the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company takes its request for the transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bone or the female parts ( tissue , which links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and leans ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified , that it can be a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which has been changed , that there is no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can solve in humans . &quot;
adv@@ ent Adv@@ ent should be in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , formed from the non @-@ defective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells , if DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company made data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of construction , in the bones and the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on which the questions were examined , still some questions were un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the inspection of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions that is sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors benefits for the patient . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns relating to the processing of medicines in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in reliable ways , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , harmful . &quot;
&quot; the company didn &apos;t notice the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; altered radiation release &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other has been released over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by a allergy against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water , or without food . &quot;
&quot; the treatment duration should be as brief as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measurements were the changes of the gravity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms that were reported from patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; for viewing of all loc@@ ust symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , above a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nostr@@ ils are considered , the patients below Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ ens ( heart attack ) , mou@@ th@@ iness , dizziness , psychological disorders ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ite ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze must not be applied to patients who may not be sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ aze must also not be applied in patients who suffer from hyper@@ tension ( increased eye @-@ pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( hyper@@ tension ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission awarded the company SP Europe to provide a approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to break , break or che@@ w ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied due to the failure of data to un@@ question@@ ing and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
&quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms . &quot;
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days as long as long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin with the time .
&quot; after down@@ fall of the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory due , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be continued as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , the medicine is also contra@@ cted in patients that are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , per@@ go@@ dless , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , oxy@@ gen@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collection and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment of hyper@@ tension , or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ fish or t@@ ach@@ y@@ fish , arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hy@@ m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ ination , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder cancer or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the history of the history of patients . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing the mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hist@@ amine was otherwise able to prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or in its magn@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who were given to ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ical tests , no significant differences could be detected between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; the in@@ convenience of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however no increasing the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; since the reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ on@@ strict properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases they may come to a drow@@ sin@@ ess that can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , contamination ) . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , weak microphone , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , nausea , vomiting , preventive pain , dizziness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ie , visual dysfunction and hyper@@ tension and hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children , as well as atrop@@ ine typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human body cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhes@@ ion cells to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; at an individual dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes , including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective beats or tasks that are connected to flying . &quot;
clinical trials received no increased incidence of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
&quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ s or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ om@@ aze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amin@@ ant effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined using the total co@@ res for symptoms ( except Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the ab@@ stain@@ ing effect , determines from the nose s@@ mu@@ cu@@ ous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin , patient sub@@ groups defined significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin to day 10 was reached . &quot;
&quot; as part of a phar@@ ma @-@ genetic multi@@ functional study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects Des@@ p@@ at@@ ad@@ adin badly mis@@ used . &quot;
one component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin according to the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was an exposure after the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity in a repeated gift , to Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the reproductive sto@@ icity , however , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not recognize any special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
in reprodu@@ cible studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the oral gift of rats used to rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; inform your doctor if you may occur or diagnosed with the following symptoms of Aer@@ in@@ aze following symptoms or diseases : • hyper@@ tension • heart ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhyth@@ ms • nausea and headache , or a ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; traffic noise , and the use of machines when using the recommended dosage is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ aze leads to drow@@ sin@@ ess or reduced attention . &quot;
if you have taken a bigger amount of aer@@ ob@@ aze when you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a bigger amount of aer@@ ob@@ aze than you should .
&quot; if you forgot the intake of Aer@@ in@@ aze If you forgot to take a dose on time , get the application as soon as possible , and apply the next dose at the time required . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or notice side effects that are not listed in this manual information . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing need , whi@@ st@@ out breathing , it@@ ching and swelling ) or rash are reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach pain , diarr@@ hea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zu@@ res , muscle pain , sei@@ zu@@ res , abdominal pain , sei@@ zu@@ res and cases of ob@@ tru@@ sive liver values was also very rare . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 m@@ g. tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 5 to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which are in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged from six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by removing the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to prove that the body util@@ ise the sy@@ rup , sol@@ ving the solution and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg ac@@ eri@@ us have received an average decline of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 26 % compared to the patients who received placebo . &quot;
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ erial us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo in 40 and 33 % were treated with placebo .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission awarded the SP Europe company to provide a approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to prevent the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are limited experience in clinical studies for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated according to the previous disease and can end up after the sound of the symptoms and re @-@ appear again .
&quot; in persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during everyday life time . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets in addition to which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not intensi@@ fied the powerful effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may come to drow@@ sin@@ ess , that can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; most of the most advanced side effects , which was reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ iness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect of headache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin and 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ study study , at which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human body cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhes@@ ion cells to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets , administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes , including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective beats or tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in preventing the symptoms such as ni@@ eses , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ ams and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot;
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the total co@@ res of the questionnaire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased the burden of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investig@@ ating for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria because the underlying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology considers the underlying path@@ ology to be expressed in different forms and chronic patients .
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ ination is an urs@@ ing factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may also be verified in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine , was excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the youth growth of more than 50 % was observed with 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ erial us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wa@@ iter than was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale on the assessment of these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which was comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients was a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no basis points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ ch , cal@@ ory rich breakfast ) is not included on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; with a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin who showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity in repeat@@ able gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the reproductive sto@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not recognize any special dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of the meals , to prevent the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the failed doctor should be aware that the most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data should be submitted to the treatment of inf@@ ek@@ ti@@ ous rhin@@ itis with A@@ erial .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations should play a role . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin and experienced a higher sub@@ stitution ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , restricted to metabolic , is identical to children who are normally met@@ abo@@ lized . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients should not take patient problems with a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose sy@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in the clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in addition to which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not reinforced with the performance of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ erial Sir@@ up group as the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ functional study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children between the ages of 1 and 11 years old who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily basis dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets in adults and adolescents , applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ology study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
in clinical trials the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected compared to placebo .
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets carried out in adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , an increase of alcohol is neither too ampli@@ fication of alcohol induced performance . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in preventing the symptoms such as ni@@ eses , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ ams and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total co@@ res of the questionnaire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decreased by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; the prolifer@@ ation of this restri@@ ctive phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than Caucas@@ ia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a phar@@ ma @-@ genetic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup forms of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis observed .
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a season half @-@ value of about 120 hours . &quot;
there are no basis points for a clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;

overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months , most of the most advanced side effects were reported , diarr@@ hea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and insom@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution were observed , observed no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended dos@@ ages , the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable to the child &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
in clinical trials the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected compared to placebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be found in depen@@ dency from the duration of the symptoms , also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company returns its application to the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N1 Influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect influenza which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine that might cause a strain of influenza that could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from humans , because human beings do not have any immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contains the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this is a result of the immune system later in a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus this ancest@@ or faster antibodies .
&quot; afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , det@@ ects the human body as a foreign @-@ bodied ) , puri@@ fied and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this resulted in the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the security of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s treatment . &quot;
&quot; for more information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules can be used as a solution for inhal@@ ation , but these cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be used , if the doctor tested , which has taken an an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in the patient before , and the li@@ kel@@ i@@ li@@ kel@@ i@@ fied that the virus is attached to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , together with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is aimed at body weight . &quot;
A@@ vent@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
&quot; AIDS is not able to heal , however , the immun@@ ity of the immune system and thus also hesitate to use the development of AIDS infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; it was compared with low @-@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ pr@@ ase , compared with 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had had more patients a virus load below 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ pr@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ men@@ ase had reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load was equally effective after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; in the patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ pr@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ us@@ load after four weeks as in patients who had their current prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ men@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ men@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to am@@ us@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are equally min@@ ed in blood and harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as in other drugs against HIV , patients who are taking the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis ( failure of bone tissue ) or a immune activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that are caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is generally taken together with the phar@@ ma @-@ genetic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee presented that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group to submit a approval for the distribution of A@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ men@@ ase capsules should be given to the phar@@ ma @-@ genetic boo@@ sting of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r together with low cans of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ men@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ men@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 When A@@ men@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ pr@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied daily . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ men@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of axial bladder in combination with low cans of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined at children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ men@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data protection and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on phar@@ ma @-@ genetic data , the dose of A@@ men@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be treated with patients with mild or moderate liver function , with patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medication which possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable supplements containing the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is not leading to healing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ast@@ er@@ ase prevents not the risk of a transmission of HIV on others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for usually , A@@ men@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy with an elevated risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal disease .
&quot; for the case of an effective an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with existing reduced liver function , including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis , showed an increased incidence of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ul@@ um or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ cor@@ ids , which are not recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment with systemic cor@@ nu@@ ster@@ oids , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the secondary function function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends heavily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ men@@ ase may be less effective for reduced plasma levels of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ oplast@@ y symptoms , in particular if there are also low cans of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity , this formulation is contra@@ cted for children under an age of four years , and should be applied to be careful with certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , has been reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an existing type of diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases resulting in their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ fact@@ orial equ@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis cases were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ vent@@ ase can not be given simultaneously with medication which have a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medication whose ingredients are predominantly connected via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with serious plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; in an attempt to balance the lowest plasma levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ av@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient has already entered Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ end@@ av@@ ir@@ es mirror and if possible to check the vir@@ us@@ load and add the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ating ir@@ enz ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max . if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ ing of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained in the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will not be well @-@ known as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ ing of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ men@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) . &quot;
therefore there is no dose adjustment in combination with Am@@ end@@ ir@@ enz ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ mo@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing data can be dis@@ cour@@ ged that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly lowers the concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medication should be used simultaneously , be careful since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; when this drug is applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rology surveillance should be made , as an exact predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ ver@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ ver@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus lead to an increase in related side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ver@@ ut@@ in combined with A@@ pr@@ ase will be given to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data will be present . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with axial bladder in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneously administration . &quot;
the simultaneous use of $ 700 mg of n@@ amp@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to a increase of C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ pass ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , when they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ uls@@ ants , which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower of the plasma concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , pin pin , ni@@ f@@ pin , ni@@ f@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , which may potentially increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medication . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations , and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with the side effects including mort@@ ot@@ apes , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days were decreased , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fic@@ t@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment of systemic cor@@ nu@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er shirts such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is dependent on the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are characterized by distinctive levels of plasma levels when simultaneously administration of A@@ pr@@ ase are expected . &quot;
since plasma tor@@ ques of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or can lead to my@@ opathy including a dom@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it will be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ ising the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ Gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral drow@@ ned Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while the same application is advis@@ able with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 @-@ F@@ ache .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given together with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ oplast@@ y symptoms , in particular if there are also low cans of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the extremely low reliability of historical de@@ vot@@ ion , no recommendation can be given as the Am@@ end@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is given at the same time when Am@@ end@@ av@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of increasing or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not pre@@ dict@@ able ; therefore also alternative methods of contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous er@@ ase of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful abor@@ tion of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk in@@ activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r goes over with people in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not affected by appointment of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the in@@ tox@@ icity of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment linked side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and often led to the treatment break . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether in connection with taking A@@ pr@@ ase or any other at the same time for the HIV treatment applied , or whether they are a consequence of the liver disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not pre @-@ treated patients 1,200 mg of A@@ men@@ ase received twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , as well as in connection with study medication , were listed and more than 1 % of the patients were performed as well as the treatment of laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of heavy and fast @-@ skin woven fabrics , hyper@@ trop@@ hy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fatty tissues ( p@@ alli@@ ons ) . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ s not pre @-@ treated persons treated with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in , only one case ( bul@@ let ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study enrolled at 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin set@@ backs were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ al nature , with or without it@@ ching , and usually stopped in two weeks without leaving the treatment with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ condition or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ men@@ ase twice daily together with low do@@ si@@ sted k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) , were kind and prevalence of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and including CP@@ K values , which were treated in patients with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose symptoms , the patient must observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) if required , are necessary supporting measures necessary . &quot;

&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood cells . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ at@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined yet .
treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r used treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
&quot; at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ ag@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a four @-@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 included , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were treated twice daily ( n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ rology failure about 96 weeks and the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on genetic resistance analysis of Gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resist@@ ence as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 60@@ 2A and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased ph@@ onic resistance to Fos@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ rology response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations samples can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations for analysis of resistance tests . &quot;
based on ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ical resistance analysis of clinical vali@@ dated analysis systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ ag@@ avi@@ r resistance block@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients , in which a Fos@@ ag@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ k@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early release of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a hum@@ ili@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ men@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in relation to the time @-@ adjusted average rate ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ sub @-@ loss shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of untreated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , with which 152 will be treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ men@@ ase has been tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there was no low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously in@@ treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered to be considered at the treatment optim@@ isation of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ned &quot; A@@ men@@ ase in the treatment of treatment with PI .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max . if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dos@@ ing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake increases the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ at@@ avi@@ r from the blood cycle into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r that represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active inventory during the dose of dos@@ ing concentrations in the ste@@ ady @-@ state above the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines containing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be induc@@ tive or in@@ hib@@ itions or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with be careful when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ men@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r @-@ Exposition like adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than of the capsules ; therefore A@@ men@@ ase Solution and A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function should be low on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this schem@@ atics compar@@ ably lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ di@@ aries with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne @-@ cell@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ ome in dos@@ ages to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of the people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the cell @-@ cell membran@@ es and carcin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , little evidence for the adoption of clinical relev@@ ance of these findings from the present @-@ positioning data on humans , both of clinical studies and therapeutic purposes . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ations test in human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , nor after the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity treated at young , who were treated from an age of 4 , showed both high mortality and with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; however , in a systemic plasma exposure that was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ level skel@@ etal changes were observed . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ men@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ pr@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied daily . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ men@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous use , patients with weak or light liver function should be done with caution in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ men@@ ase should be set on duration 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increased , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max . if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained in the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will not be well @-@ known as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ ing of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ mo@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .
&quot; when this drug is applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rology surveillance should be made , as an exact predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ver@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ Gener@@ ase will be required to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ ver@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is present . &quot;
&quot; the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , pin pin , ni@@ f@@ pin , ni@@ f@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , which may potentially increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medication . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days were decreased , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fic@@ t@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of increasing or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful abor@@ tion of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the after@@ math . &quot;
the in@@ tox@@ icity of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of an overdose symptoms , the patient must observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) if required , are necessary supporting measures necessary . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood cells . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered for the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active inventory during the dos@@ ing @-@ state concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range from C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines containing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be induc@@ tive or in@@ hib@@ itions or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with be careful when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function should be low on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the edge of mice with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne @-@ cell@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ ome in doses of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of the people following a daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the ro@@ o@@ idal metast@@ asis and carcin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , little evidence for the adoption of clinical relev@@ ance of these findings from the present ex@@ position data on humans , both of clinical trials and therapeutic use . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ations test in human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity treated at young , who were treated from an age of 4 , showed both high mortality and with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in young the metabol@@ ites are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ men@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to insert ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ vent@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there must be no dose recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ vent@@ ase solution to insert and low do@@ si@@ sted k@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase can be contra@@ cted to patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene glyco@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ cted for infants and children under 4 years , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like heart rhyth@@ mic problems ( z .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy did not lead to healing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ast@@ er@@ ase prevents risk 47 of a transmission of HIV on others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .

&quot; when a dose is dropped , the patient so@@ aked the cream as soon as he / she not@@ ices this and then continue with the usual treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is coated in a thin layer and to drive into the ger@@ st@@ ated skin area , until the cream is fully assembled . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should be carried out between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; it should be eff@@ lu@@ ent in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and with a possible organ@@ ic@@ tion or Gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies in which no daily occurr@@ ence was carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is and one case was observed with one of the leading Stri@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended dos@@ ages , an elevated risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed in cases of severe local skin irrit@@ ations that have a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties in the water , which required a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous funds for the treatment of external com@@ bu@@ ces in the genital and peri@@ odic range , no clinical experiences have yet been found . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicate an increased rate of income reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the elim@@ ination of the incl@@ ines , however , showed less@@ er efficacy . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair rate was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take down in general during therapy or reactions to the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if due to the problems of patients or due to the sever@@ ity of local hood actions , a treat of several days can be made . &quot;
the clinical outcome of therapy can be judged after the treatment of treated skin after 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , super@@ nat@@ al cell carcin@@ oma should be drawn into consideration for super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences , therefore the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors are not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy exists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears , or at the lip@@ stick area within the Lip Aug@@ mentation . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ical places outside the facial and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application purpose , therefore a such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions take usually in the course of intensity in intensity or go back after the use of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if local skin reactions cause large un@@ eas@@ iness or very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acute les@@ ions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ og@@ ative treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ al development that emerged from the binding or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after embar@@ rass@@ ing even after several top@@ ical application , ser@@ um@@ able serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be reached , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding time . &quot;
the most frequently shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in connection side effects in the studies with three weeks of overall treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most frequently reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated Bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported adverse events .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in the context of the in@@ effect were a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) . &quot;
the side effects that were evaluated by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis were listed below .
&quot; according to the investig@@ ative assessment of clinical signs , this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often indicates local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion / leaves ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ative assessment of clinical signs , clinical evidence shows that it was very frequent in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ int@@ od @-@ Creme very often to severe ery@@ themes ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and severe sch@@ or@@ ating and em@@ bo@@ ating ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ advert@@ ise unique oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gies and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized to oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected on the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in 3 appro@@ vals Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete suspension of in@@ dol@@ ences for 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior . &quot;
&quot; for 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients , the in@@ ject was complete ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete allocation could be achieved in 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for five consecutive application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically advanced bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , in@@ controlled @-@ term study after four years present data shows that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically maintained and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has three weeks of use in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ treated @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic Ak@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 of large treatment area than on an un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the year @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical assignment .
&quot; the approved indications that are in@@ adequate , ac@@ ular ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fic@@ ate bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur in pairs of pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients generally not investigated and were therefore not examined . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ int@@ od was not shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimum systemic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived 0,1 , 0,2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the use in the face ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the arms / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hrs half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
data on the systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after top@@ ical application was low in the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; one also yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse in four months . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice during three days per week induced no tum@@ ors on the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk for people due to the systemic exposure than very low . &quot;
the tum@@ ors were treated in mice group who was treated with the real @-@ free cream before and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated primarily , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by its effect relating to reducing the G@@ ag concentration in urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ ag concentration in urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children demonstrated a normal large liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are higher blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ y@@ kar@@ ens ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react sensiti@@ vely to patients who react sensiti@@ vely to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , or any other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be announced every year any new information which may be known to check and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to make a approval for the distribution of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster , ov@@ ine of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed for patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h for every 15 minutes .
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions which are defined as each in relation to the in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , these patients should also be monitored continuously , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies are expected against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution in use of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the recovery of the treatment after a longer interru@@ ption , risk provision@@ ing must be c@@ auti@@ ous due to an interru@@ ption of treatment after an interru@@ ption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ tic@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potentially occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ serious reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol should be weighed and / or reduced in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused to decrease anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; 3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the previous reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies does not allow to direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data in new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated compared to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase above the breast milk , is recommended , during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion reactions , with 53 % of the patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed . &quot;
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the phase 3 study and of its extension at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some cases with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the previous history , heavy reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory system and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , reported mainly a serious delay form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment of a nap@@ ok@@ on@@ version , whereby it occurred in patients at the age of 5 usually with a severe offset form ( on average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients did not have been shown by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ repar@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients , with whom it has never been at Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with a lack of low antibodies . a robust reduction in the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n , whereas in patients with high antibodies tit@@ res was a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ale to low neutr@@ alizing activity on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ ide activity in vitro that seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired drugs even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse drug inter@@ actions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enzyme treatment is located in one for the hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ats and the preventing of another accumulation of enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase will be removed quickly from the cycle and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely above Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of the patients was rejected by the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient rejected the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recruited , when they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the anticipated value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients to improve the lung function and the ability to improve the treatment in the following table . &quot;
an improvement in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant above these period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung volume increases further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with an hepat@@ atomic fact prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was found constant until the study remained constant .
&quot; in regard to the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who was taken into account through using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined at 20 patients at the time of their recording in the study ( 16 patients with serious delay form and 4 with medium stroke shape ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several cases , a magn@@ um growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was observed after the Z @-@ score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ run form rejected a normal spiritual development rate , whereas only limited or not progress in cogn@@ itive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into the co@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata was carried out on the g@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can be treated with patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug should be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to the patients with older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on the Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity in a repeat@@ able gift and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data can recognize no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; since no toler@@ ances studies were carried out , this medicine should not be mixed with other medicines except those under 6.@@ 6th . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C unless the di@@ lution under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions were carried out . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the approval for the per@@ imeter has given the following study program which results the basis for the annual evaluation report to the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will cause long @-@ term security and efficacy information about patients who have been treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data for the natural pro@@ gre@@ di@@ ence of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , is a certain substances in the body ( Gly@@ cos@@ amine o@@ glyceri@@ des ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic ( excessive ) to one of the components of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion reaction is any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible ) . &quot;
&quot; applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you contain medicines containing chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ c@@ ain , because a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;

hints for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate on the production of a in@@ fusion solution needs to be dil@@ uted before application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some cases with serious M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the previous history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory system and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( appearance of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ rö@@ der • higher oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the packing unit will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C unless the di@@ lution under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions were carried out . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone ( drugs against cancer ) and mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( from an operation alone can &apos;t be removed ) and mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ium cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have not been treated before , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than all of the therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce adverse events , patients should benefit from vitamin B12 in the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta as well as folic acid ( vitamin ) and vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition to the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition to an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drugs against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid man@@ ure ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood were changed , or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be lowered or reduced the dose . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed thus the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form goes easier to static cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medicines and a longer period of effect in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant end@@ othel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study on 456 patients who previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer have been compared to the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy effects ( a different drug against cancer ) .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicines for cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy first @-@ term survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies , patients who did not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ium cells during administration of A@@ lim@@ ta long survival times than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission adopted Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to provide a approval for the distribution of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each bottle bottle must be dissolved with 4,2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the bottle bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in displayed on first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for super@@ don@@ or epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except in spite of thought @-@ to @-@ rotation epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
a reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as per day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given .
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and in@@ gest@@ ion must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ root dose and after every third act cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a Dos@@ age examination must take place under the Note of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asting . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , the patients must be treated according to the instructions in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 1 degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient needs to be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient needs the value in front of the treatment &quot;
&quot; treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled , if in patients after 2 dose of dose , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ lic@@ - continued at the occurr@@ ence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity . &quot;
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or in comparison to patients in the age of 65 years an elevated side effect i@@ - ko exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on un@@ question@@ ing and effectiveness .
clinical studies were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min . no dose adjustment needed for all patients recommended Dos@@ age adap@@ t@@ ations .
the data conditions in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of &gt; to the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; to the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored in relation to the Kno@@ wing gum disease and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be given to patients a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ c@@ cy@@ tes reaches a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as Neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutr@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutr@@ rop@@ enia was given if a treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients need to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as the proph@@ yl@@ tic intervention in reducing tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ ster@@ oids and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is intended to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDS with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients with whom these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid gathering , a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ sion is expected to be weighed in pre @-@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ ral mal@@ icious events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed live oil ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ cep@@ ted ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shafts that consists of reproductive @-@ capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out of the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted , advice on the sperm vation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oids ( ≥ 1.3 grams per day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ root privileg@@ es with the result of a decrease of adverse events . &quot;
&quot; therefore , be careful when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDS or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , at least 2 days prior to therapy , therapy and reduction ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data regarding the inter@@ actions with N@@ SA@@ IDS with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy . &quot;
the big in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the disease status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ions and ant@@ ine@@ es@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia .
&quot; there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed at pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected in the pregnancy heavy birth defects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily , demanding and after careful abor@@ tion of usage for the mother and risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shafts that consists of reproductive @-@ capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , advice on the sperm cells . &quot;
&quot; it is not known , whether pec@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in breast milk and un@@ wanted effects can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ col@@ i@@ om , and the random@@ ized c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and held 163 patients with Mes@@ col@@ i@@ om , randomised C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ enn@@ oplast@@ y anti @-@ fol@@ ate , which breaks its effect by lifting effect , which are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as anti@@ fol@@ ate acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple attack factors ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ vi@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) and the fol@@ li@@ gible key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ me and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des are blocked .

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the examination in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement in clinical relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant end@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were caused by improving the pul@@ mon@@ ary parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the time of control .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open phase III study involving AL@@ IM@@ TA to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology at the treatment effect on overall survival fell to the overall survival of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with NS@@ CL@@ C with a predominantly non @-@ hard epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a separate randomised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ le@@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .
&quot; mean PFS was 4.8 months for combination with gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( customized HR = 1,@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 3@@ 3.9 ) for the combination of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in compared to 28,@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; analysis of influence of NS@@ CL@@ C hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant under@@ - le@@ aning in the hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;

the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed according to gift as mon@@ otherap@@ eutic were examined at 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - on a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly unchanged in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the prescribed dose is found unchanged within 24 hours after the application remain in urine .

&quot; these enzymes become in@@ hib@@ ited , they can &apos;t shed some fats in the food , thus making about a quarter of the fats that resulted in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , 3@@ 91 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 was compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who recorded a average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ ed by after , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair crisis , chair crisis , fet@@ ched / o@@ gens chair , ling@@ ering / oils ( drums ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( preventing transplan@@ ting patients ) or drugs such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ low syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) suffer from digestive tract infections or in Chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) and with pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .

all@@ i can be used to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical and fet@@ al @-@ duc@@ ed diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are no sufficient data on the efficacy and safety .
&quot; however or@@ list@@ at only is minimal , however , is necessary for elderly and / or kidney function in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;

the probability of superior gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be carried out with an improved metabolic control , patients who consult a medicine with all@@ i to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic medication should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels , should consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dose of this drug must be adapted . &quot;
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevent the contra@@ cep@@ tive contra@@ cep@@ tive action in the event of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with the same application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bars .
&quot; in combination with or@@ list@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K remained in the norm range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be recommended prior to bed@@ time a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amine to ensure a sufficient amount of vitality ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a disposable dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , at a limited number of volunteers , received or@@ list@@ at the same time Or@@ list@@ at received a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect impacts on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , since the absorption of in@@ correct fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials involving Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data available ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side effects , which were detected after the or@@ list@@ at market is not known , because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
+ It is pl@@ au@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to se@@ duc@@ ts with regard to potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered three times a day over a period of 15 days , without the significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; at the majority of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at @-@ exagger@@ ation cases , either side effects or similar effects were reported as the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on a research on human and animal , a rapid response , systematic response from or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed to be derived from or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of stomach and upper intest@@ ine due to co@@ valent bonds to the active serv@@ o rest of gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies was derived from clinical trials , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ ch is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 show the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ chlor@@ ic and fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall le@@ vy was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

the most common side effects depend on the mode of operation along with the mode of operation and generate fat out of the body .
&quot; these side effects occur usually within the first weeks after the start of treatment , as you may have reduced the fat content in diet perhaps not consistently . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ize the nutrition @-@ related problems : • Beg@@ in already some days , or better a week , before the first intake of your favorite foods and over the size of the portions you usually take to themselves . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you see from leaving your fat limit . • Do your recommended fatty amount evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; do not save the amount of calories and fat that you may take to themselves in the form of a low @-@ fat main court or a long @-@ standing night plan , as you may occur in other programs for weight reduction , learn this with the time by adjust@@ ing their diet . &quot;
&quot; • Use your medicines for children un@@ condition@@ ally . • You must not apply all@@ i according to the request of the exp@@ iry date . • The bottle has been closed down to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;
if you do not swal@@ low this on any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) with which this pack is enclosed .

overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk of emergence of various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes Care • Det@@ ection • Det@@ ective canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for this disease .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals , which contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed permanently healthy . &quot;
energy is also measured in Kil@@ o@@ j@@ oule where you can also find out as an indication on the pack@@ ag@@ ings of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake will take you how many calories you should take a maximum of each day .
&quot; note the below in this section of the tables . • The recommended fatty intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with every meal . &quot;
&quot; which amount is suitable for you , take the information below that is the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Up@@ on the mode of operation of the capsule is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat like so far , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by compliance with the recommended fatty intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and decreased the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood for mal@@ ici@@ encies . • you should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight of 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn daily 150 kcal per day , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to put your realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat targets , and to keep them also . • T@@ ry to move a nutrition journal with details to cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start all@@ i . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
&quot; the use in patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient avo@@ ids a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , showed 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 von 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , showed 81 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy alone ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ li@@ mp@@ ing , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically ne@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is advis@@ able with the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that are incl@@ ined to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi shall neither be used to treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited tum@@ ours against tum@@ ours of the five chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; in a population based on a population based phar@@ ma @-@ genetic analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ ine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , bach@@ elor and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; no experiences relating to the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t lie before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied to pregnant women than necessary . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common effects were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who might have stood at least with Alo@@ xi in connection , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reactions and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar subjects were able to observe adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose of action to observe . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the great distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - survi@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 , were compared with patients who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , that was administered on day 1 without the exam@@ in@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine received 250 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ os@@ et@@ ron , who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron who were given 1 intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the study with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameter , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block companies involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and the duration of the action . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; reset . after intraven@@ ous gift , a slow elim@@ ination of Plas@@ ma@@ concentrate follows a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average harvest half of about 40 hours . &quot;
&quot; the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg , in the entire dose of dos@@ ages and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; according to the intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average age ranged between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; due to a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 75 mg of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to a monthly intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies for met@@ abol@@ ism , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in a lower measure that are involved in the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 met@@ abol@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were found in the Ur@@ in Ur@@ in , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ al projection , the total cells was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function interfer@@ es in patients with severe liver function and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which points to a minor relev@@ ance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of these clinical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block at very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als which can be involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and the action of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ent@@ ails in about 30 times of the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in a prolifer@@ ating incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ates , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not entirely known , but due to the high doses of high doses and da Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , relev@@ ance of these results will be considered low for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion on the approval of the approval of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C using Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which should be similar to the same practice , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) Hepatitis C ( one caused by infectious liver disease ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue has damage , and also the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ gled amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in the blood standard . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was transferred to the formation of the drug .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data , which prove the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( effect structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety , and efficacy ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to the effectiveness of the reference team by 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus found in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business processors . what were the biggest concerns about the CH@@ MP recommendation to send the approval for the market ?
&quot; in addition , concerns expressed that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the marketing of drugs . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which said to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease increased in more patients than at the reference drug ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side @-@ side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was asked to study the question , to what extent the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequate . &quot;
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a cr@@ ust @-@ formation of skin infection ) and small in@@ infected in@@ firm@@ ities ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for the treatment of infections that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ clin@@ ically stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this kind of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface cannot be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond after two to three days , the doctor should re @-@ examine the patient and draw alternative treatments into consideration . &quot;
it works through blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection remained after the end of treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients suffering from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo said to the treatment .
Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin @-@ customers , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were taken to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was induced in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ ful hol@@ low rooms in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the contractor .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on short @-@ term treatment of superf@@ icial skin infections remained over the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ under@@ ations , sets or paraly@@ sed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the patients , where there is no improvement in two to three days , should be examined once again and an alternative therapy may be considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a sensiti@@ zation or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment should be carefully caught and an adequate alternative therapy of infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections in which M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in clinical trials was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered as if after 2 @-@ 3 days of treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected position occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plasma concentration , which were reached in humans following top@@ ical application on the skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the small systemic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reprodu@@ ci@@ bility after oral intake and in@@ adequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the rub@@ ella / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an systemic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / terminated , is between the benefit of the silent lens for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go Therap@@ y for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2,@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported b@@ ov@@ ation at the appointment site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of mode of operation in Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , a substance that is isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding point of the 50s @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes that diff@@ ers from the bin@@ aries of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ r@@ ative anti@@ bacterial substances .
data show that the bin@@ s of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P Bin@@ der@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .
&quot; by li@@ aison to this bin@@ der , hem@@ ophi@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block some P binding on inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local prevalence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infectious forms , a consultation by experts should be targeted . &quot;
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the ins@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
&quot; in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was opened daily under Oc@@ clu@@ sion and on deported skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling rate took place 3 or 4 in adult patients each before medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake was reduced by 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or . &quot;

&quot; ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases , which affect the liver ) in children between a age of 15 and 15 years , which are not yet immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied in the context of a two doses of the vacc@@ ines , with a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached by appointment in the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and ensured that the vaccine can be led out of two doses existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if a response rate against hepatitis A or B can be desired , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; cause vacc@@ ines effect by the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against illness . &quot;
&quot; once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix includes the same components as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , has been approved by Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protecting the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix Children are given to an existing vaccination schedule . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are identical to identical ingredients , some of the data which supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ ct@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of vacc@@ ines was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambi@@ rix was between 98 and 100 % of ger@@ minated children one month after the last injection of developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a sixth and a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , redness , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix may not react sensiti@@ vely to patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a permit for the distribution of Ambi@@ rix in the entire &quot;
&quot; the standard dim@@ entation plan for the ground di@@ mm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a susp@@ ect is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination @-@ bodied . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ hal@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size , as according to the vaccination with the particular mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ ologic individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis B vaccine , as they may also need to be protected as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ sim@@ ulations , the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction should be available immediately after the patient &apos;s gift , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standard dim@@ mer scheme is recommended to include the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with distur@@ ban@@ ces in the immune system , an adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies can be achieved so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal stimul@@ us , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood ger@@ inner disorders , ambi@@ rix can be in@@ jected sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases , as in these cases it can come to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of a separate injection was administered simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us immune vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ o@@ dys@@ res@@ si@@ ver therapy or patients with immune defects have to be assumed that the immune response is likely to be achieved .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted using 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ness , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ hal@@ o@@ idal vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ness at a calculation basis per vaccination daily Ambi@@ rix , but not at a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.8 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix was given to pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ern@@ ity was comparable high ( i.e. , over the whole vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans combination fuel ) . &quot;
the frequency of distinctive pain and matrix was small and comparable to the combination of the combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccination scheme .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that in administration with a 3@@ ELISA units of formal hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per volume . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans @-@ vaccination schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface , was statistically significant . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials , which were carried out at the age of 1 to including 15 years , were the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was ext@@ end@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of 3 @-@ dose regim@@ es significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which in a clinical study study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds were reached a month after the end of the full vacc@@ ines ( i.e. in the month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ inated with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg of combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
&quot; for individuals who were at the time of the ground attack between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies were detected above at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the immune reaction against both antibodies was comparable to both anti@@ gens , consisting of a combination of 360 ELISA units formed with a combination of 360 ELISA units and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
&quot; when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ us , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation similar to op@@ rot@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be investigated both before and after res@@ us@@ al exposure to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ us@@ cit@@ ric food and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in the waters of contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms possibly necessary for stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect completely before an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child in front of the administration of both vaccination doses have already been infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , ( although you / your child does not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
&quot; protection against other infections that may cause the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; • If your child is already an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction may be an allergic reaction to an earlier in@@ oc@@ ulation against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier in@@ oc@@ ulation against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccination ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; the second vaccination dose of this vaccine , with reduced levels of effective stock , is usually given a month after the first dose , and should give you a vaccination protection before the vaccination of vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , ambi@@ rix are suffering from heavy bleeding problems under the skin and not in muscle tissues . • If you are weak@@ ened / her child due to a disease or a treatment in your body &apos;s own defense , or if you / her child is subjected to a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is required . &quot;
21 Sub@@ way you to your doctor if you / your child will take any further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given or that in the near future is planned .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible different lim@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be enough . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix fluctu@@ ations or l@@ act@@ ating women are not administered unless it is urg@@ ently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as the hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you / your child already showed an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has become known for the first approval of the market since the division of the first approval of the market , the CH@@ MP was positive that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix only was placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to small patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with a complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( cereb@@ ral injury due to high concentrations of ammon@@ ium ) .
ammon@@ aps is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed , mixed with the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal ceiling in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose in leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; there was no compar@@ ative study , because ammon@@ i@@ fication could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a p@@ seu@@ do@@ medicine , that means no active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ i@@ fication can also cause loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid disorders , skin pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or , or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ aps in patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle are effective to high concentrations of ammon@@ ium . &quot;
ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the disease of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
&quot; the use is inde@@ xed with all patients , where a complete enzyme level has already manifested in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ firm form ( in@@ full enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first lifetime ) is an indication of use when in the history of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of protein tolerance and , for growth , and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early firm lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ric surgery or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an arg@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ amine deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets do not arrive immediately in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ structive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and de@@ formation of clinical assignment only with caution . &quot;
&quot; because Met@@ abol@@ ism and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ cted ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal distribution and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral sy@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic divor@@ ced in humans in breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ cted during breast@@ feeding times ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had an undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ ired events was assumed that they did not stand with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a metabolic rate of metabolic disorders , severe Hy@@ po@@ d@@ ie , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an overdose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old small child with a single @-@ sigh@@ ted single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate that showed an dos@@ ing dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is an metabolic combination that con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ulation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is divor@@ ced over the kidneys .
&quot; Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; it is of importance that the diagnosis is early , and the treatment is immediately begun to improve survival opportunities and clinical results . &quot;
&quot; the forecast of the earliest appearance of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease even led to the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first life year . &quot;
&quot; due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of neu@@ tered in post @-@ part@@ al ( however , within the first lifetime ) of diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was 100 % but even in these patients with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ firm form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ hic form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ ran@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase defect ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ matic with glut@@ amine ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ar , after single and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were also examined in cancer patients following an intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bi@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in plasma during the next morning . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three individual doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at@@ concentrations in the plasma concentration in the third day were five times higher than according to the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; the drug is divor@@ ced within 24 hours , about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine concerning the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the normal area . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early firm lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ric surgery or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when R@@ atten@@ dees had been abandoned before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ane ( active met@@ abo@@ o of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of the brain cells . &quot;
&quot; an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a metabolic rate of metabolic disorders , severe Hy@@ po@@ d@@ ie , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ar in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication through a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that it cannot be able to separate the nit@@ ric waste products that can &apos;t be put away after consumption of proteins . &quot;
&quot; if there are laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine should go over the breast milk and hurt your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste problems , im@@ itation of hearing , des@@ ori@@ enti@@ veness , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces , and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; when you find one of these symptoms , get immediately with your doctor or emergency recording of your hospital for purpose in conjunction with a corresponding treatment . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast basket with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart failure ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( an abnormal measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ dio@@ gram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who submit to a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients suffering from ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; almost 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of angi@@ ox or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and an GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ ter@@ ia to prevent cl@@ asp ) , and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who under@@ go a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ ine , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more efficient than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine , or other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in patients who recently had an bleeding , as well as with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart rate . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission adopted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval for the distribution of an@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ do ) ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in further episode a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased , and the in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an initial intraven@@ ous inc@@ in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed and administered rapidly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be used and the ACT will restart 5 minutes after the second bolt of Bol@@ us@@ . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which included in the approval was the ACT value 5 minutes following the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Bol@@ us without a dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ cted to contra@@ diction ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be carried out 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous action of un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous substance of low @-@ molecular hepat@@ ocy@@ tes .
• popular hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the substance or other components or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or higher risk of bleeding due to an disorder of hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial En@@ do@@ kar@@ dit@@ is . • heavier kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; the patients are carefully controlled during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture can occur in patients who occur to an per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Standards &#91; ratio ) should be drawn into consideration that the value after putting the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again reached the treatment existing prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , this molecular entities can increase the risk of blood pressure . &quot;
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in each case regularly .
&quot; the animal experiments are in@@ adequate in terms of the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post @-@ nat@@ al development insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone ; 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the group @-@ treated compar@@ ative groups , women and patients with more than 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
heavy bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measure for heavy bleeding as in the notes of Table 2 .
both slight and severe bleeding among bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ expression plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ oral , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or blood pressure required , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter of ≥ 5 g / dl without obvious bleeding point , re@@ operation of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to blood flow , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ alis@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ations , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ aches , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical study involving Bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients , who under@@ go a PCI . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the group @-@ treated compar@@ ative groups , women and patients with more than 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding emerged in significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; following side effects that are not listed above , were reported following comprehensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organs in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is immediately breaking down and the patient eng@@ th@@ ed to monitor signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ar which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as the anim@@ osity region of Th@@ rom@@ bin , regardless of whether Th@@ rom@@ bin is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ rom@@ bin , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ rom@@ bin joined the li@@ aison of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , whereby the function of the active centre of Th@@ rom@@ bin re@@ generated . &quot;
&quot; in addition , by bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients , in which it had come to he@@ at@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregate reaction . &quot;

&quot; if a PCI was conducted in the following patients , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be increased and the in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
in the arm A the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lever ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk factors , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent Isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of patients under@@ gone a angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) to the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease , in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control the glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or insulin cannot be effective . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very low of human insulin , and the change means it seems faster and a shorter effect time has a short @-@ acting human@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body can &apos;t work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indi@@ ct@@ ator for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined by a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human@@ oid normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can effect on the blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Germany GmbH to provide a approval for the distribution of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is available as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal muscles .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin resistance , the insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the actual strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can withdraw a change in insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dose or fail@@ ing of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ one ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
&quot; the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type , or an ins@@ ure in another manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage necessary . &quot;
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the profile of the insulin treatment and can therefore change to change the schem@@ atic .
&quot; the substances that enhance blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ phs , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ ine @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , al@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ gen will be weak@@ ened or are missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive sto@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ suffici@@ ency ling@@ ul@@ ism and human@@ ism in relation to the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin milk occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin doesn &apos;t occur in the mother &apos;s milk , it is absorbed by oral surgery . &quot;
&quot; below are the results of clinical trials listed , group@@ ed according to system organic classes and arranged according to the incidence of their occurr@@ ence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ;

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy Is missed to change the injection site within the injection of injec@@ tions can occur in the sequence of a Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy on the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ phs with consciousness can be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a physician to be treated by glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a Glu@@ c@@ agon@@ ism , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ - cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be driven by ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the action time is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal levels .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes , the insulin @-@ relevant met@@ ering range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a propor@@ tion@@ propor@@ tion@@ ed glu@@ ing effect , and at 0,3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase in the glu@@ eing effect , exactly like human@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect , such as normal human@@ ism and achieves a full glu@@ es effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the data was evident that with an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ oid normal insulin which will be given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; the insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was harvested , a better post @-@ den@@ den@@ ial control was given in 2 minutes before the meal was achieved . &quot;
&quot; insulin is given in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control such as human normal @-@ insulin is given ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in gift 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) before the beginning of the meal , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) before a meal was given ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - down@@ ward ) after the beginning of the meal , compared to human@@ oid mal@@ ign@@ an@@ ism , which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) . &quot;
