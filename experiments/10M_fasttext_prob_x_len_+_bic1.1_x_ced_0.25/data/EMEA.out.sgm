<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), failure and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder, in which patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal heart rate) alternately alternate with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the treatment, Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who responded to the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used to use or the melt tablets in patients who prepares the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who use other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to enable the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin is playing a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, eliminating psychotic or manian symptoms and their re-occur."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the symptoms of the symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study carried out the efficacy of Abilify and placebo in another study compared to 160 patients, where the manian symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injectionsolution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that had been compared to placebo (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets, and the solution for inclusion."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, received significantly greater reduction in symptoms that received placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the use of the bipolar disorder, Abilify was less than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks. in addition, placebo prevented the re-appear episden in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased more effective than placebo in the symptoms and were similarly effective like Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extracellular dysfunctions (drowsiness), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), obstipation (drowsiness), nausea and exhaustion, restlessness, insomite (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanism (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify believed in treating schizophrenia and of medium-serious episodes of patients who were mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol said to the risks convinced.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injectioning solution in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes of bipolar disorder, if an oral therapy is not appropriate compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the distribution of Abilify in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe manian episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode of patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased efficacy in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day independently of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">ABILIFY effectiveness in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients at least 65 years was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are clear (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of successive behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after switching to an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased suicides risk with Aripiprazol was compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, failure disorders), cerebral malignant diseases (dehydration disorders, treatment with hemortive drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dysentinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole dyskinesia."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when an ABILIFY treated signs and symptoms of an Late dyskinetry, the dose should be drawn into consideration, reduce the dose or to break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be set."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be applied in patients with seizures in the Anamination or conditions that are in connection with seizures."</seg>

<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixer dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted fragile events with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazione or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including ABILIFY."</seg>

<seg id="46">"polythpher, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"generally, a weight gain is generally known in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain was observed as side effect, and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers an highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to be expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have to be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">The CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolites can result in higher plasma concentration of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensively.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose of the companion therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or esitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with ABILIFY together with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol have no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylan / 3-methodxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin) and 3A4 (dextromethorphic)."</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data security in the human being and due to which in the reproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"the CPK (Kreatin-Phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients with Aripiprazol patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"in relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptan syndrome, late dyskinetry and seizures, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional transitions with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hemoggy with Aripiprazol, however, it is unlikely that hematalysis in the treatment of a surviation benefit is, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol is suspected in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptor and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for Dopamine D4- and 5HT2c- and 5HT2c- and 5HT7- to alpha-1-adrengen and to the histamine-receptor.</seg>

<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychological symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a week 52, 52% of the patients (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%) was similar in a Haloperidol-controlled study, in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study games, including PANSS and the Montgomery Assign- depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in reverse rate, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in a lanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly less patients with a minimum increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e., an increase of at least 5.6 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, with a flexible dose of more than 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fictally or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placeboarding and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to placebo or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on how lithium or semi-opidol.</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Humanism (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion on the approval of the approval of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C using Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon is a biological drug called Roferon-A, which should be similar to the same practice, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference drug" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) Hepatitis C (one caused by infectious liver disease).</seg>

<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was transferred to the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon presented data, which prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (effect structure, composition, and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety, and efficacy)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference team by 455 patients."</seg>

<seg id="2670">"the number of patients with hepatitis C, which said to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increased in more patients than at the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side-side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from that, the test was asked to study the question, to what extent the drug forms a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine), not adequate."</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a crust-formation of skin infection) and small ininfected infirmities (Riss- or chives).</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for the treatment of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by methicillinclinically staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface cannot be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond after two to three days, the doctor should re-examine the patient and draw alternative treatments into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients suffering from Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo said to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin-customers, about 90% of the patients of both groups were taken to the treatment. "</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was induced in the treatment of abscesses (eitful hollow rooms in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven or probably by MRSA, is not effective enough."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation on the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Humanism (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo on short-term treatment of superficial skin infections remained over the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small launderations, sets or paralysed wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the distribution of Altargo in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the patients, where there is no improvement in two to three days, should be examined once again and an alternative therapy may be considered (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin salbe, the treatment should be carefully caught and an adequate alternative therapy of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding point of the 50s-unit of the bacterial Ribosomes that differs from the binaries of other ribosomal interagrative antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data show that the bins of ribosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P Binderstelle and the Peptidyltransferring centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by liaison to this binder, hemophiromutiline block the peptidyltransfer, block some P binding on interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin should appear at least some infectious forms, a consultation by experts should be targeted."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity from Retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the insates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-appealing treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) to the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease, in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control the glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or insulin cannot be effective."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very low of human insulin, and the change means it seems faster and a shorter effect time has a short-acting humanist."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was examined in combination with a long-effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body can't work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indictator for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycemic hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined by a reduction of 0.14% in insulin-lisper."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in humanoid normal."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra must not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra must be adjusted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines, which can effect on the blood glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH to provide a approval for the distribution of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is available as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and the diminished insulin resistance, the insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the actual strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinc delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can withdraw a change in insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dose or failing of treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoazione; these states are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"the changeover of a patient on another insulin type, or an insure in another manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the profile of the insulin treatment and can therefore change to change the schematic.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that enhance blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglyphs, include oral antidiabetics, angiotensine-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyphen, alalizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics."</seg>
