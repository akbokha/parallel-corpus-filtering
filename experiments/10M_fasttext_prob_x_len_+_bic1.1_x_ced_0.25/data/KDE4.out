the package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by providing this easier .
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you can find in the manual &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings of enh@@ ancements .... Open the card tools and select the required modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the K@@ DE ; add @-@ ons . please note that possibly more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras stor@@ my . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash if present , delete the list . &quot;
the att@@ endant filter ( also called the folder filter ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ pressing noise filter . with the module you can filter and con@@ quer@@ or ; a current directory of different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display begins with the root copy of the document , example : elements , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for different symbols and text resources to view the contents of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is there to depic@@ t folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree Map . every object is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object small or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . according to this way , large files can be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hier@@ archy . according to this way , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle that represents a file or a file in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the right corner has a sensible color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rectangle , which is switched over view of color mode , can be either a depth for the easy detection of the scre@@ enings or picture of another file @-@ alone such as name , owners , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can define whether they are displayed at all , or if there is enough space for displaying the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . additionally , you can design@@ ate the relative position of labelling in rectangle . &quot;
&quot; in case algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should generally keep the area proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always available . there will be a frame , which will then get the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries for the frame , if the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as to split the surface of an entry to the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left . here it is necessary for labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to the requirements that are available as possible . the best methods of that are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second healing . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal space for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a pattern sample is drawn in the area of the revised entry to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ get designed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d application . &quot;

&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can click on the crossed arrows . to hold the visible range of the image , you must click here and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode , both pictures show the same image range . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom control under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad to zoom into the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word - away from the process of the process after the image has been taken up until the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos will be sc@@ anned or digital photos ab@@ uses a form of digital data management . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips such as you can find , protect , protect and photos . we look forward to the procedure for digital photographs the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f . we consider how to use , configure , verify , evaluate , verify , verify , verify , waiting , waiting , and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secu@@ res , secu@@ res , transformed , and exported content to the one monetary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I agree to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find any data management longer a certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; . the approach the met@@ ad@@ ata can also use very fast search and secure archives on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know before you want to maintain something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide if you want to store your computer , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network / etc ; please note that you need to switch on a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found fast on your memory location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then you can print a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not be able to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to be able to activate the met@@ ad@@ ata page in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file by selecting the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database by selecting the appropriate item in the menu .
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes are available . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should select each photo keywords , fittings and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that you will need the same attribute and then start the value . this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with key@@ word , keys , how to proceed with other programs often , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalog@@ u@@ ised images from another source , then , &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; automatically put the tree to the right spot . automatically det@@ on@@ ment of the hier@@ archy within the building is not a problem and can easily be handled by using a sub@@ bau@@ d to another . the changed keywords are pursued by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; updated during the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata shows up . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data can be found . &quot;
&quot; enough keywords - the next section refers to rel@@ ays or comments , the third important tool to catalog@@ u@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; most don &apos;t let you want to see your photos easily , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then begin to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this the landing field of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical period of time is present , you may even hear the silence . the labels has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others , the title may look more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to understand the meaning of the viewer that you can understand what you understand . &quot;
it &apos;s ok if a picture is not perfect if the strength only has a label for itself .
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze , you can store a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE can even export it to your wishes in the labelling and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system . so , you will have to tell you the story for opening hours . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now goes with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can already be we@@ en@@ sible and can be closer in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future you can also download your journeys with goo@@ gle@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms apply also in all modified versions , i.e. also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; as information should be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for Er@@ ist and Writ@@ ers ) : this field should be used for your name , or the name of the person who has created the photograph , for example , if it is not desired to be saved , the name of a company or organization should not be changed . this field is supported neither comm@@ ot@@ ons nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ol@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for Constitu@@ ent ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the name of the photographer . examples for this can be titles , free professional photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a focus on the author field , this is also to be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor ( Syn@@ onym for Con@@ tractor ) : use the An@@ bi@@ dder field to identify the photo . if the photographer has been listed here , these organizations can be listed here , which you can &apos;t offer the picture below . if the picture is a picture photo , then the picture / agency is the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans ; will provide a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : record error , record fail@@ ures , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disin@@ teg@@ ration , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions &quot;
&quot; of course , we are not talking about CDs that have lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen at traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest database production company , has some interesting statistics that has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer than a few years . of course , you can claim CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course , you can claim any more expensive and much more expensive . there are also offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece set up a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you think it is in your measurement room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can reduce good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and make them a lot more reliable than the cheapest , but you have much reliable . it &apos;s about to choose the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors , even if you just have just been written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection against moisture , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a favourable program named I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster this apparently miracle in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that was said to CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; slowly burn with a good recording device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . after that , you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author label and then on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget to read the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers control include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives at this topic : dis@@ ap@@ points &quot;
&quot; soon : Dis@@ ks keep the longest when you run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In low temperature control , SM@@ ART can not determine this error . some of SM@@ ART is the most common error correction . these are particularly read@@ est and publishing counter . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power supply before you have secured the files , but these losses are usually able to recover without big problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment can not make a lot of electricity , that can cause serious damage with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage , hardware age , and other defects . protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against electric tips is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat , and it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , you don &apos;t think every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage prot@@ ector , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects protection against lighten@@ ing lightning and protect the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used on your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ als are also connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage for your modem . others provide connection possibilities for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode and TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for on the road . &quot;
&quot; while a over@@ voltage protection is protected your system in front of smaller variations in the electricity lines , it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to loss of adverse events . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can provide automatic battery @-@ energy if a power loss occurs . some models allow them to store up to the river . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure to get the same quality requirements such as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed , and compare its safety at rapi@@ ds with the cost of avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think as well as your computer can be protected . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you arrive in the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as backup target for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data about the compar@@ atively long @-@ term internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to you . the professional variant gives you more available , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ a year you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transfer error will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and include the large firms in the offer a backup and a partial memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system radi@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least secure the data integral between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says if you have occurred in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have been destroyed by one day . no one seems to be thought to have a protection . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable networks are another source for transfers , as they generate inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal file systems this error remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you &apos;ll see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates , which can deal with record lack at low level and can be scal@@ able under one to the GP@@ L compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms using it and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not part of the core .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook , and 46 % at work@@ load systems . if not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % . &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most people think . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer sigh@@ ted long ago .
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems avoid corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and a defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main cause of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and space characteristics are not far from this border from this border .
today &apos;s cameras walk towards the 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteri@@ or@@ ating . even DS@@ LR cameras have a high @-@ quality look at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xels . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other responsible for data loss . thus , your data is often affected by one data loss . thus , your data is often affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous like the re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected in the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster beats locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and theft , are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ion always means not a local storage . bring up your steps up the stairs into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above , a common reason for a loss of data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup , that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a moment@@ um without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete protection . this creates a complete moment of two periods : the complete recovery and the last differential .
&quot; in@@ cre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . for several moments , you can restore the original status at any time to which such backup was done . this securing comes with an exception system at the next with the exception that it can only be sam@@ pled and not continuously . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up easily on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens when you want to increase safety over ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come to secure a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moments for at least one month and a moment intake should be manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored IP@@ TC files , associated data stored , memory , scal@@ ability , media , reproduction of images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; with that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really interested in you because you remember your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able because of your nature , you must consider anything today with caution and re@@ plen@@ ish during the time . unfortunately , there are no other possibility to come back as the current system . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is currently available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ uses technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . actually , it actually mean enlarge . &quot;
let &apos;s go from that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to increase on a dedicated plate or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this range and put it on a new plate :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new plate was recognized by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source , the new plate is / dev / S@@ DC and dollar ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS / dev / im@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software that can read it then you can create this self . this task is easier to start year .
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , they should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and a slow compression features . this format we want to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can store in un@@ compressed shape or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression @-@ free compression ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed @-@ free and open resource format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the need for met@@ ad@@ ata formats . it is already available on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a key information technology that allows users to create a file itself . the file information will be stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format to archive . X@@ MP does not fit the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the picture file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core met@@ ata initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which includes a wide range of applications and modelling , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ful efforts to achieve a comprehensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera field , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert Roh@@ files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine machining , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut down among other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , then use in MPEG , use in contact leaf@@ lets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; in the section add a photos to an album , you can add a description on your hard disk . but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings to import images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ sian . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; to use , connect this with the calcul@@ ator , turn the camera on the display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig -@@ indicator is displayed at the lower end and the umb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ ways features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialog displays file characteristics and the photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded on your computer . note that at some digital cameras do not have any information available .
&quot; the tab met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata page bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; or the image editing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their calcul@@ ator is the click on the button and then download the selection of everything . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ b@@ ; . at the download the photos will not be deleted before you delete the pictures from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection method@@ ologies of &amp; K@@ DE ; as soon as you select the photos , use the button to download and then download the selected button . the button selected is up until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these pictures have been downloaded until now . in this case , the new pictures with a star in advance window is marked . if you choose this option , you will only download the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; when you can download the buttons all or chosen ones , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos will be posted . details of the existing records can be found in the section My records , then select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all at once you need to delete the button . if you just want to delete the button , you must select this first and delete them out . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility to restore from the camera , so let the photos have been deleted from the bin@@ der of &amp; K@@ DE ; if you have been completely deleted from the camera , you should be deleted from the camera , if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly useful names . the file names will normally be upgraded after the photos of the camera was deleted in the same album . so it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been done to the fil@@ en@@ ame .
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and sk@@ e@@ wers of the image and for data bases . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transmission opens three more options , which are performed before the photos are stored on the record . the first two concern the data about the author in the Section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ de . if you select this , you will correct the relevant entries from the EX@@ IF information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different file format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % % H : % M : if you want to add the option Date &amp; time . for more adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the opportunity to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters , or if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name , displayed the camera in preview . your settings can be saved and automatically uses when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; can use any information on the orientation of the camera for the time point of recording , to perform an automatic rotation during the heart rate . not all cameras provide this information . in section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the button , use the button , and choose the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is made information about the date on which the photo has been made , you can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; this under@@ lines are based on image data . all images are available in the same sub@@ album . all images with the same date may be downloaded in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you &apos;ll need to use this option . use the button Advanced and select the data sheet based on the lower end of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos from their calcul@@ ator on their camera , is the button to download . select the selection dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is dealt , asking &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; you , where the images should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to delete the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and the data can be displayed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link to a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone used a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability to use . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser to create the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; users want to locate the place of the photos , or just want to locate this aspect , it is good to send the position data on a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is , what is the GPS data in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , artic@@ ulations and card refer@@ encing . so , there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a follow @-@ up of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of well @-@ known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver together . either as a card module or via transmission of the data using a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you must save these data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that extract the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same below &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and width of lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script which works using the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of ar@@ rests , e.g. from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;

action select can display on embedded preview or Image Processing . you put the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; firmly when you click on one entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ acy and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the respective IP@@ TC data fields if the data processing is written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym of the constitution : this field should be the professional name of photographers , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the car field , this also must be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : do not use this field to provide the picture , then these organizations should not be registered , then these organizations should be registered , then the picture should be listed here , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently stored in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and can be imported without lost .
&quot; image labeled as embedded prot@@ ections ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments which you can add to your photos , with which included in the images are included . attention : in pictures that already contain traces of labels , these may be over@@ written by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the page settings include all options for the information that appear , if the mouse poin@@ ter will rest in the main window over a file . according to the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to determine which data types &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants came ; signi@@ fying , you can add the file extension to this list and remove any file in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no such expan@@ sions , from &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset you back by pressing the button actu@@ alize right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; can be set on this page on the default values . every pictures you have different sizes and syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; if you have one , then you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can hereby receive better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ lined areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in the image editing , this specific mode can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the pictures in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance is encoded as in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next explanation . &quot;
&quot; using the P@@ NG compres@@ sing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ loss algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thus 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the T@@ IF@@ F @-@ files , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression blade for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F pictures . it has no influence on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can store loss @-@ free . even if you have written the loss @-@ loss rate , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ou , the image processing was only a picture viewer intended for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard rate is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference is slightly soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes the picture a little soft , eliminated , but the 2x@@ 2 gene pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD cameras . using the second sensors it has the effect that more details can be obtained in four steps . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your pictures are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera the sh@@ lich@@ ter to look through the in@@ ability of your camera . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not so quick satur@@ ation like green and red . &amp; di@@ gi@@ f came ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture . &quot;
&quot; put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set him a little higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; -@@ image processing should be small , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; a demo process algorithm is a digital image process , to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ filtered image sensor that provide many cameras and a Matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as a CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w came to you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour ink of your lenti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color of color correction , as you are done during the conversion time . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; like to translate the colour information from a colour space in the other , so the colors are as exactly as possible . &quot;
behaviour issues when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with rough files .
&quot; color profile folder S@@ etting here the file , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you can save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; exam@@ ines this folder then during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have the ability &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to rear . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be created to the camera manufacturers and model you need to use . not all profiles are added to the same kind . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or gamma correction . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are further options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors , so you can manually correct instead of the blind algorithm . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is for them for what is scheduled . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles will fit together . this answer is obviously un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for neutral , P for neutr@@ ally , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image detail and image processing . many modules have been written to collabor@@ ate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . select them out which you want to use , and these modules will be loaded as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond . &quot;
&quot; commands for tasks that are carried out by modules , can be set up in the menu below settings . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project using htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org , or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted to the time between the image trans@@ itions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other cross @-@ fields turn the met@@ ad@@ ata a / or out which are in the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all cameras supported on the left side . on the right side , one button automatic detection , which is connected to a camera that is connected to the computer . at present , there are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s , on which you insert your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; you need to connect the camera with your computer , put them into the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es ; if you do not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can add all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option to confirm the shift dialog for the shift of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; you can find the conversation of a photos in an album . in the c@@ utt@@ ings of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you will find more details . &quot;
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down and used by &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without question@@ ing . otherwise you need to apply the changes to the button changes .
you can also under@@ take the display of a welcoming screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; at the starting point . this acceler@@ ates the starting procedure of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f .
the setting up after new photos are forced &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; the base folder according to new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; if something from the base folder was deleted &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; you whether it should delete this from the database .
various colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :

&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to watch your photos and for correction , and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking on preview of a picture or by selecting the updated ads / editing . &quot;
&quot; the image editing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; so , they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in section illustrated section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file size , enlargement factor , and current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions . &quot;
&quot; the processing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , any of the functions will not change the original photo , before you can save the original photo using the tool bar , as soon as you have saved the picture . &quot;
&quot; so you should make a copy of your image , before you can change it . this allows you to save with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you do not have the photo stored , you can restore the original image through the button to restore the image processing into the tool@@ bar . you lose any changes you have been conducted in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be re@@ produced or restored . the last action you can turn back , by selecting the re@@ work or restored by selecting the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you use the &amp; L@@ MB ; please select a context menu in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions are also made manifest in between also . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture up , picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save this . &quot;
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the c@@ auti@@ ts menu .
&quot; to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : Mag@@ ni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , where you can use the Es@@ c key . usually , you can see this in the setup dialog of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; you can see this in the dialog dialog of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze . see the section to set up the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print the image file image and get the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole phr@@ ases . all images can choose from your selection . you have to select only the pictures with the standard methods . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard menu , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation devices , even in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same tab leaves the side@@ bar and disappear again in the edge .
&quot; in the coating view , you can type labels with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut out after 2000 characters , and special characters can be used . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you comments on , use either the button application or simply switch to the next picture , the labels will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , this will always be performed when you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings . &quot;
&quot; the section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard turn@@ table C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word illustrates a search box for the filters of the keywords , the sample tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; -@@ session requested . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the specified search phrase . you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief for the entry of key@@ word in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the respective check boxes in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar will be used with their record , - dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filter from the right hand , only the cutting volume of these two are displayed . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and lay down . if the key@@ word is already selected , you can draw several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word exists , you can easily draw on the right side bar and put on the selection . subsequently , a dialog appears if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is displayed on no keywords , which was chosen by Str@@ ong + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word was drawn to the selection and put aside . a dialogue asks , whether this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched to various settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or his needs , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can find an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to set options , just take the check box at the end of the rule and to use the button group@@ ing . the options will then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I mainly used to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one sets out a color @-@ administered workflow is that the colours of your camera or scanner will have a pre@@ dict@@ able deviation from the actually photographed or used cann@@ ing colors . with a color @-@ administered workflow . you can print and publish the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners from your digital dark chamber .
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know what buttons he needs to push for the results . unfortunately , this tut@@ orials is to provide you enough background information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informative decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flows were fulfilled every six below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about paint management . &quot;
you can work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
&quot; your only other aspect expend@@ itu@@ res are by e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB der de facto is de facto . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well , and life for all so easy , why should one use another colour space , and to make thoughts about color wounded . &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the s@@ RGB of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours we can really see below is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that can be seen , the hu@@ b @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour bro@@ oks , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to con@@ gest@@ ure my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! if you do not work in the RGB colour space or not , you have to connect your monitor to s@@ RGB , so you need to use your monitor via s@@ RGB k@@ alli@@ on , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard cali@@ br@@ ate , a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting to continue continuous manual . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , removable , automation and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ating automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects , to see what is best at your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the whole picture above the whole picture , so the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible . this function is often a magnet@@ ised correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ rupt@@ ing : this method Adjust@@ able the beam factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity channels as as flat as possible . thereby , it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracle in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border sha@@ des and adjust the red , green and blue channels onto the entire history range . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and intensity of RGB values of a picture by shifting the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new ji@@ u@@ cle@@ ation of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the bald @-@ like of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to carry the white off of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is limited to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to work far from the original image , such can be done with over@@ exposed coating , if you are working in the 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will be better to correction . &quot;
this tool is based on a white ab@@ sal@@ utation by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you will start on the menu entry colours white off the image processing .
&quot; the advance window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original picture shows both the original image and the preview of the factory . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish , then it is enough to click the bottom window . &quot;
the preview photos has a red markers . the lumin@@ ance of the pi@@ er below this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is indicated that once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow for alignment lets you improve the att@@ ends details of your photos , or dim@@ mer down . &quot;
&quot; with the above checks , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture to use the colour temperature for the colour temperature of the white surface . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ flow monitor increases the colours if more than a color channel of the pi@@ d is over@@ exposed . this is displayed combined as a pure indicator . this is displayed in the preview of the final image .
buttons as and store are exactly this . every adjustment of the white surface you can set you in a text file and download later .
the button lets you default all the filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white de@@ br@@ is . please note that neutral settings will be another photo than your original . if you save this store your original image is changed .
&quot; you can adjust the coding per color channel of the working picture . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more plate , calculation time and is available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the under@@ window for the use of color profiles . you can drag the chapter of color management to rate .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under colors below color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple colour channels simultaneously and allows you to use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , please find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you can find gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze has four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created if one developed a partial pressure of a short flash , and afterwards the development of the picture was completed . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is possible . another increase is created , finally a negative image that is not available on Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar effect effect . the original image is ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contrast effect that makes colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one to daylight , produced color film from the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture photographers . Vel@@ via offers strongly saturated colors , especially to which the hardly any landscapes are under@@ going . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light to the contrast ratio . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sh@@ ale repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lights . in large pictures the filter can get the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color @-@ color and lumin@@ osity of your photo using the tools in the menu . once you are happy with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are used .
&quot; if you make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a great choice for brightness / satur@@ ation can be a good choice for satur@@ ation . all changes you can do in the preview . if Him do the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tools Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve exposure . even if the dialog appears to this tool very complicated , you need only the field of sli@@ der . speci@@ fies the three sli@@ ders below the history program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , of the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are placed in the inside and the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to shift the controllers , and make sure the image changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated on the left , are the following options available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , the hist@@ ogram can be displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic scale is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark sounds , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three paint brushes can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically adjust the input of the shadow , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow manual values for each range . there are also two controllers used in order to evaluate the output values , for example , to create a slightly larger image than in the background , while something else can be seen in the background . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , images are automatically set in depending on the image values . &quot;
&quot; save as and store : using these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and later loaded , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will automatically be adjusted for all sha@@ dows , medium and sun oils and click the preview of the original image for rot@@ or , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option crossing di@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to preview over@@ exposed pixels and indicate the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you &apos;ll see the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see an example for Ali@@ gn@@ ment of the input on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the origin@@ als and the target image will appear . the preview will be dynamic depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
Modi@@ fi@@ f@@ ere canal : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
&quot; in addition to these boxes , two symbols will be able to change between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures showing with a digital camera , the linear mode generated a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps the log@@ arith@@ mic mode . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cran@@ ed arrow to the right , for example , the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones corresponding with dark ones , and the associated image pixel dar@@ ker will be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this marking on the range you want to change , a matching line on the curve is displayed which is the original value . create a point on this line and adjust then , until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
store as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you can create this in the file system and later to be loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; automatically create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun oils . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the Rot@@ - , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposed coating controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here , it is an indicator that you can see the effect , and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a black @-@ white photo taken in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun oils was used with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mixer of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; image editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour sha@@ des of the pictures . you can process it from the menu @-@ mixer @-@ mixer of image processing .
&quot; with the edge in@@ quisition box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels you can preview the relative distribution and rash . the original section of the window can be viewed as a preview of the original rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red markers . if you positioning this in the picture , a vertical line will appear in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ators for Red , Green and Construction allow you to change these channels . this is especially practical if you are also able to keep the colour mixer then DAS tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction in a color comes from a visible noise that looks from a colour space . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the far@@ ction first . &quot;
save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer adjustment can store you up later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option crossing di@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to preview over@@ exposed pixels and indicate the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you &apos;ll see the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a picture in the blue canal . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ cting capacity . the development of digital photography is black / white a work step that can be easily converted to the calcul@@ ator . also with a set of movie profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange filtered . &quot;
red filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lenti@@ cular filter . this creates dramatic effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ ism to day @-@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
&quot; sep@@ i@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit cold into the shadow , this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching and recovery in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; to add a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu image determines image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the note of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ a.com ; tool frame can add a decorative frame around a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not a easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to keep the image a decorative frame . this is an psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you put the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ished the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) attached it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with patterns .
&quot; width : is the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; the target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple , form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture at any time . this also goes to more places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text items , orientation , color from color space and character set . the bigger the image must be custom@@ ised . for the end , simply select one frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
any adjustment which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click OK . after the picture has been saved is the text part of the image . it cannot be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; tool sten@@ cil template you can put a template on a picture .
the menu image sten@@ cil apply in image processing can be used to put templates on a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to the reduction of file size . if you have to add a email in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ arrived @-@ user @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you are copied to the template . these settings are displayed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , three buttons are available with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button is enlarged the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered in order to cent@@ ered the mouse button . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button resi@@ zed this picture . if you want to use the mouse button . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture you need to minim@@ ize the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and put it on the desired position .
&quot; OK . if you want to use the template on your image , then the image will be adjusted automatically . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; introduces three different tools to sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but generates especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; un@@ sharp@@ ening mask works on the contrast of the edges around a picture of shar@@ per . actually , it &apos;s no bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to avoid atmospheric Dun@@ st and makes it a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and he is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; probably the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application , and has various parameters for adaptation . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus and most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is the smaller than the resolution , meaning that sharp edges will be printed together with a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require more retro@@ spec@@ tively than normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
&quot; at JPEG pictures , a camera is commonly used in internal sharp@@ ening . images in the base format must always be sharp@@ ened in the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanners apply a sharp@@ ened filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by sharp@@ ening a photo with sharp@@ ening agent . this allows you to deal with the menu entry to Cor@@ rig@@ ging sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; you should hereby be careful because the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , you can focus on the sharp@@ ening technique . in general , you will find further information and comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ isp@@ y . the solution to draw a bit soft is much easier than it . use the tool for soft@@ ening with the menu entry , and experiment with the settings . the advance window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview can help the image process . the front window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate often good results and should first be tried first . an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ ened mask to make noise , noise and impression of grass close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius presents like many pixels on each side of a cann@@ on by the filter . high @-@ resolution pictures allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore sharp@@ est pictures best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red picture one which is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the necessary difference amount . it can be used to define a minimum difference for a channel of filters . in this way , areas with a soft shift between the pot@@ ions are excluded from the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness , Himm@@ les and water surface . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the in@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the revised picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a well@@ being = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected un@@ protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to stim@@ ulate a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing quot ; in which it is a better approach to sharp@@ ening the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ tering . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Film . it is using the use of an un@@ sharp@@ ening mask . you can start using the menu by using colors re@@ focus on editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular we@@ dge is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ade . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ lap has a very long tail , which leads far from the source pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is also influenced by the remote pixel . it causes un@@ wanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for use of this module . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most images , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set up a higher value , but if your picture should be very sharp then you should pay attention to Heiligen@@ damm . &quot;
&quot; correlation : increasing the correlation can be reduced by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can be reduced to you . the filter can accept values of 0 @-@ 1 . however values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low ; the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to decor@@ ate the image .
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your im@@ sharp@@ ness use it . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . in most cases you might also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; mat@@ ri@@ mal size : this value determines the size of trans@@ verse material . an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any reproduction parameters have set you , so it will be saved for later and then can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cutting , color , and int@@ oler@@ tions on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture . for this reason , the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible that left un@@ pleasant Ar@@ te@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; to read and read images , eg ; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked produce better results than sharp@@ ening . this might be caused by doing so sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , no sharp m@@ asked needs to produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never be able to remove the effect of the nu@@ b filters . practically the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the most common mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ clear color picture has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information about methods for sharp@@ ening methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the regulator is the un@@ sharp@@ ening of the area of the dark , in order to generate more natural P@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the colour tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ voice Algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ferences as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
&quot; in case you want to adjust the filter settings , you can also use the rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; details &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth glass beyond the image . a value of 0.9 should be given that no sharp@@ ening is necessary . please note that there should be any sharp@@ ening if necessary . &quot;
&quot; configuration depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small amount of smooth@@ es evenly across all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a high level of similar patterns , JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be best possible at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ ass@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value for the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned with larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually this is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle gradu@@ al length &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is being selected , there should also be small for a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixel . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing , and never get bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the quality which you receive by selecting this option is only small . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him .
buttons as and store are exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be correct in a text file and later to be loaded .
image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button break .
&quot; below , you can see how image error has been corrected using Small Ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is used in a photo that was created in Guatemala city with an analog@@ ous camera . as you see there is a unique black ar@@ te@@ ar@@ act in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce bil@@ lows . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear .
&quot; this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ es ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sens@@ ations of digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be smooth@@ ed by the radius given the picture and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and caused smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch to adjust the filter to the front . if the value is high , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details will not get more and sound or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , you can &apos;t remove the entire noise or noise tips . put it on a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you either change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ other process through the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you either change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ other process through the details settings .
&quot; gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically per@@ ver@@ ted more strongly , however the shadow of shadow . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ ding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is lifted up , gl@@ aze and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can appear on the edges . he can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution , the image is a bit soft , it is thank@@ fully easier than a picture to use the menu to create soft soft@@ shell and experim@@ enting with the gl@@ itter@@ ing box . the advance window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans ; Foto restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ works .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grains , scrat@@ ches , compression and retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alised pictures . the smo@@ othing occurs in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ ally digit@@ ally digit@@ ally . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the text replacement is developed with another tool which was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ as and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas too . as a loss @-@ loss composition &amp; quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ compressed image . this attitude shall correct these problems .
buttons save as and store exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved in a text file and later to be loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
&quot; below , you can reduce like a photo with DC @-@ shaped noise . the module is applied to an Il@@ ford ( TM ) 700@@ Si camera to a Il@@ ford ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film grains on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo taken by using a scanner . you can see the scan Ar@@ te@@ facts that can be seen from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo image below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; General tools Hot@@ pixel allows the hot@@ line of photos that have been used with a CCD camera . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ ens .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression of hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ tra@@ cting method . there are currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the picture .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in connection to explore new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first described , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image . please note that the assistant becomes the last dark picture , and this automatically invites you to the next meeting . &quot;
the picture area and preview can help you correct within the image . the front window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all positions .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ham : an average of neighbouring pixel is determined . it is assigned to all defective pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block will be drawn up to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the broken pixel in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn , in order to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block . &quot;
cube : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixel in the block .
&quot; below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants came ; Vig@@ net@@ mask correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ scape , i.e. , to correct corners , a picture . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lens , in particular , in the middle and large photo format , they can often reduce the complete sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ dy ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light on the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective conditions also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but it also dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 when the bl@@ ending filter , which should be able to keep the necessary se@@ per@@ ation period , even with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or less , because otherwise in@@ fusion effects are created by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ let and the colour and gray tra@@ des of digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by a equivalent transformation to an image that is made without these filters . the algorithm is protected by a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ osity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a bl@@ ending setting of 2 , or randomly a lumin@@ osity level of 2 , to compens@@ ate it by a small degree that is compens@@ ated for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; leu@@ ch@@ asing , contrast and gamma @-@ settings : the processing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the target image with these options . the controllers need only positive values available , as you have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more sensitive rec@@ ali@@ ation of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the v@@ ign@@ ity in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; Lin@@ king dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric confusion . lim@@ bs can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion of the lens and can be corrected the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar effect effect , but fla@@ wed to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the degree of co@@ effici@@ ents corrected the remote corners to the second degree . when you combine these two , every geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion is virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion part of the second degree . with negative values , tons of cav@@ ity can be corrected , and positive values ho@@ ver@@ sely dist@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion @-@ grade degree . this value affects more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls , the &apos; corners parameters has the same sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads through a correction first degree . negative values increase while positive the picture .
bright : this value adjusted brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog illustrated with a preview of dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values . &quot;
&quot; the tons or ho@@ ver@@ ry @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . best result , use this correction as all the first . if you have a picture to cut and then a tonne @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of apparent field of fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal aux@@ iliary line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the tons / ho@@ ver@@ ical dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ sive dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will be black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transformer and remove the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most images , the tons @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings are the perspective to correct that every angle in the picture is 90 degrees . please note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate Infr@@ ared film of the G@@ enn@@ as @-@ org web site that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the range for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film grains and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grains and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; as the filter colour channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ ming image from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the revised picture below ( 2 ) and the image of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the sh@@ lich@@ és .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ b@@ ade ; filter fil@@ aments is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grains on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X , known to enhance the sensitivity of the films . &quot;
&quot; the film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be used to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grain size . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter . &quot;
this is an example of the film production effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers in order to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better for large pictures . smo@@ othing controls the gl@@ are or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel image is 1 and gl@@ assy 17 .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon@@ ic outline . the lines that the outline are slowly , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you have chosen to outline what scene you would have chosen to outline . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the size , and the bottom locking the contrast ( gl@@ itter@@ ing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; Filter engraving your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ling landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the revised image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 is dist@@ orted to the image here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a artwork by un@@ sharp@@ ening effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; elast@@ icity : wi@@ ped the image along st@@ ern@@ al lines , which can be seen from a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography . &quot;
Radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : rot@@ ates the image by turning the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; motion @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera . &quot;
soft@@ ening Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny bright focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ot@@ un@@ sharp@@ ening : dist@@ orted the image through random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary motion .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : find the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ pe them without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves on your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n @-@ copyright protected algorithm .
tropical size allows to change the size of the drops . as the trop@@ hy size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures . fish au@@ ds changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ a.com ; image processing can hold a range free of shelves . use the range of tools to choose the area , for example a face that will remain free of charge . if you start the filter rules , the area will remain free of shelves . &quot;
this is an example of the shelf life . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset on a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it by sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools you will find in the menu transformer or transformer . &quot;
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photograph at a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to shr@@ ink@@ ers is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture bub@@ bles and the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here , makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow . &quot;
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . it uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm used by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio is maintained : when this setting is enabled , the new size of the original size is the original size of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned with larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes gl@@ az@@ ed . this is necessary if you want to create a lot of noise . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons save as and store are used exactly . every single image can be saved as text file and later to be loaded .
&quot; photo shooting is very fast in what it makes , but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
you can see below an example for photograph exposed in a small color picture . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard increase .
&quot; the cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated operation . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the field of photos will be cut off . this allows you to change a good overview of your photo after cutting the rectangle . a new rectangle will create you by using the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cut section , use the kno@@ b button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file storing or save the file to store the newly added photo . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ conception area , you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio which you defined in dialogue remains . &quot;
&quot; in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and the width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool is cutting a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you use centi@@ meters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to set the choice automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue , you can set with the Max . ratio button to cut the size on the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation , set . &quot;
&quot; the tool depends on aspect ratio , its settings depends on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or vertically ) . if you are using the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data can reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of gathering aid enables help to send help to create your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like third parties , harmon@@ ious triangles are possible to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the diagonal . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus bi@@ al or the flower leaves of a sunflower . it shows all possible things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used even with the old Egyptians and Greeks , that in order to put your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you create your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; as from where each number is after 1 equal to the sum of their two progres@@ sing . one composition is considered to be a visual harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden center provides li@@ que@@ fied aid lines provided if you make a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third parties , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the spiral and creates a symm@@ etri@@ cal visual flow along this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . there should be something that the eye can lead to the heart of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can only be done without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden triangles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the middle point of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are not equivalent to these lines , a static object can be more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden triangles to break your frame , a effect that is called dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ section and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently . &quot;
&quot; the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertically mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles . &quot;
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can invisible the aux@@ iliary lines . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines in your current picture . &quot;
&quot; the free rotation is a tool , in order to rotate a picture of any angle . &quot;
&quot; if you do a photo , then it happens easy to fix the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . they can fix it with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . select the transformation of free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; rotate your picture with the sliding angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees , you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will appear on the right . &quot;
&quot; to help your help , the Free press module offers a horizontal and vertical line . after you move it on an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function of trans@@ forming to use of the image processing . &quot;
a more elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ cent@@ ric Transform@@ ations are conducted to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle of degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the top : shows the current angle of degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left : shows the current angle of degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right : shows the current angle of degrees on the bottom right corner of the transformed territory .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective , the picture will be slightly emb@@ ell@@ ished . for single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments will create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have attached the perspective , you get unbe@@ atable tri@@ ang@@ ular holes at the corners . one way to ber@@ some this is the image with transformer cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; this tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and the other part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the picture will be dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module over trans@@ forming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; adjust your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time . if you need to default , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the viewing area . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is built . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the right mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use this tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the calibration , the picture becomes a bit confused . for a single scar@@ ce , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ uses are dou@@ bly negle@@ cted , so you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after closing , the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the image with transformer cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type like this libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions , you can process a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; edit them . &quot;
&quot; due to these dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on this site . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ze ; displays only files in formats , which is listed on the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression method on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version may also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the resource format , you can read using Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; . &quot;

K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of pictures exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
&quot; if you take steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast is already very good , then you can carry the first four alignment markings with the module white . &quot;
many tools you need the photo@@ editing are included &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; included . their description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft sign , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , in@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a standardized dialog type , which is applied to the current picture . below , you see &amp; quot ; texture on the following picture ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress indicator shows the status of the filter to the current picture . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison range of the pre@@ conception . these modes are :
&quot; vertically , without dup@@ lic@@ at . the left area shows the original and the right hand shows the filter to the right of the selected pre @-@ viewing area . &quot;
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper area shows the original and the lower screen shows the filter to the area below the selected pre @-@ viewing area . &quot;
divide vertical . the left area shows the original and the rights to the effect of the filter .
share horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the pre@@ conception and , otherwise , the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be logged in to show over@@ - and under@@ line exposure . the used colors may be adapted to the general setup site .
( 3 ) The frame for a preview of preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and click on the part of the picture you want to see . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely expl@@ aining . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider gives an intuitive user search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move up and move . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally makes your pictures ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and used for use of colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE , can either apply for the whole system or only one user . in the latter , they are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color , and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue range , they can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search files according to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as line as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour beside it . the color is described under the palace view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to elect . in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with pres@@ sive lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m Curs@@ or is activated below the button color , the color is inserted into the cur@@ sor on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writing another ; depending on whether the mode is selected or transferred . this mode allows you to write to the crossing field over@@ writing by B@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection of which produced as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line of line , if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , this can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the pal@@ let and the output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; on the screen , choose a color somewhere on the screen and then select it on the left side . &quot;
&quot; &amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graphic vi@@ z ; graph@@ s . graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . so far , the programs published &amp; graph@@ s ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program to view &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s ; displays are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; Kate ; gives the graph@@ s new and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; open or open graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph ; open in one &amp; Kate ;
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
&quot; additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Program , which sets the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tools &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph@@ s required . we are needed in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in an own lower window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen image . in this case , the tool bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . Click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , a chart will appear in the corner , if the graph is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the bike ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you can see the maximum reduction of a graph . &quot;
&quot; if the just changed in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; downloaded file from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can you realize your decision later , you can change your decision later , you can use the Settings point settings ; see also , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ table ; instance , eg ; in a file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph ; instance , or want to end graph@@ s in an under@@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice but also to change the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
you can also set how the graph is to be divided into multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be selected freely .
&quot; if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the Graph@@ ene come on a site that will be set to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graphite . &quot;
&quot; side view with one on several sides , graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font &quot;
&quot; the site again gives the option to determine the behavior , if a file has changed on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or to ignore any changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page open the ability to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ table ; determine if a graph outside of a running session is opened , you can open a standard behavior for this case ( Graph@@ ene in a new window ) or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site seat is the opportunity to determine the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( the files of the last meeting or not ) , or determine if you are asking for each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which is usually at one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , further features : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ s ; layout algorith@@ ms . entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ s ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or sk@@ ating represent@@ ations of @-@ related graph@@ s . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as possible few cant@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ ent graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . in this process , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , the same is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; Algorith@@ m generates a ski@@ pping model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the fru@@ hl@@ ess @-@ pure gold color characteristic , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the knots of circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue in which you can specify a lay@@ outs , which will then be executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of graph@@ s according to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format will give special options , or modify the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ done ) and turns the standard algorith@@ ms for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ disputed graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if needed . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . Click this mouse to get a &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT to get more help to this item ( if present ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add GPS coordinates to the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and process . the ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF sample of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface may result in a number of selected images using a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to invite a possible correlation with time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization . this file contains of course data which have been recorded at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed in red . GPS track data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone . &quot;
&quot; setting for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera production . the deviation under it is included , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you have no trace data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and the difference in minutes can be used , if you have no appropriate data . if you know that in reality an loc@@ ating in a large period of time between camera and GPS , you can set these limits to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialogue . this is useful if you have a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog use the coordinates to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found with the displayed map , and then be found . choose the relevant region and increase this . the card can always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually . the card can always be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module you can depend on the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can select your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages compliant to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that will be exported as HTML pages . the character set is encoded with UTF @-@ 8 , to enable a best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to HTML . they need to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . they don &apos;t need to select a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely expl@@ aining itself . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your default setting , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed on the picture . &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your related pictures , select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information is also stored in the new pictures in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; using other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size influences . all other settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; the rider Vor@@ umb@@ nails allows you some of the settings from the album rider for viewing images , that are small pictures displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press off break down the process .
&quot; when the module creates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program message , if error occurred during production . web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures , and on them basic operations such as swi@@ ft@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shift . the viewer can be used with short command and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without any quality .
&quot; this module allows , to store images below , photos in JPEG format , without the usual losses on quality and met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising , as no compression of colour information is taking place . this is , for example , in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams among K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata Editor is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from a picture to another . select the image dialog with which you want to copy the file extension dialog with which you want to copy the copy image . the data will be copied after you on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Code is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic image file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled on the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can create a background colour for the di@@ asch@@ au . in addition you can use the formats DVD / XVI CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; first , you must first select the pictures that can be packed into the m@@ asch@@ au m@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be chosen from different formats , DVD , radio cd , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; next step , you should specify the time in seconds to indicate a picture . the speed of the image is set below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth change . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . in doubt , you should have the name and the path of the created file , you can keep using the m@@ ute mp@@ g under name . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you can enjoy all settings of your needs . depending on the speed of your computer you can go fast or enjoy a coffee and enjoy the di@@ ec@@ au , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below . &quot;
&quot; the printer assistant allows several pictures to print on a sheet of paper . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the Gim@@ p image format . this is , for example , to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your files stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ sharing tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
&quot; first , choose the RA@@ W file that will be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter appears then in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can look the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white waste . the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue the picture later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and store conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ loss algorithm , and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later , you should not use the JPEG format as it is only allowed a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use it . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , for example through testing on a single image that are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier test . however , this is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program support from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . they can shr@@ ink the image or enlar@@ ges four kinds of image change :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically chosen , depending on the picture orientation , which remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen size .
proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is modified by this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photography . the user can adjust the printing solution and size of the photo setup . the target image , including background size , size and background colour , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . there is also possible to change the size of the pictures before . more pictures can draw on the list of the pictures and place there . &quot;
&quot; after you started the module , the pictures window with the displayed images are displayed . over the button pictures you can add further pictures with a file optional dialog . for the last selected picture , a preview on the right page is displayed . &quot;
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of people &apos;s list .
&quot; using the button pictures , the selected images from the list of the pictures are removed . &quot;
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message on your e @-@ mail clients with the button . you &apos;ll just need to add the addresses and the subject . these images are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails , if you want to send many pictures . &quot;
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and once again uses you to change them .
&quot; choose your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll have to specify the correct path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the comments of comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and add the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss @-@ free formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you should have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under photos file format and the original files in JPEG format are , then the original @-@ Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to sen@@ g pictures . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can watch the status reports , in search for errors , you can automatically start at the end . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . using the button , you can send this window ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to have shown your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL trans@@ itions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant picture trans@@ itions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the sealing is very slow . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures in the left @-@ hand corner will be displayed during the presentation . &quot;
&quot; the loop gives you the presentation in a final loop , you can then go manually with Es@@ c . &quot;
the option images randomly select that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album .
del@@ aying time between the pictures can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effects . this means you should show the presentation of your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random cho@@ oses a different effect on each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar you can start the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower screen of the screen , you can see the current file names , the position of the current picture and the entire number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I Module Time &amp; Date Adjust@@ able is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams among K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the surface of the surface .
&quot; this module sets the current selected image , depending on the selected option of the base , as in the background for your K@@ DE workers . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see &amp; photo album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , so in each group , in people , places and in group keywords entries are present . &quot;
&quot; in your browser window , you can see the categories as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to see the folder structure on your hard disk and look at the current demonstration models . in the following , each for itself is described . &quot;
&quot; when you push the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are displayed , on which both individuals can be seen . by this selection method you can limit the number of pictures of a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; you can view all the people , places and other settings , you can view the pictures of your action range . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , of course , for each person , the same applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see also the image . &quot;
&quot; to preview pictures next to the name , select the button on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the drawing menu , you can choose which you can choose a list for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your key@@ word ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to indicate what image is shown for each individual person . in order to view this , you &apos;ll need to select the picture @-@ c@@ auti@@ ts window ( in closer ) , and select the image for the appropriate person . in the check window , you can select the image factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image is displayed and cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you are searching for the entry in the main window , a dialogue will appear to you , the dialog for the ceremony of the image properties very similar . this dialogue may take you on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field labelling or description , the labels or descriptions of the pictures are searched after this text ; the date can be found either a part of the overall date , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window you can see all the pictures after certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to images , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user hand@@ book for &amp; k@@ photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read books , but rather equal functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo album ; and look at the quick entry to the screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start your demo album and start in the first dialogue , if you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry k@@ photo album ; later , some example will be loaded and you can try out the functions of &amp; k@@ photo album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo album ; see the current bar here . a picture of this strip you can see here : . as the name tells you will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each lending displays then another unit . you can change between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the strip only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the current bar can be interactive on the following ways : you can select the displayed message view from the database ( if you select a date , you will see the first picture of this date in the preview picture ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images , if you are viewing in the preview section . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so the time data , are displayed in the preview @-@ view only pictures of this period . you can click the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo album ; offers you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo album ; integrated and the other than module is available ; built in &amp; k@@ photo album ; integrated version you can create over the HTML menu ... instantly .
&quot; before HTML pages , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , any area is further described . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of over@@ looked and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML @-@ pages pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo album ; export file is to be created on the over@@ sight side . see information about export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is shown on the viewer . for example , you can &apos;t use any pictures of a party . at the moment you can &apos;t use this attitude to hide certain pictures from certain points . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML page should look like . most setup possibilities are unique , which is why not specifically made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for images . therefore , those need to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore display your pictures with a lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as well . if he wants to get a picture larger , it moves to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , you place the various folders and the URL to where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best choose your HTML files for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you must select the main folder , in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to all future pictures the memory location . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this is really visible for viewing a URL . if you have been created for the basic folder a web browser , after the pages have been created , you should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files are not yet installed in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them here . thus , the import function , see , correctly , you have to specify the final destination of files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder are . &quot;
&quot; the just described options described are all three on base folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you set in output file . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; c@@ unt album ; you can naturally give you a HTML page to viewing the pictures , you &apos;ll have to enter your pictures on pictures , recording , etc . , you do not have to do with &amp; k@@ photo album ; they do not even want to do this job again . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other into your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external servers . they differ in it if the images itself is stored in the file , or if you can only add a link to the file , the advantage is that you can hold all pictures together and that this file is so independent . the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File / export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two times . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog is described for exp@@ orting images you can exp@@ orting over the File File . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
&quot; if you are copying the manual on the .@@ k@@ im file , you &apos;ll need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo album ; the pictures automatically set for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most pictures have already been very small with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is normally not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you are sending your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file might be very big . here you can say that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and broad . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File , select &amp; k@@ photo album ; the exported database as described in detail . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to imports consists of four steps . first , you need to select what pictures you would like to import , afterwards , in which folders should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are called the category of person@@ alised file person@@ er ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialogue window , and which categories are to be imported into your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can cancel the categories of imported file with the categories of your present database . an example of this you can see on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to search pictures and view : if you look at pictures , you would often see images within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps from the ( 1 ) scale of the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the search and look ahead , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual will have talked about images , but frequently it includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; saves all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a dis@@ kette or revisions in the CV@@ S . &quot;
&amp; cool album ; not@@ ices the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this in future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo album ; so you can start another folder in &amp; k@@ photo album ; as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / Company / packaging / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
you can find the settings of a photo album ; set up on a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s book you will be explained to you the various setup possibilities .
&quot; on the left , you can see six different symbols , with which you can open a look at the preview and options for viewing the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available for setting up the F1 key and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described in you how to set up for each image , such as persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; when you see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a labelling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set entire membership groups , such as all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a center as stated in a group . &quot;
&quot; in view of the options available , you can select the category . with the above @-@ adjusted selection list you can select the category you can configure . in the left window of the window , you can configure a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo album ; divi@@ des his modular system with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug @-@ in interface . please refer to the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; c@@ auti@@ ous album ; but most modules have a help page that you can use over the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules of multiple applications can be used together with each other , it can test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , you should always call new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have been warned . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulates &amp; c@@ unt album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture shows . &quot;
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo album ; the modules have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo album ; S browser shows the content of a category , for example , all the people , then every entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have specified in the dialog box as a category for virtual albums , for example , for example , if you have chosen the category , so do , if you have chosen persons to view and pass the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . use the setup dialog , and select the module modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; start your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top of a menu - and a tool@@ bar . in the section we will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will not show more information about your pictures . in the section we will click on this window , and then click on this window , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo album ; is the possibility to view any picture taken on the picture , where the picture has been taken on , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and Brow@@ se , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists using a text field , setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo album ; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the distin@@ ctions of the pictures within the list : if you are depicted in the list , for example , if you are depicted on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the used names are moved upwards , to find persons faster and arrange them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive a alphabetical list below , click on the symbol for sorting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen notes on each image individually , you may still want to edit all selected images and select these images with notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu option to use multiple entries at once with one note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . in order to indicate that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Overview dialog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ coming or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also attach an entry into a category and place to make this entry into an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically . see also . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the package dialog@@ s by clicking the glue that form the upper edge of the frames , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drag him out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window . &quot;
you can also complete a frame in a frame . if you want to see this window later you will use the button options ... and then window a / off . see this process in the picture .
&quot; for example , if you select the record images in your browser , you will have an overview of the currently selected images , or all the pictures you don &apos;t have a filter here . for example , you can configure the size of the umb@@ nails using the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have no window covered with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also er@@ ase images in the image . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you would like to delete and select either the removing key , or select in the menu selection . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; cool album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use it with &amp; k@@ photo album ; namely pictures you can also use the pictures anywhere you can see in the database index . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo album ; if not all needed pictures of the hard disk can be loaded .
&quot; however , pictures where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , see images 1 @-@ 9 . however , these pictures can &apos;t show you the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , you need this feature that you want to copy files from the folders and want to copy them again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid the insert of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you can view the pictures that you can see for other un@@ accessible , and you can see all the pictures you can see for other un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can choose to control and select the menu entry everything except the current view@@ point . &quot;
&quot; that you have set the pictures in the case of the fet@@ ch . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry , allowing all the pictures you have locked down . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to determine a password that needs to be entered for un@@ locking images . to set this password , simply select password change in privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for example , all pictures on the hard drive can be read or extingu@@ ish . this type of password protection is only intended to read the password as inde@@ xed text ; not very familiar to see the look at private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours in order to describe it , of course , that you want to look at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo album . this is why you can see from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; viewing the viewer you can see in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter the picture , such as who is on the image , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , so you can configure this easily with the mouse , and you can also configure which information is displayed and if all these options are displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed in a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple pictures in viewing , you can go between them and go back by using the buttons image and jump down . you can easily reach the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a slide show , and then invites you a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can press a new picture . started and stopped by buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful capability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo album ; it is used to change the full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to change in full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer you can use in the image and out . for her@@ al@@ zo@@ oming , you can simply enter a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button , you can reset the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the equality of the zo@@ oms , each pixel is equivalent to the screen of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that are in and out , with the plus and minus button . &quot;
with the turning menu from the context menu you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can do comments on the current picture with the menu entry into the context menu .
&quot; if you can look at pictures , you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to mark this name . however , you may prefer to mark the picture and see further pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to see the viewer with the pictures and take them as good or bad mark , while you look one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with tra@@ its while looking at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by using the corresponding letter . see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; all categories and special features can be displayed in the pre@@ conception view . if you can view the categories in DR@@ E pre@@ conception , then you can press the features into the pictures by using the letters for the characteristic , after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo album ; painting on the picture .
&quot; the painting is not stored in the image , but in the database . in the way you can turn your up later . &quot;
in order to see a picture on the painted picture . in order to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo album ; click on the picture paint out of the context menu . simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; you have to work , you have to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - views are displayed yellow . &quot;
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of a selected object since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on either the symbol in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu entry into the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , the following folding menu is built , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; using del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have properties changed , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have an invali@@ d values , a message with an error description is displayed . then you can click the input errors and dis@@ card the changes with dis@@ rupt@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; set user documentation in setup dialog , you can use the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the shown object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; edit a texture , or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of your business view . &quot;
&quot; press a preview in the Fe@@ w View and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . if you want to ren@@ ounce the whole texture , even if you want to ren@@ dering a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen image shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen to disappear the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling in the entire window .
each object has a visual level . you can only specify this value relatively to the visible level of the su@@ preme property or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or equal in the tool@@ bar chosen point of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window instructions or if you need another arrangement , you can store them any time . you can also store multiple windows arrangements and change between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to fix a window above or under one present view , drag the shape to the top or lower edge of a view . a rectangle will then show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the suggest@@ ion to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views over each other , drag the suggest@@ ion in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the road@@ map above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window rules are floating views : views , which are not in the main window . to solve a view out of the anch@@ oring , drag the suggest@@ ion to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the top left . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the shape edge . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can fix them on any other . &quot;
the current window view allows you to save with view shut@@ ters ... save . it is displayed a dialog when you can store the window rules under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode covers the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . he determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender &apos;s symbol in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog is open : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image section to ren@@ dering the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination of quality , you can select the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . an exhau@@ sti@@ ve description of the properties found in the User manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can be created . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or lip@@ stick effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this feature is better . &quot;
&quot; if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and links &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is constantly divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel varies between the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray runs a ray per pixel . if the difference between the d@@ ye values to the neighboring pixels , both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the lowering value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 @-@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 @-@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be further pursued and checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that is calculated to calculate the diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can adjust whether the alpha @-@ channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent if the associated beams do not have an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er currently supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
&quot; you can import objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code in the editor to import the source file in the editor and drag him to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and insert into &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; a scene is usually ren@@ dering . usually it is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the shown object . place here the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; if you refer to external files ( for example alt@@ itudes to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to this files here , the first found file will be used here . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected controls .
the color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label .
&quot; you can adjust the object cat@@ cher of the points on the slide button in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the buttons separate for shifts , sc@@ aling , and turning . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more detailed wire model and a better approach for the displayed objects , but require more time for ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the detailed explanation for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided , when the camera is using a extended projection . advanced projections are possible with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a ground below the objects is rendered . the ground is depicted in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross edge satur@@ ation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . in section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window orders . in the section window orders will be explained how to create window orders and save . &quot;
the standard window pattern order : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ written window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can add to the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and may not be empty .
&quot; the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can add on the button , and delete selected views with the button . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with ann@@ els you get the window under the existing window , with ant@@ ei@@ postcard , the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you &apos;ve just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; installed and now you would like to follow more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this manual , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a ball on a plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should be carefully aware of the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; add no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you will only receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have all installed faul@@ t@@ less , see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable idea what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will often use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; model &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera viewed the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , you can see the contents of the view objects in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but please note that you can change the camera in view of the camera , with which you can change the camera &apos;s finish line and drag him to the desired spot . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button or push the input , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree can immediately change this settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could add a qu@@ ader ( insert end body qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a permanent method to solve this task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; in fact , it has a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as bottom : &quot;
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object @-@ tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model view shows also the plain , even at the moment only as a limited end@@ able level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends down to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you have a look at the object tree , you will find that you can click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view@@ point of the object characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the soil to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , only to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to set up its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose a little one at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue , where you can select how the object has to be inserted . please choose the item in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button . see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ment is only showing a sheet of black material because you have to check out the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . for this , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a look at the preview of Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is right now , if you ren@@ dering your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the colour file . here are further settings required . in the color list , you need two new attributes ( you can also use this entry twice ( you can also do this also more frequently , but the box colour list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree , select each time and change the colors in view of the object characteristics : &quot;
you should simply run this step as you can already run the fundamental working mode of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; they have already understood . the ball is just as simple as the ground :
&quot; in view of the objects , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input or button on the button ) so that the ball would be floating over the ground , as you have moved the floor to a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as before , the ball surface is like a sheet of black material . put in the following steps a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the sphere , you can now prove a material . as already on the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; choose first object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . Click on ball pig@@ ment , then select insert and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve interesting effects , if you take time to introduce some finish features : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on applic@@ ability or press the input .
&quot; the settings of shine @-@ effect and reflection is already shown in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metal : not yet chosen : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple , but beautiful scenes you can . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you make a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ verse , the ren@@ dering hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender will be calculated using the objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be performed as an example of fog . so the scene will be edited pixels for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the image is simple . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; open a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file , which you model@@ ed with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; &quot;
&quot; when you open a new model or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest records in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if there is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last store are rejected .
you can only select this menu entry only if you are not stored in the scene .
repeat this command . this menu entry can only select if you are using editing .
&quot; saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialogue , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write a existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; , here you can change the appearance of the keyboard and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard code . you can change or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; -@@ commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add or remove commands with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ki ; add commands .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is one way to prepare rough surfaces , without any bund@@ le on the surface individually , and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself . &quot;
it is usual to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture @-@ map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms , which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ basis , by applying an image file as colour card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and web browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display .
images can be represented either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return Return .
&quot; you can adjust if any image will be displayed in a window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right bottom corner . if a password file is found , the file will be emphas@@ ized by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can adjust the references for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard options can be set for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images will be open in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour , which you can continue reading below . the default is not full screen . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still have the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when editing the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in browser window .
&quot; Click the colored beam to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill in the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can display &amp; c@@ ick@@ show , so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
speci@@ fies if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image changes in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until they are canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the key element for the various operating types of &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; in cart@@ on cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the single file of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays big symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the brief setting .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the brief setting .
shows pre@@ conception for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the brief setting .
reduced the picture by 10 % . the factor is rel@@ ates to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the picture in original size . this is only reasonable if the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of fil@@ en@@ ame , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo editing based on &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; picture processing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous project .
&amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to watch your photos and do correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means , it depends on that the user reports its part to join in at least problems and potential improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show photo ; makes it easy to report possible mistakes or possible improvements . wherever you use this , your browser doesn &apos;t open a page to reports from problems and wishes . all required information can be filled , and you can simply follow the guide to retri@@ eve your message . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a project that will be supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user @-@ mailing list of &amp; show photo ; and we can hope to answer any questions of other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list you will therefore be spoken in English . in this mail@@ ing@@ list you will therefore be powerful .
&quot; the best start to participate &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guide to the developer of the developer mailing list of &amp; show photo ; . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; try to give you as much control over his work runs as possible . there are many options to access the behaviour of &amp; show photo ; you can change in the menu settings ; you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color , which is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ exposed coating should indicate what you should indicate , in contrast . ling@@ ering exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark colour . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show photo , has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar , in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&quot; &amp; h l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning the pictures , which do not power more than pictures to scan and fl@@ ashing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; h l@@ ite ; is an easy application for scanning the scan of images that do not power more than pictures , and save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before the store . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner at the san@@ e project site by selecting the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / C@@ GI @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; channels ; using the command l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialogue to choose the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel the scanner will cancel and exit .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; wa@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; in order to add a picture , the user can only launch a Pre@@ sch@@ can and then for the final scan is looking for the final scan . the Pre@@ lange can be started through the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to select the picture better , the user can zoom into the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview can be set in the window . &quot;
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before saving a preview can be selected in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a preliminary window , as below , will see the picture stored and lie ? en leads to a break and you get into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialogue is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; users can see the image if desired , see before saving . in this case , the option on the store must be selected . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; wa@@ ite ; images stores the dialog for each image open the dialog before each en@@ sc@@ anned picture , then you &apos;ll need to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you &apos;ll need to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the option to store without a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder is used as standard for dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter is defined as a pre@@ fix for the automatically to save images , and is also the proposed image for the image in dialogue to store . the automatically saved image gets uploaded any time when a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; users can adjust the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value for saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button about starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; to end .
&quot; under the GP@@ L , it is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; please note : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs key moments . below , you can send a list of these cuts and their function . on the bottom button you can click here and select the key mouse button in the player window , click on the right mouse button and select short command . &quot;
you may also set existing multimedia keys to work so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ circuit commands . as a result you make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should be describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , look , look like : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ range options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be implemented due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user is not running . &quot;
term &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binary for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in folder scripts or templates , you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply remove the required functions . they will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every K@@ DE installation should be enclosed .
&quot; most scripts were possible to execute external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts will monitor their standard input and respond to events . of course , a script may ignore the events if there are no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure , configure the script dialog . in order to store the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the folder to the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script will now query &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions additional information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title - Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be handed . in order to remove one entry to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script for e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ends , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example . for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using a web server ; such packages are basically regular T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept the script packages containing the Extended amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages just right .
&quot; the key script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and connect the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side of &amp; amar@@ ok ; please use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has lots of useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can easily draw music in the play@@ list instead of going through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a very particular title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Colle@@ ctive browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if you &apos;re still difficult , choose dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Rivers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used . Amar@@ ok is the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following in the base folder from the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty in the compiled trouble . if you encounter problems , please report these to the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; as most of the applications can be able to activate or dis@@ able , as most of the applications you can activate or dis@@ able . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to play@@ list box or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed . &quot;
&quot; voting barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; design : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this allows the used colour scheme for voting rights . &quot;
tuning files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored at the storage location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored at the storage location of &amp; amar@@ ok ; normally ( ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
&quot; external brows@@ ers : can you choose which browser is required by &amp; amar@@ ok , if a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; using other brows@@ ers : here , you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list below . &quot;
&quot; play@@ list to store , save the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; dis@@ able this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; relative paths to manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; current piece can be seen at the piece of time , that the play@@ lists windows open / off to hold the always running piece in the visible window area . &quot;
when changing the context @-@ browser you will automatically change the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
&quot; in the section appearance , you can adjust &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part in three parts lower part . &quot;
&quot; in the font section you can choose the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can select documents for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window , and context @-@ brows@@ ers . press on select ... , so you can select a type of font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you own the quota of choice and you can set up your own colour scheme . use it including activated color codes for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; play at the start of the start , that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing automatically with the piece at the point , with which it stopped at the end . &quot;
&quot; the lower Screen @-@ Screen @-@ screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can consider the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . Click to select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box makes shadow that the text in the O@@ SD is shown .
&quot; your own colors will give you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . one click on the colour areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your colors are not activated , the pre @-@ installed &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display text illustrates the text in the O@@ SD . by the input of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set up on which screen of a multi @-@ way monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the select field . some drivers will enable further adjustment in this cardboard box .
the Map Collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; according to music files . in order to include a folder to the collection , check the check box in addition to its name . this section also includes check@@ boxes for adjust@@ ing , as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder : this causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder to music as well .
&quot; monitor : enables &amp; amar@@ ok ; , to monitor the selected files on changes ( e.g. music files or delete ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists imported : does that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists are added to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . later , the play@@ lists will appear then later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part of the collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination @-@ field driver : can you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another option is required in the bottom of MySQL setup . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL device is used for setting the database for &amp; amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : the calcul@@ ator is entered , where the MySQL database is entered , and then under Port : the network port is entered under which the database is available . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established . &quot;
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data used for the database connection .
the box is last@@ .@@ f@@ m setting the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of split pieces to a loaded .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send the split pieces and update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interventions : after activation of this setting is &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ts to each of them ab@@ used . note : you can &apos;t need the list in context @-@ brows@@ ing . note : you need no loaded .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the features and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; am@@ aro@@ K only requires the k@@ deli@@ bs only , and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained in the programs , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be compiled for example modules or scripts . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD is predi@@ cting that your window manager will work to support the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org . thus , Gn@@ ome will work for instance , but we &apos;re trying to use am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can see the file extension to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org , and also hang the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , it is about that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , please try SQ@@ Lite . support for &amp; amar@@ ok . is something sophisticated . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok can be compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . in case &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to crash when editing met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able autom@@ ating machine . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common cause and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is where many program data can write as UTF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but these are not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use _ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; error during writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) &quot;
this script is required the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&quot; you can see the symbol effects in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . however , you can click the status disabled to grey and half transparent . note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol until this attitude will show its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ on symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check whether am@@ aro@@ K can see the correct Q@@ t library . you can see the correct Q@@ t _ gre@@ p Q@@ T with the ld@@ d &apos;@@ _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you possibly need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to custom@@ ize that am@@ aro@@ K will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy yourself at the easiest way through the help of an expert your uni@@ x or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the canal # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only bear a mistake if you have something on the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start window is converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; the importance of these icons have changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; in order to evaluate it , the list of evaluation must be displayed in the play@@ list . Click on the list of play@@ list and select column . Click on the track record for a piece . you can also use the short command @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and press off on your keyboard . or click on your selection , and then choose from play@@ list from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like to do with other files . that &apos;s how simple : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the add @-@ button , click the button play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably you are missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package , and install &amp; amar@@ ok . look again to lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . additionally you will find it about the menu bar below ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s right ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; used a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / x / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty much more thou@@ ght@@ ful audio format . g@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may be ! maybe you &apos;re using Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied without any MP3 decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input &quot;
start the Y@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device has to use a mixer for use . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device for the same time and simultaneously . this can be used by a sound card with hardware mixer ( eg . S@@ B@@ live ) or via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . watch the help mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you by searching for the problem and solution . for g@@ amer you need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. , sink ) . &quot;
&quot; that does &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ coded , you would only hear a white noise . g@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . g@@ amer can display directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs which can cause some playback . read this mistake report . read this mistake report . the enlarge of the sound buffer file . as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts @-@ Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ .@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was heavily optimized for analysis ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less s@@ lugg@@ ish react to visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to remedy it . &quot;
&quot; g@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the g@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ streams , you need to register all components . do you carry out register to register all the g@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the g@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( stop am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download the ff@@ m@@ peg download , comp@@ ile , and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run them back . start now &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; please report about it at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list on suggestions / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;

&quot; thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and release the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player &quot;
this command lets &amp; amar@@ ok ; play playback . make sure &amp; amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will be ar@@ ous@@ ed by the soft tones of the music you will have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to start the current in &amp; amar@@ ok ; ongoing titles if one is on another computer ?
&quot; if a functional SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you inter@@ pre@@ t and titles of the running piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user re@@ usable name amar@@ ok player &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and Ihr@@ us@@ ername with your user name . this assumes that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA is present .
&quot; visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations can be removed from &amp; amar@@ ok ; se@@ clu@@ ded windows . press it on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer in an independent , in size changing windows . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right Mau@@ le is a piece in the queu@@ e sequence in the queu@@ e . by pressing the inputs after a search in the play@@ list the first search result is played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click on the title of a browser window . in the context menu , you can select what browser should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the launch of am@@ aro@@ K , the collection database can not be created and on the console appear many errors . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; if you click the CD , then click on Audio CD menu . open a file browser with several folders . to the normal check , you can select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; this basically fits the prior assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played , the less influence has played every single assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can click the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button in the play@@ list window . here you mark evaluation . then , you can click the evaluation of a piece in the play@@ list , namely , by using the right mouse button and edit : evaluate or F2 . you can change the rating also in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
the developers do not want you to present you when you want to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that can not be merged with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K .
&quot; this is a new function in am@@ aro@@ K , but some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol at playback in general settings . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of rush and therefore caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably it was compiled &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . so the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you must install &amp; amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
now I &amp; amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed but the output modules still does not appear . and now ?
&quot; probably , use a distribution that is installed from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developers are installed . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to re@@ comp@@ ile and install &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;

&quot; the dialog is burning an earlier CD @-@ picture . the dialog ask you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which will immediately be burned immediately by pressing the burning buttons . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burn a previously erotic DVD copy image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source then which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning buttons .
&quot; a previously released DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used simultaneously . it contains information about the read video , coding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . these information are displayed in the content view , and include features of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed is the tool@@ bar currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is crossed , a small glue at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not attached , the status bar is hat@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the folder view shows an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will also appear on the content view . CD / DVD drives have also shown an context menu with functions such as media info , blocking , and un@@ lock the drive or dis@@ card of the media . &quot;
&quot; the content view switches off or off . the content view allows the selecting and drag of files to the projection view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ aches in the projec@@ tile view is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which is only visible if the projec@@ tile has no real function , they only looks pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the key orders for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment to this below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; set @-@ up assist@@ ants . thus , you can set up the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can work general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should be functioning at An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alise and adapt to the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications even , equipped with one &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ Interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command program d@@ co@@ p , or which is somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , that is why your taste and type of task is crucial to give the descriptions of the programs . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be used before you make sure &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then give something like the following in the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ .com Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD ( ) Vo@@ id copy@@ ate@@ .com ( ) Vo@@ id copy@@ ist C@@ d@@ vd ( ) Vo@@ id Le@@ ading D@@ vd ( ) Vo@@ id Le@@ ading D@@ vd ( K@@ URL ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ vd ( K@@ URL ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ vd ( K@@ URL ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project via the command line using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ project using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string , etc . ) Vo@@ id ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) Vo@@ id offset volume ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ .com / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT / / / fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers , which are installed in WAV files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) . additional co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and compressed in WAV files on the calcul@@ ator ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , this WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ist ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this yet is not installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ until ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers are already available . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is not necessary to be used for any Linux distri@@ butions , but if F@@ LA@@ C is not necessary , its installation is not required . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File Format should be used ? the Code Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ader ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to get a protected audio CD ; even if not the mechanisms of copying protection is not possible . simply avoid the mechanisms of copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained on the hard disk to read the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ DB from the Internet or can operate completely without a network where everything is listed manually .
&quot; this is only a short list of commands for the main window . on the page step by step , you will find more information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the program configuration . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request will be available on request from the CD @-@ data in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case it must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a Encoder was configured in the Code &apos;s Code Settings - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the standard . it is too clear that the encoder in the tab tab was configured in setting dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a file can be selected for code selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog box to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ei@@ vers ; with different card cards ( like Encoder , to insert the en@@ code ) . here , you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the correct Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play this files . &quot;
&quot; among audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG today may have a slight advantage against MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ ders are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system , and / or if one of the few existing OGG tuning devices is available . &quot;
&quot; MP3 - When music can also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car audio systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting from resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of one title . good enough for music from juven@@ iles , portable devices and auto @-@ stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments without regard to the file size , then select this attitude . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information stored manually or will automatically be saved from the Free@@ DB program via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names , as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co @-@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ader ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ei@@ vers ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which individuals can read / enter the information up / enter , so that all other information can be downloaded in the calcul@@ ator . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( attachment of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ yl ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent the information stored on the &amp; CD ; but there is no one that can &apos;t be added to the artist nor the music business . all information can be obtained from a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active in a check box ( S@@ end of an address ) . for the use of Free@@ DB can be used as defined in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the server ( this can only know the programmer to check the code . ) &quot;
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ader ; used to use Free@@ DB is to be used to use the present mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and does the load between the machines .
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org gives a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; for information during reading a &amp; CD ; for example , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which les@@ bian program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there is rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who want to be more precise , search in the source code .... This was already the best choice for the reading of audio CD ; see Note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to store the selected WAV files , the coding and the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) can be added to the Code of the Code . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
the coding package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code is required . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . further information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information on its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of installed Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; DVD drive , write and read both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio code of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to give them a hint on what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for example . even if you use other settings , this can give advice as you have to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , read everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for lame can be found as a non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot;
&quot; please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists , and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy somewhat inside to the con@@ quer@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ei@@ vers ; , something that will probably be done once and &quot;
the second section describes the presentation to read a &amp; CD ; which must be repeated for every read &amp; CD ;
&quot; here , we determine the resulting coding for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set Extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with which Free@@ DB can use to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet download . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name will be handed over to the chosen program by reading the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running network . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look inside the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map of general settings . here , there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as shown in the screenshot photo . &quot;
&quot; only for un@@ complete information , you should ask that you will be informed if information is missing for the witness of key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the card Card CD ; simply select both entries . we are comfortable and can download the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet of a Free@@ DB calcul@@ ator .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; with the internet it can be connected to the Free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second select field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , once you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and file entries , you can easily change with the database record and the File Tags , and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , check the selection fields and Free@@ DB file . however , you can use Free@@ DB locally in Off@@ line mode , if you want to use the database before . however , these two radio stations must be selected , at least the first . the mode will be set up on the following card map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server to the internet . how does the system know which data will be released ? read the section on Free@@ DB . do everything as shown in screen image . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at it to a mirror server in your vicinity . on this route the load is distributed between the machines . this setting will be functioning as the first attempt .
&quot; both will work at the server as though , as many fire@@ walls , the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings of screen image . ( make sure the folder / tmp is found on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so just try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this on the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folders for temporary files : if you cross this check , then the path / folders can be specified , in which the WAV files are stored , if only space is available on another drive . if you don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all in such as it is on the screen photo . the command is a little long , under circumstances need to see something on the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the constra@@ int of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) . &quot;
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to codi@@ ating WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; finished . this configuration will be used as standard for each exit of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described how the process of reading of &amp; CD is described in the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ DB file is described , and the process of which is described in this section , must be repeated for each extension &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is still not included in Free@@ DB , the screen photos will see a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully delivered by Free@@ DB . so you will learn the &amp; CD , instead of taking them out of the internet . comments are to be found on the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD is now defined ; in the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD , could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not happening , then search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up from the Free@@ DB , all the titles are already filled and additionally the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key to your &amp; CD ; you can select a window , and you can select the database record in your opinion , best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for automatic query from Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually redeem this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input the CD data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the box in the first line of the &apos; Re@@ box &apos; , the rest of the data in the field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist doesn &apos;t have to be entered in the field &apos; Re@@ box title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for each of the single comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments shared together for all the pieces of CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful conclusion of the data from Free@@ DB , the CD Editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you do not only begin with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with big letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any undes@@ ired comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags in this example . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on which &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ei@@ vers ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the tab tab and set a look in the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later on any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to obtain more information .
&quot; simply select one entry , which is obvious with the style of the out@@ fit CD ; this example is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD @-@ data anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are under rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you see that the fields are already filled with the specified data , which we have already recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all titles of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window will not appear when you downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorting in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected as selected , or select the selection of the piece , or select the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the button , read the reading process , this window appears to be confirmed . OK , then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; Click on the Reiter to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window at the status bar .
this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece . &quot;
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . therefore , check out and coding in parallel . note the status notification in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration settings to express this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used machine with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to be no problem when simultaneously read and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will be converted to a short time in the upper left of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; and you have already enter@@ tain an anonymous package within the &amp; K@@ DE ; but if you &apos;re familiar with CV@@ S , you can already use an anonymous package here . most distri@@ butions have already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ader ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is addressed to individuals , compiled by source files , and do not intended for user to use a compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs if it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step for example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various map maps of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still alive ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked up after the first time of the program , without any point of view as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program is not audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot release this manual . it is as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; thought . if you read this , he has to leave this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; strange when it has succeeded to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others , he did not have some characteristics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ asound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included , as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by pressing the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window onto K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ alls or text events ) . K@@ Mid determined automatically the procedure used .
&quot; meeting support . if you are &amp; K@@ DE ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid starts the same song again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button on the tool@@ bar , select the entry to@@ kens from the menu piece or get the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically , as soon as you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection , and then re@@ play each other . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the speed way . to get the original pace , double @-@ click on Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry break in the menu , so interru@@ pts the playback . use the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tual experience and others use love lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , so you need to adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you will always have the opportunity to change this when you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type , choose from the menu settings and posts or rec@@ alls . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . this section will be played in this section , as you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to put a collection , first open the collection manager . see this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... click New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can choose the desired collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . please note : if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , they must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by adding a song . in turn the file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using file open or drag &amp; drop ) automatically . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the sequence , in which the songs can be played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; add any songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be set new . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list over the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , choose the button Next song , entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song back to jump , select the button pre@@ defined piece , the entry pre @-@ previous piece of the menu , or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter when it is stored at the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that understand the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create an MIDI map which conver@@ ts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always makes a trumpet , when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite dit@@ to ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all the requirements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may seem as often as desired . requirement is , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map file as an email , so that I can in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; for example , the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that are using this instrument ( eg @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which can be similar to a sub@@ sid@@ y . to do this , you can do the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now an MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fl@@ es ) , it accepts patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , in which every tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the tone the pitch of the same drum ( as some keyboards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how to be displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines are very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for every channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sounds at the Per@@ k@@ icks channel . look as an example the supplied keyboards .
&quot; this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to replace the first and second channel , make it easy at CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section thus has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built following the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map option is required to change the name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example , to always use the per@@ ch patch on the per@@ ch @-@ channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which proportion of pitch Ben@@ der events can be multiplied . so if an MIDI file is converted to a Pit@@ ch benchmark , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only rel@@ ayed . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ imal places are being used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard , which should play a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some keyboards up to a oct@@ ave is supposed to play . in order to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use an MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . in this context , you will find in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole number of pi@@ geons ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos , you see which sounds are played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is not more green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the canal view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played tones , view the Settings menu below the dot view : settings &quot;
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down to the temp@@ o , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a binary ( rpm , De@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without any AW@@ E support , you need to download and install the problem ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; understood , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can view the arrow keys from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
&quot; I have open a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop , a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this mode , if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file , or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the window and drag the file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file just quickly , without adding them directly to a collection , you can add the setup automatic adding to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; for example , suppose you have the A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. access you only want to play the first file . so you can add the setting of automation to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these an MIDI file . &quot;
then join the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or postcard I see that , continue reading &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; K@@ DE ; on this machine has been installed .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User mailing list .
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to retri@@ eve the preferred connections under the menu . however , these are individual entries . if you would like to create a list of entries , which should be played after each other , you should use the correct play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional Hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ ch . if you copied a record , his group will be copied and all its sub @-@ groups to the current category , and playback starts with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list may also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / etc / k@@ m@@ player / , can also be changed by an editor , but also by using a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to be chosen out of the menu with play@@ list and select either the user mode , or another category . &quot;
all changes are lost if the processing mode is left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation when starting and end can be disabled by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change of &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml must be observed . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during Star@@ ts does not need to be short , it will be terminated automatically by opening a different source . however , this would be b@@ other@@ ed by the end @-@ animation , but the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the advertis@@ ements of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; lt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; ; in the directory of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory , / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player . &quot;
&quot; there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the dat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ms can be set out of the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this recovery device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ lists . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you can even play the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
&quot; to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the set @-@ up dialog can be specified by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consoles of application , to search for error messages related to the shop of the browser library . if there is no error occur , the back@@ end output within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , a given back@@ end for a specific M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will play : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the device can be used manually or the TV channels can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog to use under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be detected , e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension is to be activated for the X server . this is why the video server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . ) .
&quot; internally they are used by KM@@ Player for sources of different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ et@@ source . if they are activated , they start with the play@@ list . &quot;
is there indications how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from him ( not from the VCD file : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the user to execute the device as root as root as root . so sure / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine starts only slowly , why must my CPU be tested for their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphic user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be taken up to the package &amp; tex@@ tures ; and / or ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the use &amp; Linux ; for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be attracted . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ile ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users have to hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation can be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the k@@ ile ; web site should be made . &quot;
ask questions about or with comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; surroundings for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Work@@ space . offers the possibility to use any &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions for complete , comp@@ iling , editing and errors within the source code and presentation tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to find the manual is to be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter on the editor of &amp; Kate .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right out@@ breaks : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if it is hard to use , a La@@ ie ( English ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros may also be used . a less demanding but more realistic recognition is that it is from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; here it is not the ultimate book to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book about it . for example &amp; lat@@ ex ; such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 &quot;
&quot; as other expressions include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that will be specified as paper format , side @-@ positioning and text gr@@ asp@@ ing features such as paper format , page um@@ bling and text gr@@ asp@@ ing with the command \ \ &apos; . document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a long @-@ term function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the assist@@ ants ( menu ) offers some people for the creation of the document . there will also be some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this is hereby referred to the type of the document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
coding : this is what the character encoding is set . modern systems use increasingly the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the usually used pack@@ ets for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they can only be excav@@ ated in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : document classes of Kom@@ a script ( comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the German text documentation . &quot;
new users are not worried anymore . only a brief description of the functions and further information are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as other source text editor - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is possible to suggest that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is possible to save you through the modest appearance of output files . &quot;
&quot; when ordering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; s { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile , you will automatically generate a blank line ( e.g. \ \ to { command } ) and the added line to close the command ; set ... La@@ Te@@ X commands will be disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . lat@@ ex ; encouraged the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ du@@ ed element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed through a single click on the respective and viewed . &quot;
for the creation of own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI @-@ file &#91; l@@ ayed un@@ lawful file &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI / lat@@ ex ; -@@ viewer to the respective line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI @-@ file contains a description of form@@ at@@ ted document and other information such as the font type and is also in addition to PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ential search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file is cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI @-@ file , the exact opposite is the exact opposite . as soon as a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is cli@@ cked , the appropriate section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ viewer is spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; Master Document : this function is used in the work with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project project can be adjusted for project settings . &quot;
quick construction : the lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and displayed automatically ( if no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file watch : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file is used on the back @-@ of @-@ line cap@@ tion , and it is not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the machining tool@@ bar the three large @-@ size selection fields should be developed . the first radio box is designed for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... Sub@@ mit@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box Show other is for loc@@ ating items such as tags , fu@@ sions , notes or references . these are available : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name is created for a section , a picture or different element . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection field ) .
using quot@@ ation quote is displayed in a selection list with literary entries . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; - files are also written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
&quot; the last radio box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¨ res will be used for the definition of the font . it can be set for the main text , the joints and notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two selection departments are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and capture of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason . &quot;
&quot; the bra@@ ckets on the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the menu or the buttons . &quot;
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for saving the storage automatically .
&quot; if the compilation of the document fails , the log@@ ging of the document should be sought after the errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; a environment ( in English ) is a text that is different than the remaining document . for example , a report with the written documents will have a different font . the command \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; the orders will only be noti@@ fied within the surrounding area ( from \ \ &apos; to \ \ &apos; by the environment } to \ \ &apos; . there is no restriction ( number ) for the disp@@ utes within a environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to illumin@@ ate the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , there are certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either by the command \ \ &apos; or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ News { emp@@ h } : this command is for the shor@@ tw@@ ave pressure and is long as long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a proposition can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; as { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the drawing language is represented , then follow a step @-@ to @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wi@@ z@@ ard a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . in this case , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive print and a poem to the application , to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( on the internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simple try and fun . &quot;
DVI ; is a linear file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ b ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI @-@ file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI you can print the document using printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI @-@ file in other formats . as soon as the DVI @-@ file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; file text , the conversion can begin with the Kn@@ Ã P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the front page allows the direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI @-@ file ; -@@ file . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . this must only be addressed Modern under the settings of K@@ ile ... Tools
&quot; in order to search for the stock , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and close on pre @-@ for@@ ce@@ ability . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewing takes place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; clicking with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ dy and to the respective line . to be specified as text editor ( setting up to ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if using quick construction of &amp; DVI , you do not want to prefer a mistake . should a bug fixes , this will appear in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file extension refers to the error source in the source code . in the editor , the button 1 can always look at the error . in order to consider the wrong line , the log@@ ging file must be cli@@ cked and c@@ ile ; jumps to the error in the log@@ ging line . &quot;
&quot; once you cli@@ cked on the button on the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to choose from the template for the document . the pre @-@ compiled documents are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document may be written either by reason or the assistant to the rapid creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates , can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new model , you must create either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file extension or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings K@@ ile ... settings General . &quot;
&quot; with the creation of its own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables will be replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ - class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard , and thus banned the instructions in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps were completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , its own pattern can be used rather than the standard of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created for creating a template , should be searched after one on the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ability of reading and her@@ ring of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings are made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be made out .
to learn more about it &amp; Kate ; and his friends should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can go directly with reading the chapter on the editor of &amp; Kate .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click navig@@ ates , around the &amp; tex button , which means that clicking on \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when pulling the text with dr@@ illed left mouse button , the text will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , you can easily know the source code of the source code in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to search the various types of source tex@@ tures as well as these results . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants belong to their own stamps . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized automatically , so that they will automatically enter the first input of a sign . &quot;
the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; important functions have been found in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing the following commands are included in the text code :
&quot; if a complete set of lines ( group of lines , on both sides contain an empty line ) . this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines , such as in other text editor ; the only bent thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the result is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the word sp@@ ends under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also a expanded meaning since this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders with a R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ath ( \ \ ) command and a large Star ( * ) command . &quot;
&quot; for a part of a part of the document can be removed from this first , and by pressing the button . &amp; k@@ ile ; K with the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands here . under editing , the following commands are included in the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing sales .
it has already been clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders inferior to work for a m@@ ingly simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command will be spec@@ ulated at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly before the command of the surrounding area .
with this command will be spec@@ ulated at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to close controls .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ &apos; s { environment } is , at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of f@@ ing@@ ed environmental commands , fast delivery can be lost quickly . this command will close the most beautiful surroundings , so that the dirty ambient structure is not broken . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands , which correspond to the environment . &quot;
with this command will be applied to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ amp .
with this command will be applied to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the rolling cl@@ amp .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or behind the shred@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , will be linked to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; during the entry of many f@@ ading groups in bra@@ ckets , the number of signs can be lost quickly . this command will close the last modified group , so that the sp@@ inning structure of the &amp; tex rope @-@ groups cannot be broken . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple training marks are used as a quality mark . for the purpose of the purpose , the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for the end of the opening will be used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; does not know this case and for two locks signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
this automatic influ@@ x of the double printing signs can be set up under the direction of K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be exhausted .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ as or French ) and thus German or fran@@ chise . there are also many more languages available .
&quot; if you want to shift the Shift key , en@@ cap@@ turing &amp; k@@ ile ; if the current position is located within a lists of -@@ ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , you can &apos;t just enter a fence , but at the same time the command \ \ item is at the same time . &quot;
&quot; close within a tables , t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intellig@@ ently enough to support pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments .
&quot; some users can arrange the columns in tables , and thereby arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . if this t@@ abo@@ o is not possible to encourage and k@@ ile ; according to the following tab@@ ulator , it is possible to add &amp; k@@ ile ; for some intermediate space for the columns of the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already offering a good source text content , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three according to need and the other two are available for automated processing . all these modes can be set for different work under the settings of K@@ ile ... &quot;
at the start of a new environment with the command \ \ &apos; s { environment } becomes &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ to { environment } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the button , the last letter of the input will be removed and you can get the processing list . on the other hand , the list can also shr@@ ink the list by entering a further letters . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions will be arranged at choice of a command . alternatively , you can jump to these positions by adding jumping brands N@@ Ã ¤ swi@@ vel jumps . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ile , set ... k@@ ile ; con@@ vivi@@ al att@@ itudes to these lists can be carried out . there are different ways of loading available for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as guidance of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not ready for the processing of environments . it is always a few letters to be entered with \ \ &apos; s , and the call of the processing mode will be so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the processing of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the application mode , the menu is automatically frozen and the key element of the environment will be automatically frozen and it appears \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued and terminated by pressing the input . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list of lists , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; att@@ ile ch@@ ile , set ... k@@ ile ; if necessary settings are made to these lists . in this mode , the processing list of the processing mode is used for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be replaced , custom lists of ab@@ hor@@ r@@ ations , which are set to be replaced by more prefer@@ ring strings . as an example of a ab@@ orted character list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl is used , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word sub@@ jection mode will be replaced , or the key@@ word Str@@ g + Alt empty space , the letter L will be replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character . &quot;
&quot; many of the people are not helpful . however , it was found that many of them will be written in a document more than once . it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the ful@@ fil@@ ment for everyone already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set down in the menu of K@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ fully @-@ handed down . here , the swelling value can be specified for the display of the placement . &quot;
&quot; can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / chest / the Persian Home @-@ folder . mode is available for handling ( remote control ) , dictionary ( w@@ agon book ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; dialogue graphics influences the introduc@@ tory graphics as simple as possible . for ob@@ serving the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but we offer excellent basis for grants and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , then the pages will be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to understand the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all components are group@@ ed in the creation of creating comp@@ iling , creation and creation . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used with Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI file is converted into a PS file , and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the command prompt , a viewer is called upon the comp@@ iling . should not be used to comp@@ ose a new window , each time a new window will be opened . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... Hier@@ in will be asked the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the alignment of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts of scripts in the vertical bodies are managed .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
the first one must be said that the exclusion environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&quot; lat@@ ex ; is a quite clear system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&amp; fix@@ tures ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; are supplied with many documents . they include a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; it is not only a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather it is a full description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is ideal for searching for a certain form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; fix@@ tures ; / tex@@ ex ; it is delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as a personal help offers &amp; even live ; the small application tex@@ tures can be delivered with all @-@ to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and here for a graphic area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are sub@@ divided into categories , and the great advantage is the search for package names , or whi@@ st@@ les . from &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ click on the mouse or the bed of space , you know the viewer for the document . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails , you can create random signatures or daily signals from a list . this command line interface provides signals for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature of the Sign@@ ature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read ; read by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signals , the same signature will be given the same signature from the Sign@@ ature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; for each day you use different signatures , such as the random signatures you create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . therefore you will receive a lt ; blank be@@ ep ; in the lower section your signature will be entered , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file save or click on the disk image . &quot;
you can create many signatures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there is always sufficiently signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select them first and then remove the icon with the red cross in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to set the dialog circuit commands . here you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the right down to the button and enter the new shor@@ tw@@ ave by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
for use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.5 required . to attach Sign@@ atures to your e @-@ mails you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can add the Sign@@ ature text from the output of a command .
&quot; all the recording elements are listed here , the lower the st@@ acking entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;

&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML , tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use compass as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary has been working as well and how it is ra@@ ging it . do we take it another piece , we don &apos;t give it a graphical surface ! simply click on a terminal ; simply click the symbol for XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to be a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in ge@@ ared working folder , then leave the current job folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work@@ men and enter the desired folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when supposed to be started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has been working on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface . &quot;
&quot; if the only file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder , where the inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output in the screen , her file is in@@ correct . please check the correct mistakes and try it again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already selected in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; then , they can easily be attached . if not , delete it with current file the skins and select the file to super@@ vis@@ ing file via file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , they click the well @-@ dependent review . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file selection , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and enter the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; using definition UR@@ I ; using definition UR@@ I ; file selection is necessary in file selection . &quot;
yes &amp; quant@@ um lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
&quot; if you have already selected the processing file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file options using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , to . file will usually be saved in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; but possibly little to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if you need to benefit from the extra functionality , you can &apos;t wait until someone used the desired in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more information can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a box , we begin with the menu plug @-@ in . thus the following dialog is open : &quot;
this dialogue enables to manage all plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in it :
here you can enter the search path . add plug@@ ins without a storage place &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to locate the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often , several people work in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , as well as a Sub@@ project leader . &quot;
the user can look out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ates who he is . this is happening by calling the te@@ amm@@ ite out of the list and express the button . currently selected a member ( their identification ) will be found bold after which you are : text .
&quot; nick@@ name , and setting of their own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information on notes . &quot;
&quot; next to the overview of your team , there is another advantage through the capture of the team : it can be created an event to the team leaders , if something is happening . see in further information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions that are carried out if something has been seen in the project . an example would be able to draw the opening and closing of the project , so that later , if a file is secured , or a script that is secured a file into the CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the mailing list list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see , wo@@ i such ladder can be set up . &quot;
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to give notes is simple . it can either be selected from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary section followed by invitation to text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax of @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby nick@@ name of the nick@@ name Sub@@ project leader according to the enrich@@ ment and sub@@ project leaders should be given as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ name and roles name are independent of major , or small , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages , which is D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ no@@ stic , and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by means of Quant@@ a ... to be called . this dialogue extends over a few pages that will be treated after each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; concerning tags including car complet@@ es can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / Small scri@@ ptions of Tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ roll@@ ment of Tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ reibung means that the tags will be added , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Klein@@ sch@@ reibung of attributes : large / small for@@ en@@ roll@@ ment of automatically registered attributes . normal size / minor damage means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically closing : if attached , is optionally available for tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags automatically , as for all other Tags , except for easy tags . &quot;
&quot; update and closing date automatically : when on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of accent : controls the automatic conversion of acute signs in the appropriate encoding during the typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file open @-@ open files ( where the code of the file can be negotiated ) . this setting is dischar@@ ged from the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected , but this setting is dischar@@ ged from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , creates regular backup copy , so that in a blackout or crash when the program can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for not stored documents , a backup is generated regularly , according to the set time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editor area or a own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code simultaneously . &quot;
set the window settings back to the standard back at the next start is useful if the user interface has come through to change the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on the views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout Command line parameters .
the warning message area serves the Tax@@ ation of Pos@@ sibility to check out war@@ nings by an@@ ha@@ ken of no more .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be specified for symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in the shared mode . see the various modes here .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the structure button . &quot;
&quot; in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des can be opened in the tree , the updating of the tree to work and how deep in a change of structural tree will be set automatically . empty knots are found in the empty areas of the text , while empt@@ ying groups such are no element in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for the fixing of abbrevi@@ ations ( one type of templates ) , which will be un@@ folding in groups , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , and valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are used by third side , which can be re @-@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in the insert of a plug @-@ in must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to plug @-@ in if it is not on a stand@@ alone like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is delivered to the plug@@ in at the start , so the current file can open the appropriate folder ( path of current file ) or the project folders . &quot;
component in the &quot; Only @-@ Read @-@ Mode &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts does not refuse to store when this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ um lus ; if the specified information is correct . select the application also if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ um lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ designed . the support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was adjusted , as well as support for the d@@ b@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of what a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert . &quot;
the usage of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in selection field the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bug is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
&quot; a view , in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . appears usually in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) is shown . usually appears in the lower do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this promotion , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , produced , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ valuation demands . this action is only triggered by default , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger must not be respected in the normal situation . &quot;
the counter to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or terminated the leaves according to requirements .
send a HTTP requirement to the server for a Deb@@ ug request . this is the same with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the implementation of the script and running information on the monitoring variables as well as the current line is continued , the execution will continue . if this happens when the script will start , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without any information to supervised variables and the current Z@@ eil@@ number . if this happens while a script is given , the design starts , as soon as a de@@ coding is given , the design starts as soon as a requirement is made . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next command in script , without going into the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next command in the script , where possible if possible in functions and include in the include . &quot;
&quot; shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to go to the instruction and go next to the next , as there would be the current not . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue in which one variable , or an expression may be entered , which should be monitored . the guarded value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale , like this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find at htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many more works of Keith . &quot;
this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; quant@@ um lus ; to adapt to your needs and you can help to become better .
&quot; documentation pack@@ ets ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for markers and scripts . their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; S &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the brand languages and family 2 , the script languages or and CSS ; S &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool bars ( above the edit window ) , text and instructions qu@@ icker into a document as a user could ever be . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be suspended ( see below ) , downloaded , or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details about conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how day XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . shortly , a &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dialog@@ es , which shows &amp; quantitative information ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars enable quick insert of tags in a document without a risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day folder are not as a folder . you only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . day folder bear the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the tag@@ XML , whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information about the work with them . &quot;
&quot; the following chapter describes any element in detail , all about the possibilities and limits . &quot;
&quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML @-@ document . it can only be found once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains not only element type above itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type of Method . gives the name of the class to which this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
&quot; sets a text in dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag , this is a just element of element . &quot;
&quot; this item describes the attribute of an tags . this item can only occur once for any attribute . additionally , it lays up the name and the type of the attribute . additionally , it contains further tags , describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just element @-@ type element . &quot;
&quot; are the source codes for the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree to the attributes . &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface is used within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name is used within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting machine and a method@@ ology . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . may be empty or % day @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
&quot; specify the attribute &apos;s position within a dialogue . this day can only occur for any attribute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a just element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just element type .
all day XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces don &apos;t influence anything but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start the tools above in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and checked Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , check only takes the check of the daily XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the file name for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a working family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this day XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;

XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; option = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&quot; the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is as quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via D@@ TD @-@ edit D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; version = uses 1 for &amp; quantitative lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD statement . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name . &quot;
a action can be set up with settings . Click on new action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; this promotion is assigned to the key element . by clicking the User button , a key element can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current keyboard can be removed . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the det@@ a@@ ated settings and inserted this text in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or as input ( or parts of document ) , you are the quick@@ start -@@ dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although skilled paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ file variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / scanning / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : in the case of a local document , file will be replaced : / out of the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; executed by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the listed methods , a script input of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be determined at the default setting . in the box input can be determined , which is to send to the default value . possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input , usually only makes sense with this attitude . &quot;
&quot; according to the input , the output of the issued application can also be introduced . there are two types of output : normal edition , on the standard issue ; error messages , which is to be printed with the default output issue , which is set to the default output issue : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool for each group . in this case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add promotions and configure . choose settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action Kn@@ op@@ press at the bottom of the window starts working mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes and you plan to plan , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; edit dialog &quot; , &quot; when available , thus making a input when using the promotion . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; for creating a symbol that the promotion is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ ale ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; using standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose the size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as an los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should be at least to indicate a message to the user ; Click on this symbol a &amp; lt ; start @-@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; according to the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; choose the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button and continue with other tags , so there are still what is there , or confirm with OK . &quot;
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ um lus ; functions for tool@@ bar or should be divided into several groups . open the tool@@ bars in multiple groups . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( above top ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to preview a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the tr@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button on the contrary to the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ w@@ ing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; back in the proper folder . after re @-@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the proper folder , but your tool bar should be stored in the proper folder , so that your tool@@ bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is open from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the script language or form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to like . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document archive for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check your own documentation ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you must first leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . in the first part we will allow you to handle the second . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for this documentation , e.g. or PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = = 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level El@@ ements Top element = PHP 4.2 Case = Table Start@@ ed = S@@ etting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = Basic syntax = Basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
&quot; note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess board ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself . &quot;
note that the table of contents will be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the upper end of the Bau@@ man@@ ners &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ ab@@ files are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed as writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated different context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / AN@@ a / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth , send your do@@ cr@@ c files using a description of important information , e.g. documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use due to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , but they will not be rich in the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quantitative lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the prescribed resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email send , tool@@ bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it and only available if our team needs them as correct and usable for the publication . in order to make a useful contribution , the source of resources are guaranteed , both for our team as well as for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can send an input ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the upload starts . &quot;
&quot; the upload can also upload the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) to upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and can be started in the context menu of files and scripts in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quanti@@ fication of the resource by testing the integrity and significance . in the case of problems it can be broken . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message with the indication of the author &apos;s author appears . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not necessary to work by a D@@ T@@ EP package , but the creation can be necessary but time consuming , because hundreds of day files can be converted into a D@@ T@@ EP package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD store and Conver@@ t to D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative file folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string , which will appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / modul@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
the D@@ T@@ EP &apos;s fine setting after the conversion : if enabled , brings and quant@@ um lus ; according to transformation of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and full benefit of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter tries to create exactly these concepts about , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ um lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area divided into three areas : global , locally and project management . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . from tool@@ bars on actions , everything is marked as globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be found only within a specific project . this can be found with special actions specially for the files of a specific project . all elements are posted in the folder &apos;s folder for the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project options .
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the Bau@@ man@@ ners , the Bau@@ ei@@ vers with Infos and the tool@@ bars . please note in , and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ ei@@ vers with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document archive , such as close to the current , other or all Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites , ski@@ p or upload the document , jump to an book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; editor in the editor area lead to another context menu concerning the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the file under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string is described under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editors of the editor , the tool@@ bars of the editor will be shown . currently , &amp; quantitative lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; if you want to insert into your document , then you can insert the data for this just one day . now , you can insert the data for this just one day ( as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable us to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and cross it . in the representation with ant@@ ei@@ vers , documentation , documentation , attributes and documentation building views are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quant@@ um Nauti@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , up@@ loading or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out with the following context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates are divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the relevant users and templates in projects . more on templates are available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of out@@ sourcing in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to edit , edit or send by mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can view the internal document of the active document . by clicking on the text of an element , the cur@@ sor will open a list of instructions in terms of navigation and design of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among other construction projects . with it , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . that allows the contents of all available attributes with few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . there can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be downloaded from their own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; two cart@@ ei@@ vers at the bottom of the window , can be reached by using the usable information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this box shows information about each in quant@@ a running script . such as the D@@ TD of the current document , and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite displays all error in the check @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will receive the appropriate command . the chocolate bars of tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
a further function of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they are able to secure a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail ; like any other backup and charge !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to understand a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not run here . &quot;
if you have problems at the starting point of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path is the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 I folder contains . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ um lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; was optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide range of powerful features .
&quot; during effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea , which would be if &amp; quantitative Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative lus ; now far in the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you define it in &amp; XML ; it should be used , then the suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quantitative lus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; Develop@@ er Con@@ gregation is not only this possible ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; report it &apos;s not all possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; requires web development to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this allows automation almost every task . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool gl@@ asting is possible . ( more on this , they can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development , and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; associated with the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more details about the details are associated with help : / quantitative a ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quantitative a ) . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changing every time you can open a file , which will not be taken out , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . watch out in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ ferences , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converted to inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , special characters refer to &amp; HTML ; scan , so they correctly displayed correctly and not understood from the browser as form@@ att@@ ing assignment . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; scan , which is the correct way to insert a special character and space character in &amp; URL ; s . first line to add &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day . &quot;
&quot; switches the block@@ bu@@ ds or out . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key . &quot;
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script errors can be selected !
looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; shows the message window , or not . that &apos;s the window , where you see the display of scripts and Deb@@ ug@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; - and switch @-@ off of the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; main sequence . this problem is enabled , as soon as you changes to the structural tree . &quot;
shows the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to start book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if the book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear along with the entries or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position . &quot;
&quot; Bookmark the other documents , appear in the menu after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents . &quot;
opens an existing project of hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog to include files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
search the project directory according to new files that might be there . this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add to the project .
download the files in your project up to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded more / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find details .
downloads a project tool bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only assigned to this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
dialogue to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opening a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by settings . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars and you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the view@@ point . do not extingu@@ ishes it from the hard disk . if you do not have the tool@@ bar yet you will be asked if you would like to do that .
&quot; so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; team , so the tool@@ bar in the next release is available ) . the menu option opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server where any other can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or any someone else made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / auff@@ eur of the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP is necessary , without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is not present and a pre@@ dict@@ ation in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded work@@ places . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
enabled or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . this means that &amp; quantitative inser@@ tion is ref@@ using if this day does not contradi@@ ct the rules in this place .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu entry . please click here . Click on the plug @-@ in plug . &quot;
select the file controller mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ ring schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows , DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application Ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate change@@ over between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can cause some time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains one entry for each open window . with selection of a contract , the appropriate sub@@ window is activated . &quot;
&quot; switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; main window , respectively . &quot;
&quot; changes in this dialogue can be used any application , which use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web brows@@ ers . &quot;
judge the behaviour of the editor &apos;s behavior . in the documentation of &amp; Kate you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete posts from the tool@@ bars or add what to change and to change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the maus@@ oleum , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; it is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory , and should be completed by the top of the project , for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically complet@@ es . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces of the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , one , except you edited local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if possible , this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol is used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default of templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the tool@@ bars for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static we@@ bin@@ aries you can download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ itable scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located anywhere in the main folder of the project , should be attached . if a project started on new , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will appear within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good @-@ th@@ ig@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can choose to select files through check , or by removing the hem@@ at@@ cher , out of the project . &quot;
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also be upload in menu with project properties in the menu profile or with the scanning angle Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( space holder is possible ) which will be re@@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supplem@@ entary option on top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
so the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug can be set up with the button options . in this case the trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described .
&quot; in the bottom @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted as well as the display of a design for the content of the server for each profile , poin@@ ter a own design for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can turn on event actions and add these actions , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a certain event occurs , such as the sick@@ les of a file . see details . &quot;
by default &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is not able to influence this behavior .
&quot; to open a different project , select project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project is displayed and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens if you invite a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project management view provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot;
&quot; file behave like , however , the entries are opening and open with ... in the right mouse button , the context menu : &quot;
here different profiles can be searched here . profile contains information on the site of uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will low to prevent removing the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will keep in the kernel , and remember for programming . this option is useful if common up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the record -@@ option is not in question . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave dialogue , if you need to change your opinion from the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ charge profiles are created , and that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , which should be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name , or an IP address . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; ( locally ) and NFS .
&quot; port for transfer . normally this must not be changed , except the network administrator manages a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your ang@@ ular wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it to your discretion . the password will be saved on the record , so it can not be easily read , but everyone with programm@@ atic results can be easily seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. , through simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replacing the currently open files and tool bars . &quot;
&quot; in the menu project or the project tool bar , can be easily saved or deleted from tool@@ bars on tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own work . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; preferably above the menu tool bars ; use and adding . adding tool@@ bars will be treated below the adding of tool@@ bars below .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set up on the tool@@ bar ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool@@ bar can be carried out , which can be specified in the dialog , which will be displayed on this or other work@@ places . &quot;
&quot; when calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , you will also remove the entries action and working action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with tool@@ bars ... and setting the settings .
&quot; templates are in key documentation , code @-@ escal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates , basically as a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or any at the system existing directory in the stock exchange . templates have applied in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations , which are applied to the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ um lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions before using any template .
&quot; binary is all that is not a pure text . it can be inserted each file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries . binary templates are normally added to the storage space under global templates . further information on the templates are available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . based on this templates , new documents can be created . usually , specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folder . some examples can be found in the previous space under global templates . see also for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents , and you can find everything from a comment on a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . see also for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are serving all websites as templates . you are a collection of various documents that can be organised in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure to popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a presentation of the local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it has been stored as a project location ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage room under project management . &quot;
&quot; in your document , select text in your document and store the selection as a local / project situation . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged to drag and transfer to the building man@@ ners templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a file folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and insert or add over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the file tree or in the project files building man@@ ners on a folder to the right and secure site template , safegu@@ arding a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved as local or global presentation . &quot;
&quot; project management devices permit a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or linked to them . in addition , some things you can keep using templates in projects very profound in the eye . &quot;
&quot; the benefits structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Points / templates / quant@@ a / templates / templates / quantitative files . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to determine the behaviour of a folder , in order to click the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties , the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low , as soon as the ter@@ med attributes can be checked . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folder in advance . if a regular folder would have been set in principle , it would seem to be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
allowed previous or shown text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special header / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the matching head lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; in addition , you are using the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding files or copy and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
it offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; and source text editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it charges a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and if needed for the source code Editor in which the specified changes in the V@@ PL ; Editor is visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavi@@ our@@ al behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is exactly as the first one , except that at the same time the changes in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ous is enabled , this mode is already activated , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ wer comes from a window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and source text editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a . after choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ view , you can choose between synchron@@ ization according to a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is required for fast computers and a large range of range for slow computers . &quot;
suppose you want to change the title of the website as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor possible . the document management dialog is also called as soon as a new document showing the V@@ PL ; editor will also change the following :
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below , e.g. keywords in the column names and key@@ word keywords key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing the picture of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules on the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the work of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing the button onto the file button and select the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sors is as in a word processing , possible by due to the arrows , possible . among rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is beha@@ ved as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or delete a return or removal . &quot;
&quot; the insert of tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is too clear that the inser@@ ting tag is not removed prior to existing identical tags before an anchor day , each other will be removed with text must be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ assist@@ ants are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used to tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining styles . in contrast to other programs for st@@ ills , the search for certain elements can be tra@@ cked and the execution of the style . &quot;

there are many graphic tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time had corrected many modifications at the same time . another programm@@ ers had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the recovery had changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , any amount of further useful features were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , copy it simply into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way assem@@ bling is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently on a piece of co@@ res and change changes . in this editor , you can directly edit the result . in this editor , you can result the result directly . the screen image shows three Qu@@ ell files at the merge : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the precise differences and le@@ aning on the possibilities of current color monitors . if you often have to check out Ko@@ de you will like this feature .
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the bottom of the column on the left side . ( no anger more if no one changes the influence . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in a line , then the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same names , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the typ@@ ing work by using only the file names of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder diff@@ 3 folder diff@@ 3 folder diff@@ 3 folder diff@@ 3 folder diff@@ 3 folder diff@@ 3 folder diff@@ 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
&quot; opening dialog enables manual inputs of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last @-@ opened file from the list . the opening dialog can indicate your selection , and if you have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders , however , is used for B and C , however , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when assem@@ bling , the input field is active for target and process . however , it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
&quot; the setting button opens a dialogue with settings . here , you can set options before you start with the same / merge . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . in the opening dialog you don &apos;t need to select files , you can easily connect the dialog with the break button . &quot;
you can also use pulling and insert : simply pull one file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar to these functions , this would be a relatively big effort . you would need to download two appropriate files , add them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare these relevant sections . &quot;
note : at the moment you can &apos;t pull out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only get out of the text in a comparison window .
&quot; warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the goat and insert text in another program as expressions and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case , your original data may go lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info line is located . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any Info line has a while on the line . then , a small aid window will display the full name . &quot;
&quot; the three source codes are the letters A , B and C . a , the color blue , B is green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one can differ in the color , which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text , the column is found . if differences were found , the column displays the appropriate color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant for the processor and in few , rare cases relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective sources is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison list ) also has a info row with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ep &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved is the save disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next sol@@ ving / un@@ resolved conflict around the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ is@@ ons are used , any difference is to be solved manually at the same time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group will be marked in all windows , and the first row of the group will be displayed in the windows where the group will not be visible in the beginning of the group . this group will be emphas@@ ized with the color background colour for current range and on the left is a black bar . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic merge , or by manual editing , no further line remains in the group ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion , and perhaps another source code will appear either in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you might want to copy and elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; please note ; however , it appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy these text from the results window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources choose these options , or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; this will navigate mainly with the frame and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys , right , end , str@@ g start and str@@ g end , si@@ w how you can also use it by other programs . please click here to navigate to navigation . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button , you can change between insert and transfer mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as described in the section , and the ed@@ itable output window ) was explained . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ ong picture up@@ stream / Str@@ ong picture ) or to the next / previous conflict continues as conflict . therefore , there must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy the copy button and copy the manual copying . be careful , because you could acci@@ dentally acci@@ dentally write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; c@@ eil@@ les are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line log @-@ in character \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line @-@ in switch \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line @-@ in switch \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line @-@ in switch \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line @-@ in switch \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line with bin@@ aries . therefore , you should not use binary files . &quot;
the options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and restored in the next start . ( menu setup - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides variable width to choose from a variable width , but you should not use this . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ic writings are displayed . if the selected script does not support this screen , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but the button would automatically be displayed an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the t@@ aps of the tab@@ ulator button inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator @-@ character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you input or return , the reset line will automatically be used for the next row . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . copy the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ les type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly usual selection in the used operating system .
&quot; in the comparison of files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all full identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs are ignored . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when assem@@ bling , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back@@ drop &apos; \ &apos; r &apos; and a line @-@ in feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then you might save files with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but then , files can be activated with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison . during the merge , this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; the default setting is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensiv after even smaller signatures . the option is enabled in default . it is effectively in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic start @-@ up mode , this attitude will appear as long as the result of the selection is indicated before the next un@@ for@@ ged conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; solves automatic all conflicts in white signs as used by the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need to ignore any conflicts in numbers or comments , if these options are ignored , or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning and conducting a merge . look for details under documentation to the directory @-@ comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version of the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version exists . if already such backup file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , this will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; the language of the user interface is not suitable for the current running program . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and restart , so the change is enabled . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is controlled globally through the control centre . ) &quot;
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option is used for all entries the upper setting .
over the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice that the local code is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
&quot; adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters are treated , and be interpreted as special characters . as encoding for each file can be controlled individually , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can design@@ ate the coding of the output commands . &quot;
&quot; turn off in order to supp@@ ress the changes of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour coded coating column . but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files . according to a selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is displayed next to the normal check @-@ in column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send out the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison with each other or another . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and decide to bring together the files together . current file will merge together when you will only add two files . ( if this function is used to restart the file name , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be delivered first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your needs . you can use this function , e.g. for cutting distur@@ bing parts or in correct use . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be passed first to this external command ( see above ) , then the command of command will only be used by the line processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your needs . each input line needs to have an associated issue line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program requires , and most users want to program this . however , the good news is that sed or per@@ l fully sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to transform the input in large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing control systems use some keywords automatically to include strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of the same pattern will be required for line spac@@ ing : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with it , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command line for line &#91; &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits will be replaced by nothing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you might want to perform multiple shots at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; All dings are different for per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; the data , according to the normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . further operations change only the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ down pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge . &quot;
... makes a suggest@@ ion to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can the merge sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without them truly
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you need to file only folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders will be merged , folder 1 is used as the basis . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will find a small news window about the current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
every file and each folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder structure will normally be folded together . you can view a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the item or by clicking the arrows keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
&quot; when you click on a file , the file will start immediately and it appears to be a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such case the merge operation can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors A / B / C is available in the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders will be considered as identical if you are identical content . then folder the same color . in case of folders the age is irrelevant in its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... a , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. a file and B one file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such in@@ correct objects exist , the merge cannot be launched . &quot;
... a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. a file and B one file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such in@@ correct objects exist , the merge cannot be launched . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders were enabled , and if the option directories have been synchron@@ ized and then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
&quot; a and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select the option of new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date is identical , then the date is not fixed .. Sol@@ ange cannot be eliminated , the merge can &apos;t be launched . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file is shown after the other . you have a status column , if the merge is successful , and according to other messages when the merge is complete , you should see a final review and see if the status is in order everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in set dialog the file compar@@ ative method Full analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ redeemed , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ vening actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a target folder , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C is used as a target and used to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you select a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options indicated by certain entries to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to bring together all entries , select folders / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key pair ) to carry out the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if caused by contra@@ dict@@ ory data types still invali@@ d merge actions exist , a message appears that the error message appears . you can choose a valid promotion for them then . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , sim@@ ulating and break . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see , let &apos;s see what would happen to happen without the really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge into a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screenshot photo ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select folders / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem , or you have the chance to solve another action for the entry , before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually merged , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and performs them all entries in the future . even if this merge is ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as being done . only if you make the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory coll@@ ision with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is not to correspond to this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . there can be more than a pattern be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . there can be more than a pattern be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
ignore files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ em@@ atic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , one file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; in links to files : if the option is switched off , you will be compared to the option if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder would be addressed and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that this option would lead to a final loop and crash@@ es down . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; execute a complete analysis of any file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ for@@ ti@@ ers , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slow as a simple binary analysis , and much slower , if they are applied to files that contain no text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare great file via a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the date date and file size . however , this speed advantage is due to be careful . please note with caution . this option is default in default . &quot;
&quot; similarly , like Confi@@ dence to the date date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to . that can be useful if when copying the date is lost . please note with caution . this option is default in default . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the synchron@@ ization can be compared to synchron@@ ize mode and not a target folder . in this mode , the suggestions for merge files are identical , and the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is displayed in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe that the other file is not changed . ) This option is switched off in any case . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; if a file or file is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option also applies to the default file . this option is switched on . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder mer@@ ges view remains visible to the merge single files ; you can turn off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse menu , turn off the window to the window menu and switch between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . nevertheless , there is also a file menu entry . however , you can use a single file directly to merge without only the folder , and the file will not run once again if you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; this status , however , is lost if you read the directory again : list menu : re @-@ read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are on local or remote computer . &quot;
&quot; the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a file within a compressed archive with local folders . &quot;
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters have to be asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , neutral - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link is shown on a file or a folder . then , a file is assumed as a link . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit , per@@ missions , or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note the option of trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then choose in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part of the file format , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the Patch @-@ File . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch can restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work when the original files have changed since creation of the Patch @-@ File . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or comparison of folders is not supported in part mode . &quot;
&quot; with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now , it is Com@@ men@@ ue ) , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 indicates that the program diff@@ 3 can result in such as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot of learning about the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have gone this way or go to him .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not noti@@ fies the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in default , configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you can find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters differently , these lines will be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as non @-@ white characters . i@@ F similar lines of next to Each other , this is known as &quot;
&quot; the editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . this important information is necessary , if the result is simply saved as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to create extra a separate file format , which could store this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing text , text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ t ; released and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already using many colors to take off , even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . do not use any other editor for this . &quot;
many good ideas and trouble reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
&quot; for more information , such as you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage . &quot;
a list of the last changes you can find under htt@@ p : / / diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folders in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt removal ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or revers@@ al insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board on the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not identical in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you have to read changes to these options the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are indicated that identical files are not already copied to the target folder . if the target folder has not already been copied , they are missing after merge . ( the behaviour is probably not amended in a later program version . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; please note the buttons to choose from the source with the coating A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ shoot in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature show of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the work@@ spaces , to end their size , to end it or move them . this works both within a working area and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop areas as well as the ongoing applications . applications can be selected , and even on the desktop and other moves . &quot;
&quot; with the medium button , window can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement can be moved within a work@@ space as well as other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has also been cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu and the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and end . the commands work the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on full size of work space . appears only if it cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when it cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; in the check box , this check box can be marked within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and other working areas can be moved . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , are displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; crossing this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display numbers of virtual working areas . it is marked together with name , the names are provided with ordin@@ ate , &amp; eg ; 1 . work area . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of all work@@ space is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; indicated . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; indicated . otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the windows with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real programme window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main sequence can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ button , it shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row and vertically in a vertical row , which is very good for the representation of the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the window as symbols or with its contents . furthermore , it runs out outside the control bar . &quot;
Click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting from the switch ... can appear the dialog settings .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must register as user root , or turn to your system administrator . in this file , you need to register the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and have a value . possible values are : &quot;
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base is a functional installation of the K@@ DE base packages .

&quot; &amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended to expand new features . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
if you &amp; k@@ likes ; start a window as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ likes ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following this window is displayed as an enlargement window . in the following this window is displayed as an extension window .
in the default setting up &amp; k@@ likes ; the area surrounding the mouse poin@@ ter like a mov@@ able L@@ upe . alternatively you can use a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter will display in the enlarged window , please refer to the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Maus@@ zei@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; in the selection process mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with arrows and bri@@ ga@@ ze and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button and move the contents of the magni@@ fying glass . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; in addition , use the &amp; Shift key ; touch or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and just move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ likes ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
starts and stops the updating of the ad . the stops of the updating announces that the needed CPU time vs. 0 goes .
&quot; choose the Update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the upgrade rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; automatically uses your introduced short command to store files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document once again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and se@@ per@@ ing &amp; etc . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a single mou@@ sec@@ lick , once the mouse poin@@ ter takes a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive @-@ strain @-@ in@@ jury syndrome ) and of which any mouse click pain . &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a single mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while in the same place . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive level In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . this requires a little exercise .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain when clicking the mouse is created and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can apply to pain that come together with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to create pain@@ s with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by using the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic utilities : the result can be used for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click immediately after interru@@ pt@@ ing the motion .
&quot; the intelligent shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is em@@ ulated the mouse button . so the smart shifts require a little exercise , but you get used to get used quickly . &quot;
this ref@@ us@@ al time has to be spread after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the rotation rate shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after lowering the mouse button , before it leaves the mouse button to get rid of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is now enabled by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this movements will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which allows you to shortened the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; for each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; please note the respective documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings back to the values , which were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset on the status after the final pressing of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the default settings . in particular the smart shifts should be used at first . if you &apos;re used to automatically get used to the automatic mouse , you can later take the smart shifts . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble @-@ click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; in sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should make sure to make a mouse click without effect : the click on the neutral components of windows or in places in browser window that does not lead to un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ eted , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is not to clean the mouse , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you must extract the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you watch the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
if you have removed the ball you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can be scra@@ ped with a flat blade or finger@@ nail .
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interru@@ pts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can &apos;t end more by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use below another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you can run a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue as usual .
&quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor on another spot . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to place him . however , you can &apos;t make the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to make a key cli@@ cks . secure zones for the mouse lines and menus and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart shifting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit the text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is probably possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or to insert any other action . however , here are some advice about it : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart shifts if you just start with it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; set the text instead , as follows : do you hold a mouse click on the other end of the text area and hold the mouse button to the other end of the text . &quot;
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this is going to be played every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is playing a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the smart shifts also without the audi@@ ble mouse click too . but this requires some exercise .
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; should be installed , that should be the case for most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; used the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program was developed for people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome and to whom the m@@ ute pain is prepared .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain period of time , a pulling process begins before the mouse button can be let loose . in this way the goat can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the m@@ ute user to speak to their computer .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , there can be m@@ ute users brows@@ ing the computer . the user can choose from a list of the talk @-@ on sets that are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command to be used later for the language output of text . for further details you will find in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard textbook for password . you often choose text passages , without having to enter . the text passages can be edited naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the word use . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can add the word lists using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , thus only correctly sp@@ elled words into the Wor@@ lds . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly an input field for the keys of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white box in screen photo ) and a run @-@ memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white box in screen photo ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , you can set the phr@@ ases in the input field you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the file memory . you can choose from these sets that are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue contains two boxes cards , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ and and the site K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card voice , enter the command to call the language . in the select field , insert the character encoding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text , if the text will remain unchanged as standard input on the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to speech output from your language generator . this command will be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this you will find in app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; use as a voice service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to continue the text for the K@@ TT@@ SD language service is a standardized interface for speech output and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ word or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ able menu or in the text of text passages . &quot;
&quot; when selecting from So@@ fort , the selected text passage is spoken directly and inserted into the run memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; using the second select box type , you can specify whether the text of the editing guide will be stored automatically . &quot;
&quot; if you select the textbook , the book is stored . if you select changes , the textbook is not stored . choose to save , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text pass@@ able book should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ ate contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , choose the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation one . the frequency of the individual words is simply compare by counting the list . in addition , you can add the vocabulary words with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , to insert the words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask , which summar@@ ises dic@@ tion@@ aries and how these weights are to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ issued words automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text pass@@ ers is two . in the upper section the text pass@@ over are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower section you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the passage or the associated key@@ word . if you select a textbook , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or over a fol@@ dable menu . &quot;
&quot; the sequence of text passages or text passages , you can change with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the field section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the pan@@ cre@@ ers can be selected . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the field section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the pan@@ cre@@ ers can be selected . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the stream memory . &quot;
if this menu entry is attached is a different tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is mounted directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ved left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , is a narrow leg in the lower part of the main window with Hin@@ ts about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not attached , this status bar is hat@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is posted , a sliding table for text pass@@ over with entries will be displayed by default . by mouse click on the shaded left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably , you have not entered the order for the speech or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set ... , open the page General Settings and enter the order for speech output on the voice card output . ( see integration dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language edition of Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and dis@@ semin@@ ate without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently he only supports the English language language . it is currently allowed to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and continue without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language issue , Free@@ T@@ TS is already installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ aks . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following command @-@ examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to send data as default setting . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ eme into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is like the last sign of the text , so an additional sign will be added . the complete command is therefore more complicated than in the other examples : &quot;
( CAT - ; ech@@ o quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data as default value must be turned on .
&quot; the German edition dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language service , which is available to all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems . &quot;
&quot; as the language setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , but depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with people who can &apos;t speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . it is already stored a list of pro@@ xy sets , which the user can always be re @-@ spending . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ on ; - the speech output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is one of modules existing service , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for the language edition ( T@@ TS ) , a joint application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer ready to be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . also users offer interesting opportunities . &quot;
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications is embedded .
&quot; the speech output is done via the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the production of language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
&quot; in the future : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;

an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and set of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for the reading of texts one website or parts .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with a text file completely or partially read can be read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ on ; you can use program , install program , and correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ k@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is shown . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , as well as different males or female , or such as distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer ; you should use at least one speaker , because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various actors for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple pres@@ sur@@ ing long for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the Card Rec@@ ei@@ vers speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card Card is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start a kt@@ t@@ g and yet no present@@ er is set up . &quot;
all accepted speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the most pre@@ dat@@ or@@ ator is used for speech output when an application has no present@@ er .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the sequence of the speaker in the list determines its priority . &quot;
&quot; on one of these buttons , to turn your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System . &quot;
&quot; here , choose a tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ k and girl voice . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , on the new spokes@@ man on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click on . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ on ; you can already use it . go back to the cart@@ ons of Android and check if your language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; K@@ DE will start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text orders to create and manage text entries . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one spokes@@ man , you can start the language @-@ language system by &amp; K@@ DE ; Click on the board map of General to open the card map . here you can adjust some general options here . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ on ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card orders will be given , and you can set text orders and read the T@@ TS system by &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when it is finished , it is running ; further , if the box output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appear automatically at the control area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; starting with buttons in this series , you can start text orders , stop , stop and hold again . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; read the text file or edit a text file . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; clicking on users or OK , all changed settings on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cart@@ ons of the Android and cross the speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you want to read the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ tension and other invisible stamps are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text message . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ on ; then , check the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tools text . then the language output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; you will notify you of your events . you can read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ on ; read the text of this news .
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can inform you different kinds of messages when you enter your nick@@ name , in which your nick@@ name is coming . with &amp; kt@@ on ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text message . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry noti@@ fications of the program settings are displayed in the Settings menu of this program . these are possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; specify a good option in &amp; kt@@ on ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . she removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages sent to the mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in filtering it will be edited text before being sent to the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to avoid certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with text . &amp; kt@@ on ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ drawn , and maintains all other orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings are the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has prec@@ e@@ dence and keeps the output from messages and normal text . these orders will be resumed after the release of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; you are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order , which you encounter from the card orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications where text orders are intended . text entries are intended for issu@@ ing longer texts that have no particular dr@@ iss . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ on ; just one reads , this output will hold and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ws . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text entries as well as &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter editing the text and give it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there can still be more types of filtering .
replace parts of a text by other text . these parts may be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . it is delivered with pre @-@ defined strings written by text or conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
XML ; re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can send orders from the text of the text , depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program , send the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; if you have set a female voice on the cardboard card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it . sie@@ ve . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has controlled rules , according to which he is applied for a speech output . if the filter is determined that his rules does not apply , he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification to &amp; kt@@ on ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filters that are set down on the page below . the process takes place in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be processed from the top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup dialog@@ ues . &quot;
you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a compar@@ ative sample . if this pattern is found in the text , the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and small notes will not be considered as comparison . &quot;
&quot; enter your filter for your filter . you can choose this name , it must be different from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column compliance and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the displayed sequence from above .
Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; once a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the German registered languages . Click the button to hold a list of the languages . you can also hold multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button . &quot;
&quot; if a value is registered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you can use the q@@ d@@ bus program with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be set aside . if , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 is allowed to enter . &quot;
&quot; the string is applied only in the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box di@@ ode filter is applied if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compar@@ ing words , the strings of the strings used in the form \ \ s word \ \ \ s word \ \ s word must be limited both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls package . &quot;
&quot; x@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions , but it can only be installed on your system with the help of X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also enough . &quot;
&quot; with the microphone selection filter you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the Card card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can choose for example , that texts of c@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ on ; a text to the filter , it is looking for a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is chosen to send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is chosen to write the text on &amp; kt@@ ts , and the features of the spokes@@ man for the speaker , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if the text is used here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your System der &amp; K@@ DE ; - Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ating these with one click on the button to get the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to fix the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here , you &apos;ll find the features of the desired microphone conditions here . if the text reads the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to show the desired requirements on the right click on the right to display the dialog radio selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or upload your speaker settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the interpre@@ ting filter is applied only then on the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box di@@ ode filter is applied if applicable . you must apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the speech output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added with the syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing it to use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language issue API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is , you will find on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) . &quot;
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text to read and option is text code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you will give .
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole . open window . start to kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ converting filter , but when using the module for festival , websites are not pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 , you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so S@@ able is able to do at all . if you don &apos;t need to read this voice at all , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
certain signs or interfer@@ on signs appear to cause bugs when syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that whole sets will be ski@@ pped or just Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ?
&quot; initially , make sure that the character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed through a string bi@@ directional . see . &quot;

&quot; the language syn@@ thesizer which are used by &amp; kt@@ ops , have their own license that you will find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it in the folder . besides , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ g under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with every language syn@@ thesizer which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , please refer to the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops , according to information that are not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want &amp; kt@@ on ; for use of any other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the Develop@@ er team in conjunction with the Develop@@ er team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ cs or have downloaded tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you are using &amp; on ; use , check first if you use your voice syn@@ thesizer with your language syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , used by the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be further developed that the dec@@ or file extension is no longer required , and the SPD @-@ conf script is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed in single sets . the user can withdraw parts or ab@@ t , repeat , release , or ab@@ rupt output . &quot;
&quot; if you have an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have a spokes@@ man , this is used , otherwise , if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ on ; you will be selected as a speaker , you can see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Card Card speaker , and then click to insert a speaker into the list or click on editing , the Card card device is displayed . for example , the setup of the module for festival Interactive is shown . details about the modules will be found . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the detailed festival program . when the path comes to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; choose the text encoding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ on ; it is noted that Western languages will use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; using these sli@@ ps , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t select a few regulator , you can &apos;t display these grey settings that you do not choose from you . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded after their size . when using this check box , these voices will already be loaded when using K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you do not have any spokes@@ man ( or forget to click on application ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked in the box window . otherwise , after start@@ up , the program window will be displayed , but not the program window . Click on the symbol in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system range , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . in this way , you have the opportunity to stop or control them otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in the waiting period , together with the application that put the contract , the current status of the order , the number of sets and precisely worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can go to the order which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the board card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text entries are listed and administ@@ rated . Edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws , War@@ nings and News are not indicated . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled , either without support for the appropriate audio module , or longer ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules can be displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . do you choose the PC@@ M device here . see also : &quot;
&quot; make the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal speaker speed . thus , these settings must be implemented , the program SO@@ x must be installed . &quot;
&quot; in order to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops , click on App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA equipment includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system , most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text order from a message is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts : &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ drawn , and maintains all orders . after the issue of the screen reader has been read , the orders received . &quot;
war@@ nings are the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output from messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are writing , you can welcome a long text on a website , you can welcome someone with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome the space . &quot;
&quot; if a message is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader pause , add &amp; c@@ ts ; the audio output to the queu@@ e one . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played , when a normal text order is interrupted , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this cardboard card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws there are no particular actions , if these are interrupted by a higher priority . &quot;
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages release and click on noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications will be published .
mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , al@@ erts , in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message ahead , the conversation ; sends when someone menti@@ ons your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else specified , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ on ; to do if an event takes place , you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker . default choose the speaker which is shown in the list on the Card card speaker as top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event is specified for a specific application , this is executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the specific application is executed . otherwise , the action for carrying out the action taken under standard ( all other events ) has been specified . &quot;
the event all noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this reason you can design@@ ate the above noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button Save to store the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button to store stored settings from a file . when you want to begin with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for the control of voices , the speech speed , the volume , the sound of the voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only supports and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you have to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used at the SS@@ ML issue . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . so that &apos;s only the first set of syn@@ thes@@ es can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the first set of syn@@ thes@@ ize , not the whole text order . thus , if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you will be automatically set up as a pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter . you can change the settings , or further pun@@ ctu@@ ally recognition filters , but will be rounded off . &quot;
&quot; easiest selecting and check out the device of speaker selection . if you select the speaker selection , please check out some features and check out how the speaker selection has been set . for this reason , you need to check out more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ on ; then you can start faster with the pre @-@ reading , as only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
you can then stop text orders then on the card orders or break down if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ M for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed from this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; the text of pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ stit@@ utes and add a tab@@ ular character ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limits are automatically removed from the text , before filtering through the text . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filter will never be used on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ caps ) , war@@ nings , messages or the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter , you can add this back by clicking the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ on ; included in the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card reader selection , you can review the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the board card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker characteristics .
&quot; use of the appropriate speaker , which has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t need to delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings ; otherwise , it cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker consists of , the most originally introduced properties . &quot;
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; here , choose the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box , if the property is intended to have in front of other features . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , this feature is always treated as a pre @-@ level property . if you want to specify the attribute language , it is the only case if you may know that a specific application text in another language is sent than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all properties in the speaker , which is equivalent to the default button , click on the selection button and then apply to the speaker , which corresponds to the below . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text order in the waiting period . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t receive tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ da@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ on ; it was finished yet . probably , you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may not have any compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install g@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I have a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . hints for possible solutions you will find at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org website . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded a voice from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / public@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices will add the new voice . when this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ x is installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ os such as festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the microphone speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very brave , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML replacement filter , and put the speech speed up . &quot;
I don &apos;t create the websites with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ on ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so the festival does not produce any mistakes , the X@@ SL file raises the conversion of SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I added an own drawing filter , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ on ; no more sat@@ in or return . on the box orders orders , the order stand only from a set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; sign of interest ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one ) may not allow you to filter for this character instead a filter to set detection detection . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )
&quot; please note : get registered in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note that the modules are registered for G@@ streams in &amp; kt@@ ts , by using G@@ stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ on ; command the mailing list . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system is also part of the audio output . if your system is also part of it , you can not play music simultaneously and start a text . &amp; kt@@ ert ; free@@ zes one if you will find a text order and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de hasn &apos;t supported any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ on ; the current set will still be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program SO@@ x is used for the general setting of microphone speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included . &quot;
&quot; you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar , packed archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball in a suitable folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed , or at least on request only . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running @-@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the code of the de@@ coding ) , the configure parameter indicates the configure parameters , which causes the transition &apos;s transition . &quot;
&quot; as default , it is installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ on ; use , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer properly works . follow the instructions you have with syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . among many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . would you like to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices will be subject to limitations . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to set up for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a c@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually found in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions for distribution . therefore you are looking for the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as an example of KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; syn@@ thesizer takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ es analysis and mb@@ rol@@ a ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; designed to manage the network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center can be accessed by K Menu bar . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allow users to create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module option is displayed in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displayed . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network Network Settings in the &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been able to function and configured to enable &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is shown at all and setting the network characteristics .
&quot; in most cases , drivers are used for the network hardware and other devices on installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed network appliances later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded , if the option is selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index . at the starting point of the module , this is trying to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the suspended choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release date . by marking the setting non @-@ again questions can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pre@@ set automatically . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings are possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing the button mode at the right bottom of the module mode . it is necessary to enter the password mode . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the module &apos;s total functionality is available . these are divided into three riders : &quot;
&quot; the rider network interface serves to manage the networking of the system . all available network devices will be displayed , and all available network devices can be carried out in the following tasks : &quot;
the settings attached network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button and click on the dialog .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . Click on the button , click the dialog with further features . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic selection , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address will be set to the system with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is not necessary . in the select list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manu@@ ally , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be set up the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the network net@@ mask is required . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alized the system interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialogue are displayed as the properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . you can notice if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching to a network device is done by selecting the list and click on the interface ...
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , or activate a activated network device by selecting the list and click interface . &quot;
&quot; set the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which is convey@@ ed to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if your computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete list of domains by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address like approximately 12@@ 3,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for a name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ er name solution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a contract and execution or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons , or can be arranged in priority . &quot;
by clicking the button adding ... from the group host to name a DNS server can be added a DNS server . the dialog Neue Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver is displayed .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group host to name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button . it will display the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks may replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains some entries which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will still be able to replace them in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click on adding .... The dialog Neue alias is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known machine and add the button . if the well known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias name , de Button add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select one entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialogue of acquain@@ tan@@ ces is displayed .
&quot; it can be implemented one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings listed in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm @-@ packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and in a console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical surface such as c@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE does not sufficient for this case but also uses the development policies with libraries and other things . &quot;
this will only be experienced users recommended . however it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands should afford this .
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic networks systems are given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; amended configuration files . &quot;
this area can &apos;t replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . for example , 5 has never seen great spread . from IPv6 , it is expected that it focuses on the spread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface is required . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ administrator is the response administrator , which is a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address is not easy to be selected . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , IP address should be chosen from a specially designed area to avoid IP address files with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , hence its any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks and 250 host . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , configuration files located by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; are affected and where they are dis@@ car@@ ded in the various districts . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised when in the case of active DSL connections to find another content as defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can be reached as expected . &quot;

&quot; it is a bug program for band@@ ages on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar . the first goal was to ask a question that my wife asked : how much longer it takes , when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be attached by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen on three ways : &quot;
&quot; and dat ; trained the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the incident on the band will not be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the Vor@@ os@@ ann , is looking for the appropriate index on your record . can &apos;t be found , you are asked whether the band index should be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changing the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar it appears a corresponding message . the content of the band can now be searched for the entry on the tape . &quot;
&quot; before setting out the belt , first must first be solved . there are three methods to do this . &quot;
&quot; by a change of symbol for the band , there is a message to the tape that the integration process has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be kicked off without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a belt types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use data format . this process is not form@@ at@@ ted to form@@ at@@ ted with &amp; k@@ dat . however , your tape drives usually needs to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; however , flo@@ ppy drives usually do not have any form@@ att@@ ing of the tape , DA@@ T drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape . all data on the band will be lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the tape will be integrated automatically and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the secured files . this can happen on three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or the file is secured .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
&quot; mark files in local file tree with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured . &quot;
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select in She@@ ol menu ... &quot;
&quot; once backup was introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . dialogue displays the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; mark a file or file in one of the archives , for the drive . only the selected file or the file is checked . &quot;
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for tape . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
&quot; with the right mouse button in one of the archives , click the menu entry .... &quot;
&quot; once the test process has started , the dialog settings will appear . in this dialogue , you can check out your selection and change the job folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can slide it , the files must be restored , which are to be restored , this can be done on two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder is restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ k@@ ets . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are restored .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the restoration process has been started , the dialogue settings for restoration . in this dialogue , you can check out your selection and change the job folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to re @-@ establish dialogue . this dialogue shows the progress of recovery and data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types from the band :
this is a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for ensuring the following settings :
&quot; the current work folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of c@@ auti@@ ous files is automatically updated according to the chosen folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under the backup files , only the files contained in the same file system are such as the folder . folders that are located on the same file system , you can use separately under backup files . every entry will be viewed by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last in@@ cre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be saved . only the files saved since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used for fixed changes since the last in@@ cre@@ mental f@@ use . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot files before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can setting the settings on the menu entry ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ efer variant of the belt radio device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ itting &amp; dat ; before the tape is bound to load the drive . in some drives , this is necessary to read the read or write operations . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries to lock &amp; k@@ dat ; the throw at the tape drive . possibly , this attitude does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , it will be kicked off at the soldering side of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use this option on Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ side block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is form@@ at@@ ted , there is a file at the beginning of the band . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file sets itself as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is : seconds , whereas host name the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been form@@ at@@ ted since the period since the period was form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which are directly related to &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not an incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is bound .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewing for system protocols . the program is for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system , or where the system allows information about your system . an experienced users enables quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users where you can not know where you can collect information on your system or where the system files the different protocol files .
&quot; moreover , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information on their server , which can appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide certain extended functions , which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
&quot; support for many different types of protocols , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g Ser@@ vers and Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included in addition and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are provided with their help , the individual protocol lines can easily filter and sort out . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual page . &quot;
&quot; after start@@ up &amp; system we@@ blog ; initially the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open it . if you don &apos;t have a small message window , you will normally have a small message window , so you don &apos;t have any PC with system wal@@ ter@@ right . the protocol files normally don &apos;t have any permission to read . &quot;
you can also use the filter bar in order to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the specified string . in the default setting it will be displayed next to the selected filter . in the default settings the box line will only be displayed if in one of the columns indicating the filter search term .
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search , then select the column process only . for example , in the protocol file boot , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all the protocol lines , which were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a stri@@ cter color as a protocol @-@ lines of the Stage Note . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to display certain process only ( for example , in the protocol protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command such as the Start of Sam@@ ba Ser@@ vers . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new upcoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ cut@@ ters . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage . once you select an under@@ window , select a protocol for displaying the menu . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum software softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the reference sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .

&quot; welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; do . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system quickly developed to the standard for control of the start @-@ up of the system at high speed of the system in the &amp; Linux . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go on historical aspects here ( e.g. I know about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it bin@@ der file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to adjust a machine on System V In@@ it without any re@@ installing and new format . therefore , you &apos;ll be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it diff@@ ers from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . there you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start running the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should turn under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if it does not want much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ between / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see line as one line as the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ installed run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can fix / etc / in@@ away from hand , then you can repair it by restart the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the correct scripts begin ? if you enter l -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you may see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does it start and stops system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it &apos;s an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would keep the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will be called to the argument . when he includes an S , the script will start the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set out a simple way for setting machines for many purposes . I could go &amp; eg ; a server running , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say tri@@ vial : simply pull one entry from the availability of the availability system to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can change scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within a level by taking it elsewhere . in doing so , the entry will be removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of availability . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved , if you want to copy them into a new range . to copy it only to a new run@@ level , you must expressly select copying from the menu Edit , and add to the destination menu -- even then , if the same entry was already in the target range of action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be charged . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the converted entries before you can attempt to insert the system services . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries in the tr@@ ash basket . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab button to enable the various working areas ( dispos@@ ing system services , lap 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of upper and below . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , turn it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or name of a entry manually , press the button key to change the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to accept the properties dialog , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of loss loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise it will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; at the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single one and press the input key to start in single @-@ use mode , then edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have set some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary components of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without any message if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save this . either you use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bar or entry into the File menu . &quot;
&quot; user interface is a simple application . the main window is made up of two boxes , user and user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards will only be displayed if you have expanded system settings . only if you want to make limited system settings , a box map is generated , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xen . &quot;
&quot; the card password appears , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xen . &quot;
&quot; this card card is only enabled , if it is activated and initi@@ alized for at least a built @-@ in file system limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) . here you can change parameters for any user parameters , whereby the limited number of limitations in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field file system .
&quot; the card groups inform groups of the selected users of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by replacing these in the big field . &quot;
dialogue features of the group contains a list of users . to add a user to the group you will mark this user in the list .
&quot; to add a user or a group , select adding from the user or group or click on the appropriate add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . working or delete the selected user or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the li@@ lo Boot@@ Manager , add the boot password , remove and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
