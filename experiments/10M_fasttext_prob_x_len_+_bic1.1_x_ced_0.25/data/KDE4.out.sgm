<seg id="412">"the intensity controls solar control. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible is possible. another increase is created, finally a negative image that is not available on Fotopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect effect. the original image is (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrast effect that makes colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one to daylight, produced color film from the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture photographers. Velvia offers strongly saturated colors, especially to which the hardly any landscapes are undergoing."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight to the contrast ratio. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shale repetitions the strength of the neonlights. in large pictures the filter can get the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color-color and luminosity of your photo using the tools in the menu. once you are happy with the result you are using the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a great choice for brightness / saturation can be a good choice for saturation. all changes you can do in the preview. if Him do the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tools Gradation and the simple Leuchstrength / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve exposure. even if the dialog appears to this tool very complicated, you need only the field of slider. specifies the three sliders below the history program."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, of the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are placed in the inside and the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digicame; introduces three different tools to sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"unsharpening mask works on the contrast of the edges around a picture of sharper. actually, it's no bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to avoid atmospheric Dunst and makes it a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"probably the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application, and has various parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus and most digitalised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is the smaller than the resolution, meaning that sharp edges will be printed together with a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more retrospectively than normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at JPEG pictures, a camera is commonly used in internal sharpening. images in the base format must always be sharpened in the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners apply a sharpened filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with sharpening agent. this allows you to deal with the menu entry to Corrigging sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should hereby be careful because the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, you can focus on the sharpening technique. in general, you will find further information and comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes, you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crispy. the solution to draw a bit soft is much easier than it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry, and experiment with the settings. the advance window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview can help the image process. the front window shows the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate often good results and should first be tried first. an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect. if you make the unsharpened mask to make noise, noise and impression of grass close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius presents like many pixels on each side of a cannon by the filter. high-resolution pictures allow larger radii. they should therefore sharpest pictures best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired picture one which is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the necessary difference amount. it can be used to define a minimum difference for a channel of filters. in this way, areas with a soft shift between the potions are excluded from the sharpness of sharpness, Himmles and water surface."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the insharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the revised picture (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a wellbeing = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocus refocus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected unprotected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to stimulate a picture of & quot; refocussing quot; in which it is a better approach to sharpening the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Viennese Filtering. it is using a technique called FIR Viennese Film. it is using the use of an unsharpening mask. you can start using the menu by using colors refocus on editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular wedge is much better than the Gauß's fade. the Gauß's Flap has a very long tail, which leads far from the source pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse is also influenced by the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the most important parameter for use of this module. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most images, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set up a higher value, but if your picture should be very sharp then you should pay attention to Heiligendamm."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: increasing the correlation can be reduced by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharpest effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can be reduced to you. the filter can accept values of 0-1. however values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low; the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will continue to decorate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your imsharpness use it. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. in most cases you might also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrimal size: this value determines the size of transverse material. an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any reproduction parameters have set you, so it will be saved for later and then can be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, color, and intolertions on the image before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture. for this reason, the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible that left unpleasant Artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"to read and read images, eg; eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masked produce better results than sharpening. this might be caused by doing so sharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, no sharp masked needs to produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never be able to remove the effect of the nub filters. practically the result of the FIR Viennese Filters is always at least as good as the most common mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better with the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocussed picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color picture has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to unsufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about methods for sharpening methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator is the unsharpening of the area of the dark, in order to generate more natural Pupille."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour tinte allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Invoice Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"in case you want to adjust the filter settings, you can also use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"details [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glass beyond the image. a value of 0.9 should be given that no sharpening is necessary. please note that there should be any sharpening if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="520">"configuration dependency alpha [0,100]: a small amount of smoothes evenly across all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a high level of similar patterns, JPEG Artefacts will be best possible at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above allass. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value for the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned with larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more becomes smoothed. this is necessary if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually this is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle gradual length [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is being selected, there should also be small for a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixel. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing, and never get bigger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the quality which you receive by selecting this option is only small. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons as and store are exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be correct in a text file and later to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors correct is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button break.</seg>
<seg id="529">"below, you can see how image error has been corrected using Small Artefacts. the module is used in a photo that was created in Guatemala city with an analogous camera. as you see there is a unique black artearact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiants came; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce billows. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moirees; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensations of digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the underwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be smoothed by the radius given the picture and the color in it is smoothed and caused smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch to adjust the filter to the front. if the value is high, you may need to re-adjust the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details will not get more and sound or lubricate again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, you can't remove the entire noise or noise tips. put it on a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you either change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoother process through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoother process through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gammattolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically perverted more strongly, however the shadow of shadow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the alignment of the Phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is responding to variations of the luminance. if he is lifted up, glaze and phasenjitter can appear on the edges. he can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save and store: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution, the image is a bit soft, it is thankfully easier than a picture to use the menu to create soft softshell and experimenting with the glittering box. the advance window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digians; Foto restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artworks.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grains, scratches, compression and retrospectively digitalised pictures. the smoothing occurs in digital, original or retrospectively digitally digitally digitally."</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. the text replacement is developed with another tool which was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannas and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the JPEG Artefacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas too. as a loss-loss composition & quot; - small standards that are shown in the uncompressed image. this attitude shall correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons save as and store exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved in a text file and later to be loaded.</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray runs a ray per pixel. if the difference between the dye values to the neighboring pixels, both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the lowering value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25)."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1-r 2) + abs (g 1-g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be further pursued and checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. when you turn Jittering, changing & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1651">"the temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter when it is stored at the leaving of & kmid; not saved."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translates into events that understand the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create an MIDI map which converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in the type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always makes a trumpet, when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have one soundcard, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (using your favorite ditto)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all the requirements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may seem as often as desired. requirement is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... End Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end, that the end of a section is reached."</seg>
<seg id="1660">"please send me your Map file as an email, so that I can in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, as the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"for example, the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that are using this instrument (eg-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which can be similar to a subsidy. to do this, you can do the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now an MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (rifles), it accepts patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, in which every tone is a different percussioning instrument (drum, cymbals, Maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the tone the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how to be displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines are very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for every channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds at the Perkicks channel. look as an example the supplied keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to replace the first and second channel, make it easy at CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section thus has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built following the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap option is required to change the name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the Forcepatch option can be useful for example, to always use the perch patch on the perch-channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which proportion of pitch Bender events can be multiplied. so if an MIDI file is converted to a Pitch benchmark, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only relayed. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no decimal places are being used."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard, which should play a Pitch Bender event with the value 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards up to a octave is supposed to play. in order to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a little bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use an MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. in this context, you will find in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the channel view is a window with a whole number of pigeons (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos, you see which sounds are played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is not more green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the canal view (up to now) has two different views to display the played tones, view the Settings menu below the dot view: settings"</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down to the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have compiled a binary (rpm, Deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without any AWE support, you need to download and install the problem (for example from kmid; 'page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"understood, therefore supported & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"in advance, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can view the arrow keys from Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have open a & KDE; -Desktop, a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this mode, if I want to play a karaoke file, or I want to play a file, only in the & konqueror; drag the window and drag the file to the window of & kmid;"</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you want to listen to a file just quickly, without adding them directly to a collection, you can add the setup automatic adding to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; viewing for system protocols. the program is for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system, or where the system allows information about your system. an experienced users enables quick access to information about problems that appear on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer does in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files. the program is suitable for inexperienced users where you can not know where you can collect information on your system or where the system files the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information on their server, which can appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, attempts to provide certain extended functions, which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of protocols, for the format of Syslog Servers and Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are provided with their help, the individual protocol lines can easily filter and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual page."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after startup & system weblog; initially the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open it. if you don't have a small message window, you will normally have a small message window, so you don't have any PC with system walterright. the protocol files normally don't have any permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar in order to filter for a selected criterion or according to the specified string. in the default setting it will be displayed next to the selected filter. in the default settings the box line will only be displayed if in one of the columns indicating the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search, then select the column process only. for example, in the protocol file boot, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines, which were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a stricter color as a protocol-lines of the Stage Note. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display certain process only (for example, in the protocol protocol or in cron protocol), you can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command such as the Start of Samba Servers. in this case you use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new upcoming protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate subcutters. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage. once you select an underwindow, select a protocol for displaying the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum software software.org. Dort you will find more recent information about the reference sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; found in the following folders of the & KDE; Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; im & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv; do."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system quickly developed to the standard for control of the start-up of the system at high speed of the system in the & Linux. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (e.g. I know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binder file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to adjust a machine on System V Init without any reinstalling and new format. therefore, you'll be sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. there you will find rc.sysinit and following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start running the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls belong to rc.local. "</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should turn under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if it does not want much use for it. you can also run a rc.between / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered / etc / inittab. you should see line as one line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the pre-installed runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can fix / etc / inaway from hand, then you can repair it by restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the correct scripts begin? if you enter l -l in rc3.d, then you may see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stops system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it's an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script will be called to the argument. when he includes an S, the script will start the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set out a simple way for setting machines for many purposes. I could go & eg; a server running, which can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say trivial: simply pull one entry from the availability of the availability system to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can change scripts also between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by taking it elsewhere. in doing so, the entry will be removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of availability."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved, if you want to copy them into a new range. to copy it only to a new runlevel, you must expressly select copying from the menu Edit, and add to the destination menu -- even then, if the same entry was already in the target range of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be charged. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the converted entries before you can attempt to insert the system services."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries in the trash basket. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab button to enable the various working areas (disposing system services, lap 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of upper and below."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, turn it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or name of a entry manually, press the button key to change the properties dialog. use the tabulator button to accept the properties dialog, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of loss loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are stored in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise it will be saved by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>

<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the species, such as system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for proprietary components of these distributions, but is unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply without any message if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so this manual can be added."</seg>
