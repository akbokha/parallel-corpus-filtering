although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors and run his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had become such a profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ Student , who was the Supreme Court with judges who were his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that &apos;s the absolute truth , everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only intensi@@ fied my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you are always who you are and it is easy to find in a community of equ@@ ating people . &quot;
I even had a very shy love letter concerning his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded . &quot;
&quot; he never stops behind the mountain , how to say so nice . &quot;
&quot; he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague it express it , and publicly declared its cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes that he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ otte person , asked me ? &quot;
I was able to bring Tr@@ ump and his voters not in line with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic , people from all over the world , was a deeply believing man , with whom I was talking about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps was also voted by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; at the game .
&quot; tr@@ um@@ ps int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues , to acc@@ use us to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those with them em@@ bodies my love toward America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump in his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe due to its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either by rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost the heart broke me . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to signi@@ fy the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as rac@@ ist .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; that is superf@@ icial and respec@@ tful , and suggests a in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations will not be considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most know are , for tr@@ ump voted because they want control over a country , which they dis@@ ap@@ point ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look like . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( d . ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; vocabulary from white in an@@ em@@ aking on the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what exactly does the big Van Jones called , exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like to have , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with complexity , religion and the entire concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man is back in the silence , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd of human beings . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd w@@ aked . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if anyone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a consistent and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan joined the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the park in Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places is not only changing the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
&quot; music , living with the tr@@ ash &quot;
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular with tourists , but worlds away from the nearby presence of prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the community : one of the children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments , have found an opportunity for over@@ coming poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drugs abuse and gangs . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots which started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hopes . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from W@@ aste
&quot; more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically speaking at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city , on instruments which are made from recur@@ ring waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , consisting of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycled under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments must read violin , viola , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ av@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , is reminis@@ cent of : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as a f@@ avi@@ o thing , which he never had seen before : a violin made of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and called the Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who are with him and of him are the off@@ ences - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectac@@ le from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can combat illegal fish@@ eries successfully .

&quot; this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that the ship had been using illegal fishing in the Liberia waters before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the East African countries were thus up@@ set up and slightly incl@@ ined to welcome a criminal criminal of this kind in its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobi@@ lized the ship quickly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permits . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; remembers Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the ken@@ ian fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region . it was not succeeded to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practition@@ ers crossed and protect resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that the Prime Minister had driven out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; so we have eight countries that are sp@@ inning and work together . they change information and stand in each other way where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by the definition : what is caught , is hidden , absent because it is extremely difficult to rise . this is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing . &quot;
&quot; due to the obvious cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , which are to be protected by certain habit@@ ats and types , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may have damage , which have a delicate equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once again have been disabled by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the information between different countries , the actions in real @-@ time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; you can exchange the individual countries , e.g. lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very carefully , if this move on the open sea , with satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , so susp@@ icious driving routes - about such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in ide@@ ality , such studies may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can be denied on the basis of these information then the adoption of such ships can not be sold in their ports . so that they could not be sold to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it then concerns significant financial losses for the owners , meaning that the illegal fish catch is not worthwhile anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , head of director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a non @-@ governmental company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed Front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to receive an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , who lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate the East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has made one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , especially to attract the region commercial fishing in all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; among other practices include actions , such as sailing under false flag , fake licens@@ ing documents , indication of ph@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ bridge organised control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship was illegal and a country could say &apos; You must not go on my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal si@@ p@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
so far the closed front work .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 examinations susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; it has exposed crimin@@ als being uncovered , distributed by counterfeit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it persecuted ships and found them . &quot;
&quot; based on his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for fighting crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing via large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far in the networks of organizing crime &quot; , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that is designed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships more precise . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed , also helps to send illegal ships to hide themselves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO which is also concerned with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be used by satellites . &quot;
&quot; cop@@ eland , therefore , helps to build a system that combines different information on each other . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to help discri@@ min@@ ent ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Marine Protection Agency Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed as a single tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who is doing where - this makes simply sense &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and protect their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities can not only feel crimin@@ als but also deter them .
&quot; ships , who used earlier without a license are conf@@ is@@ cated and hardly to calculate with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats increased by more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to send Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board to@@ wing nets , whose deployment is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that we can also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object in West Africa every year , among illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries gathered together for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to have more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to announce his first major triumph in Somalia : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and have been banned by to@@ pp@@ nets , which are now forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also contained in the prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative working way to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world of the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

they apply to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the President of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela &apos;s proposal had rejected the request of opposition to a referendum , the Vene@@ tians , in whose sight ran the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country by taking them on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments are found for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central area of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medication noticeable .
many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance of fundamental change in the administration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . however the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government &apos;s context in its latest article : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to conquer the country &apos;s institutional structures and to close a new government bund@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ al measurement of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) concluded that the protest@@ ers were to join the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . in addition , the proceedings against the President of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was planned to continue to continue the proceedings of the referendum on 3 November . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civilian strike , and on November 3 , all in Caracas to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; The withdrawal of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the march that will be published in real time , amongst others an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently divided images shows a demonstr@@ ators , who calls through the prot@@ agon@@ ists : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;

&quot; on Twitter identified images , telling the disp@@ utes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves beat the news about pol@@ ishing repression in the centrally located north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves from the government and armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including those woman in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear a tube , because you could see anything else , which many national animals do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Inf@@ ographic creates the round that forms the extent of repression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the requirement for a term procedure - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many , by the presence of countless people on the street . &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your counterpart !

they took us so much - but also the fear !
the markets always take more of frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Vene@@ tians reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ ted version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was released on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentin@@ ean news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret imprisonment in the Argentine city of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now began his father in the framework of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father can carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , who observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation , I thought that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , you don &apos;t know that it is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I was not able to realize that my father was a thief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os son , a man who had experienced during the years the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he had said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows that great power is a parent about his child , and as this child chose a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to join me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had a boy with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
you are an ass@@ hole you have got yourself with one of the ERP .
&quot; just do that , that they will not lead you one day and I have to save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation of ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
&quot; therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go into the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be obe@@ yed . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father loved me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da to practice the prisoners are tortured
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he told me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bell wrapped in a blanket , and ordered me to wear it . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were completed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
&quot; suddenly he pointed out to an open space , and said : &quot;
these prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I saw in , and saw a song , tortured on men . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; they gro@@ unded a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ thrown him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the shooting there was horri@@ ble ... just like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible to do a person to another so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and bore eyes . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was accused in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which bare people with the face down , all were folded in hands and feet . &quot;
near the entrance k@@ ett@@ led people still stands on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; What do you look like , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and was killed by soldiers and was buried .
I know this because my father told us at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero sm@@ ashed a man there and killed a man .
&quot; according to the survivors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was also indicted by students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the road that you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; looking at the map , see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed , and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of de@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement came from above that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was by the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I was sure that war yield was a b@@ aj@@ on@@ ett or maybe military signs , which one has fought for an enemy who has fought . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I am always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never liked to penet@@ rate into a house and ste@@ aling everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crimin@@ als and I answered : and you who asc@@ ended up cars on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against rage , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and bring you strange . &quot;
we don &apos;t need any other !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have any good memory to him .
&quot; as I said in the trial , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a rolling pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father out of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I accused me of defence , a fellow fellow in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay mine for the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to pro@@ hibit . &quot;
&quot; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ous act , &apos; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel sick . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you know the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; one develops , and recognizes that it is false to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ ek@@ ed people during the dictatorship . but what remains the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why do children lead ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
I always asked the question : they were tortured but why were they killed ?
they would have been to be put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why does the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families to be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
&quot; the dis@@ appearances of suffering is the last ab@@ hor@@ red act , which one can do with man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re @-@ established , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of cap@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , signi@@ fying my father , was created during a talk , as he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities which I had to do with him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I never killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , what the whole over@@ power@@ ing patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually were good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you committed horri@@ ble crime , and you comp@@ elled me to participate in a child . &quot;
&quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; Well , I forgive . &quot;
that was exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I re@@ signed the first display . &quot;
&quot; finally , I had known that he was a criminal . &quot;
no one can tell me that I am pre@@ set . I finally said against my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , standing before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was charged with 416 criminal charges : among them heavier , un@@ justi@@ fiable freedom of freedom in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the order of the sentence .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 supp@@ resses were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and the court found life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases of detention between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ a judgement : murder ; torture and rape by officers . # Es@@ war@@ heads terrorism
&quot; all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; the Court of Justice is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations , who for years worked for righteousness for years . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , founded in 1995 by the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of men who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government transferred the country to La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial to be established there by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Kyoto city of Kyoto , customers of the newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very special failed translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign was the Japanese word of the kill@@ ings ( co@@ aches below sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , but perhaps also with ar@@ ches back@@ ge@@ ance &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1 to 20 September , the false translation was broadcast on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , which was also attentive to the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto &apos;s daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the correct English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto police pre@@ judi@@ ces for the translation mistake . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been verified by trans@@ lators and that the translation was not tested for their correc@@ t@@ ness before they had been published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of elderly drivers . according to the police , the share of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by seniors in 2005 , representing a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the Seniors issued 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has dropped in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ named reporter brought in the article published in the article published in Yahoo , published in Yahoo , published some Japanese accus@@ ations against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation error has been given the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) about reality ?
&quot; - &quot; &quot; If the translation is wrong , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation mistake .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in all Asia is so common
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true foundation of this bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the vast prolifer@@ ation of trans@@ lators are varied .
&quot; for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and transmit the language skills to put it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active correction of the target language - something that is in case of native language . in general , the belief that trans@@ lators should be in the finish language - not in the initial language - native language . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speakers should be translated into French by English - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese company does not employ any employee with English as native language that could make translations into English . this may be a lack of understanding for the transition , quot@@ as , or the relatively small number of English speakers who are jap@@ an@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have not have any foreign employees , let translations be un@@ qualified . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
mach@@ ined translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that are created by machine translation into which this technique can not be replaced as long as a human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic attachment , are used often with T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only from st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not to be understood or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but by large enterprises or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto uses hopefully a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protest and C@@ ens@@ orship on the Internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y S@@ oc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an internet user that they have no access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet access of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV did not be accessible anymore . &quot;
other online channels carried out recordings of protests in Caracas that were organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that oppos@@ e Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was stuck , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ean provider are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission approved telec@@ oms with fin@@ es and fin@@ ances when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission said this as &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable and informative national TV channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a lock of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two additional online channels . this also concerns the website dedicated to the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; earlier after@@ math of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet providers can sometimes use DNA . this is a technique that in@@ correct the DNS servers of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers correctly or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ Angel@@ we@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ blocked channel , was set up on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera was Elvis Flo@@ res , who was broadcast live in Caracas . &quot;
Flo@@ res was struck while he was placed in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
&quot; even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government was also regulated that the government is regulated by Internet connections . thus , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ers will still keep access to multimedia coverage about the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will become a slave to get an apprenticeship &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina fights for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of cour@@ tur@@ ally .
&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ tur@@ f , which was published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind approval of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ed cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they did not live together with the family , who lived there . &quot;
&quot; just before her studies at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house filled with pride upon them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , they den@@ otes the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money over@@ gives their regular child or her min@@ ig@@ old daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what does not mean , however , that the children may have to pay for a countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a treaty you can &apos;t raise . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimonies and den@@ ounced .
&quot; she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated with the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the family , on the one hand , is the family that they conclude their daughter in the faith that they will improve their training in society , and can make something from itself , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that the girl takes up with ones@@ elf and its exploitation is justi@@ fiable with faith that she would have no chance , who would otherwise have been an hung@@ red , and perhaps even hunger . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , this has been a relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent ra@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military house Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official citizen .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira gave birth to Mar@@ ín as long as they suffered a fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made a deeply ro@@ oted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there will be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay up more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations called a breeding investigation of the case .
&quot; they want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison by Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be a landmark case - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for workers , they live also isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to go all work , started to sell on the road or on the market of sweets to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to As@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of their employers between four and six hours each day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still remained time for learning . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was come to an end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they get ready with learning , the more leisure it had . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to hunger , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the master &apos;s library as a meal out of the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but didn &apos;t stand with her . &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had someone found someone who was talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they had the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habits &quot; . &quot; that said Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , to speak at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; her Lord feared the education that they had enabled , would lose it again . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she had paid of them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated in school . &quot; a thing that is never talked about almost never , are m@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are Cri@@ ad@@ itas if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I could not invite anyone home to me . I had no friends in school or the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friends arise , I felt particularly obvious that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share opportunities for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in As@@ unci@@ on , As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;

Bill writes about Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; sixty Egyptian members recently voted to vote on &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users and users have to register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; based on the law , a job would then be set up to share social media by citizens , citizens and citizens . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users and users have to register their right name and number sign numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it fail to do this , so it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fin@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is run on the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video files and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is thought when it is accepted , as the draft may not be imposed on how Egyptian authorities should not plan the user to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure government regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and promot@@ er of the law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password &quot; to come across the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks away . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to create a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts in the place are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they are non@@ violent physical and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they will apply a strong monitoring system to monitor citizens to monitor a approval or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also contribute to a judicial process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Chamber of Parliament and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees , before going to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; if his acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , whose senses is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating Nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those planned to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; and &quot; to protest the &quot; public order . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards , who runs through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to the Wil@@ der , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less lo@@ ot . &quot;
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows up in the video , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem , also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video reveals that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , documented in the nor@@ theastern Japan &apos;s daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , progress made during the last six years , triggered by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake that triggered a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukushima . &quot;
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i which is located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture were to see both the earthquake and the tsun@@ ami in the tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring regions of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ish all coastal towns of the map .
&quot; yet , the Fukushima Pre@@ fecture witnessed a nuclear accident in Fukushima alone , just about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the Special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o clearly shows the progress of six years after the adv@@ ent of the local government .
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ constru@@ cting authorities as well as pol@@ l results of the affected themselves .
&quot; residential property in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o paper reports that in December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( s of the kill@@ ings of the kill@@ ings of the kill@@ ings of the members of the Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while the final has its final light against Fukushima with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ ong@@ u was still stri@@ cken in final spare houses , even six years after the disaster . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shelter . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate in such conditions . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of Fukushima still lived in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated by the disaster , were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the stand of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o paper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the mis@@ fortune , opened its doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries have recovered their operations in Fukushima . &quot;
tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident happened in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agriculture areas , where only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , since only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fukushima , are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , the tourism has continued to recover , but also Fukushima remains far away . &quot;
&quot; tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fukushima , however , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants , making it more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the indigenous population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys below the local population and under the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also , as you have changed emp@@ ties over the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung declares :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in disaster prevention has been done . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who have evacu@@ ated from the Fukushima Pre@@ fecture , &quot;
&quot; in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; Fukushima won &apos;t just had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture were also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic nuclear , atomic fact that Japan had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fukushima , almost 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fukushima , in long lasting replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 state of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants live in Fukushima outside of their home country pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hes , most of the evacu@@ ations are older than 50 years of age . you will be able to rec@@ la@@ ze the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people find people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the common@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one recognizes however often that a more than it seems to be at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our advantages , expand our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices po@@ d@@ cast , we look exactly this global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention when they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members that remember from a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to someone over Spanish and country borders .

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer had struck him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of protest@@ ers took part in protest against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ ität Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures . &quot;
doctors trained him this Saturday and have put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local educational journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread rapidly into Brazil within a few days .
&quot; on the pictures , the vision of the police officer is also recogni@@ zable with a striking result . the man was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the termination of the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia in his impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by demonstr@@ ators and in the intensive care station , his face would be seen six months in television and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z recorded video on the net in which you see how Mat@@ eus was attacked by the police officers and several sanitary shortly after him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the below shown clip , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated $ 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to stay part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here the activist from his father was assassin@@ ated because he was sabot@@ aged by the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary School . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who has attacked him with a striking stock .
police transfers
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to a brutal police raid against demonstr@@ ators in the last Friday .
&quot; polic@@ emen continued in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber , rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Prime Minister Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media group has mo@@ cked the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass windows to illustr@@ ate their cover page with a photo .
&quot; by contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title @-@ story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also recognize if one is strict against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , un@@ equal importance , and the typical violence of the military police are carried out by headlines with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on the con@@ front@@ ational course of the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the villages of forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills included the doors in Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the Pop@@ ular congregation of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as an el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , un@@ aware that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were im@@ planted in the sugar cane mill .
&quot; after the awakening , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the job .
&quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes a day to factories , which still grin@@ d . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a solo@@ ist veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , does not smoke its sleep in the sugar tube industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which are still in operation after a long time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembers exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar coal industry resist@@ or the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ suffici@@ ency , the poor administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount . &quot;
&quot; some decades ago , the message would have been a motive for the country for some decades , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a revival . &quot;
why was the Cuban Su@@ gar@@ bage industry switched off ?
the old platform of the village saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the su@@ cking of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus on the production of the most efficient factories which amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ en@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ ves , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the ascent rise in the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased from approximately one decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the OECD and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today , the day &apos;s day will go down with safety in history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory for 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene is known as soldier , above the closure of the factory , the word he is repeated most , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respondents say that this is not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - Working Group . &quot;
&quot; before the first tender year , the first letters started to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially related to documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could make any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , responsibility and letters were always more common . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation of the sugar cane factories .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will at the de@@ commissioning of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part , which he removed , he demonstrated one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important job producers were wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ places and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw that he was not able to run for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years . &quot;
price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted high by M@@ EPs . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the Volks@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory decided , or better , when they began to cancel them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they have been to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty of the old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; O Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no subsequent person , but there he told the lies that told him not . &quot;
they have tor@@ ment it for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene runs at 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in force , but because it is sp@@ elled . &quot;

first Nations you@@ ths use Hip @-@ Hop to express itself and maintain their own culture

youth of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do not deal with hip hop thanks to a series of mig@@ rant workshops .
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour has been able to teach mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres , to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live production . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and living in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will thus rise to that the young participants in talks about how &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever you may inv@@ ent in the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the field of the family of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ e Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , how important to the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always rule the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation have taken , the chor@@ us will be sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the students involved a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in converting , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German : &quot;
&quot; sometimes I feel , no one would ever be interested in me &quot;
&quot; but I try to go on earth on earth , &quot;
&quot; that is the day , at which you will take our cry &quot;
&quot; because we have lost our way to life , &quot;
&quot; but I believe that we will rise one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so , they can grow and also forward to our youth . &quot;
&quot; so , can they do that for what they appointed the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary volume , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ dium ( which is also published on his blog and will be re@@ issued here ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what &apos;s exactly on the menu , will be exhibited near the entrance sho@@ ck@@ hin : &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of every food that will be served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies which produce plastic dishes , which has documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they don &apos;t even change them anymore . however , a new trend is turned into show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ck@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sales : new with plastic scre@@ ed decorated mobile tapes as they are shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ ant collections , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ot fri@@ dges mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of eating habits is becoming increasingly complicated .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel dish with seafood ) turned into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also produced this part for the Tokyo Station .
&quot; and here is an apple , holding your mobile phone : &quot;
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight to coma .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or Lach@@ en@@ che@@ v is used , a popular T@@ opping which will be served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also receive a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ on ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further c@@ ile plastic dishes can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # ( s @-@ handed ) . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . as for example , the sho@@ ck@@ ball is rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against the organized crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the missing and dr@@ illed only occur in statistics . however , this mirror does not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that brings the struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , pressed the stories of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or on the municipalities that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds might never be healing . &quot;
this is why the Mexican News Portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade live &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organis@@ ational crimes lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to drive many municipalities so many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
&quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; the fear of fear &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is looking for secret graves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ phe@@ ws only a single day . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have asked to go and go to the graves , according to the people whom we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; my mother , too , is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but that doesn &apos;t pay it out because they require a mortality rate . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; editors are explained : why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only need to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community for conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
&quot; since some years , illness and Sens@@ ations journ@@ alism I have already known for some years . &quot;
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures which are actually only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from acquis@@ itions of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that something happened to them too . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories will be naked numbers in a statistic . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ justice of man is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighbour that they were . &quot;
&quot; I think they try to talk about that they will not spare the trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of ext@@ ortion in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats of their business until they were not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up , when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed your phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to de@@ duce you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these fear@@ ful days , if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ root feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence .
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions about how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and one man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
what is it like to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make an egg co@@ oks , potatoes , tortillas makes warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that makes with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all life from violence , and learning to live thereby . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody suffering of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , as violence through the organized crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of citizenship for government security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosecutor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 murders . this corresponds to the average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few of thousands of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul . &quot;
&quot; just a few stories live in view of the new headlines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; the data journ@@ alism project is called Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to study the complex information behind the failed fight against drugs that has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand words , &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he link , contain images , on which violence is depicted . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment , in which it &apos;s about to raise a rum@@ or or a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after being immer@@ sed the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tend to pass on . &quot;
we take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo for seven years ago .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been used to illustr@@ ate trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false Cou@@ pling of Image and Event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - do not deny the fact that there are plentiful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it raises questions concerning our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa had been negle@@ cted for years and caused by devast@@ ation . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of impact holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically the tan@@ ker fell victim to the victims .
&quot; a deputy , a fire@@ ball , was described as a fire@@ ball , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championship . &quot;
&quot; houses brutal and knot@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses , scattered in the streets . &quot;
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; Das ist Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5. multiple photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day . &quot;
&quot; up , is an example for this . &quot;
&quot; it shows rows of knot@@ ted body , which are rounded up on the ground during persons . &quot;
but here the story does not find her end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been qu@@ en@@ ched several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but in fact it is not to be attributed to the related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the outskirts of the towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
eyes were dra@@ stically reported by atro@@ cities before they flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bones .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people have been massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; said a population on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burnt . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again when it was due to proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ appropri@@ ations ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was taken as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; another step further bring personal comments , such as this example fal@@ sely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 did not claim that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an said , monks and politicians had been involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to picture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , which called AFP as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but had not thus brought the picture from the DR Congo in connection . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the global reach of false information &quot;
&quot; traces of these false de@@ coupling dates back to the year 2011 and 2012 , and actually came from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; using a &quot; reverse picture , &quot; you can see how far information borders can be exceeded . &quot;
the search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found more than 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , agreed upon , others have attempted to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s . &quot;
&quot; we have obtained examples of mis@@ use in use and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they had been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language only . &quot;
several examples of all listed countries ( which were also connected together in some cases ) can be used several examples of mis@@ use .
&quot; here are some cases , which can now be applied completely ( on the map in orange ) : &quot;
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ related countries show pages or server , are still available on the examples of counterfeit detection or false reports . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery @-@ examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only use the mis@@ use of the picture , but also the mis@@ use of the picture from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions according to the Int@@ enti@@ ons of Persons and the related trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria &apos;s qu@@ em@@ ando a los cri@@ sti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) . &quot;

&quot; La Rep@@ ublic@@ a lica is cited as his source , the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known whether the original report has the picture ) . &quot;
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster to do this . &quot;

a association of the students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the news agency Nas@@ im and used to illustr@@ ate the picture of the DR Congo .

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ used use of the picture from the DR Congo , with a Twe@@ et , the sympath@@ y versus the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya become persecuted , because the photos were used badly . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a judge for what they described as &quot; intenti@@ onally emp@@ tied news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judge , which is only published in English only , includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that are used by the Spe@@ ech Spe@@ ech and widespread in extrem@@ ist groups , that Muslims are used to kill the Budd@@ hi@@ sts and the other side ( which is often widespread by bur@@ ial nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post which was addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this news site claims that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an have been involved in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge . &quot;
the article has been updated 2014 and at the time of this release the image is still included .
Spain 2015 / 2016 .
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who were murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ leen near the An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture is not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ art@@ isan attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in circulation in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te its connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were suspected in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with no religious context were taken . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to direct attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( English ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that supposedly had been written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacres , in circulation , discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; from the Embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further examples of a faulty usage of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( one frame ) that passes these posts . the first frame focuses on Religion .
&quot; the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in the context of Christians through Muslims , or - for the defense of Muslims - the murdered victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as . &quot;
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can &apos;t give these images longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are endless people who have an un@@ intenti@@ onal share of practicing water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ars this mood of the failure and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
&quot; the spread of for@@ cible images have already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example , here ) . &quot;
&quot; an argument is that this will return from images of an ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concerns that non@@ violent pictures and spectators des@@ en@@ si@@ bil@@ ize and receive the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who sought to work as non@@ violent media on them to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot regarding violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists have experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will thoroughly clari@@ fy about situation in which a picture can differ slightly from the context or on completely mis@@ used species . &quot;
&quot; each investigation is false , but should also take into consideration as internationally as they can . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . un@@ translated ) is trying to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated .
&quot; such words are available in any language : you express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ mistak@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others who were ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example Spanish so@@ cks ) .
but all resist hard to any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression does not satisfy why a full explanation , and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese and Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s own language as :
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Do you feel about your parents in recognition of how to stri@@ ve for yourself in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik Language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun .
&quot; in Bir@@ ds , words from his blog about : &quot;
&quot; they s@@ anders other cultures , reveal other ideas and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words , and demonstrate how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

&quot; like Sri Lanka , the worst flood catastrophe of the decade &quot;
&quot; at the island of Sri Lanka , the worst floo@@ ding and the cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster in this decade are over . &quot;
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally set at the end of May , are caused by strong rain@@ falls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster area of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of men are missing because of the floods and slaughter . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected by Friday ( 26th May ) and approximately 100 000 people were handed over to 304 safe locations .
&quot; the rainfall took place on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the waters in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able areas .
the following pictures and videos create an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water distances of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to high water situation .
many use h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods have lost the crisis of the den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children , after further rain@@ falls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle flooded with G@@ alle flooded during the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a yesterday . &quot;
the Air Force has made five air@@ crafts for rescue actions and five are made available for transportation of emergency deliveries to the residents in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims - &quot;
we are today in the region around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if you need help in this area . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year , after the cat@@ astrop@@ hy of the Trophy Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; high water aid &quot; button , which allowed users to collect a vehicle for collection of aid services and donations . these were then re@@ directed to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ic Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; similarly , they led a &quot; SOS button &quot; which had more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat operation for floods through floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , with which several social media platforms are fully exhausted , they bring inhabitants in need of security and afford help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;

&quot; when used to be approved , I took part in San Francisco on the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I confi@@ de in her four years old daughter , they trusted in me their children : she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in which one minute we call for the rights of women . &quot;
in the next step we add rights to trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other channels against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I have already managed this entertainment .
&quot; people , with whom I work or people who have known me for years , split me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their conception . &quot;
they mus@@ cled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look like .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims I do not wear there , can be mus@@ cled . &quot;
to be kidn@@ apped
I do not stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet that poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are in mind if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as the Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion has been extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a big part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another consists in the reduced images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man who should fear , and the exotic woman that one should save . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said , the story behind these pictures . &quot;
but these pictures also stand out today .
&quot; furthermore , our politicians , the news industry , and Hollywood . &quot;
I &apos;ve been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful and in@@ correct fol@@ ks domin@@ ate our news feeds .
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ fication fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women will carry on it , their head towel in public buildings are forced to cover and aci@@ dic women through their government , to cover their entire body , which both sides are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group practic@@ ed his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ fication weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movements for change .
it considers that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken to American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought together with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely sum@@ med up our collective strength of such a deep and in@@ correct , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children are becoming an an@@ tim@@ ed ass@@ ort@@ able attacks and attacks . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; we also create nar@@ r@@ ative , helping us to understand the world . &quot;
&quot; and my industry has failed to tell us , the nar@@ rati@@ fication of 1.7 billion dollars . &quot;
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim populations are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my parents immig@@ rated to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother made her first jewellery design at 5th Avenue in front of 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ married Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ um@@ bled Muslim and American now ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ some pocket , whom all Muslims contribute to themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ p@@ W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m sorry we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ tray with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological expert to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen for extra security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced in the ongoing volume of a well @-@ decorated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with money la@@ vers , think @-@ tanks and experts for fal@@ se@@ atic information which is a Muslim , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories we tell and due to the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a fore@@ igner who breaks the head towel . &quot;

I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born until I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my friend , my neighbor , my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when they could see through the 15 metres of concrete and air that could separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms , and you are called the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ uls . &quot;
every of them I repeat three times .
&quot; therefore , I ask that they are protected from evil , evil which you may see , and evil which you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging to my grandmother is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s maternal part with their sisters ; how they win a competition of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi before decades .
&quot; it is the picture of you that I close my eyes in this moment when I finished my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings at Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and one basket with many book@@ marks , a book with one hund@@ red@@ ths of fourteen chapters that it can be almost sufficient . &quot;
&quot; for him , the Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim , in it , as she has taught me to refer to God : Allah is what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who became colonial - over centuries - through a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name honour@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to call God my sole Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time my dar@@ ed grandfather w@@ cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the middle , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ y , N@@ ana J@@ aan pleaded not guilty to his family in India , he was unable to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , like in my grandfather , were torn apart from colon@@ ists who shared the Muslim world as in the game risk . &quot;
&quot; for example , Muslim means to know that in the past two centuries Europeans have been colonial all over the four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the history was kicked off in a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , a Indian , flu@@ ent subject of the British Empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; , since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people , it goes deep to our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plug@@ ged story . &quot;
&quot; it means of remin@@ ding that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , to pursue mass destruction of weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
&quot; for example , an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate under veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy takes home the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a history with a white attacks . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four @-@ hundred years ago , the first prayer call , Az@@ aan , of a liberated black slaves , called Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed , and brought into this country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black life .
&quot; an American woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ se@@ ct@@ ality of our with multiple bin@@ ders to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the nar@@ rati@@ fication of the 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities than a magic cube , but will be represented in reducing branches &quot; &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are er@@ ect on this branch &apos;s structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is set up in the Muslim tab that began with President Bush and applied under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immig@@ rant , who takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just over the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; which takes part in the Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we dis@@ card on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to those who we don &apos;t tell us , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientific image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning the evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we must lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to reveal the Muslim , or the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades to detect the roots of our fears , and the in@@ correct and dangerous impression that we present in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our multiple @-@ winning ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the po@@ d@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ ling ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Square ; the Vir@@ al Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of the ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sho@@ ot Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increased Muslim authors - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned with this difficult global tim@@ eline in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason that con@@ spir@@ ators theore@@ ti@@ cian , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
another group has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally and has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by making the &quot; others &quot; created .
&quot; a few years before , it had not been given them ; now they prevail great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story that I was not aware of myself when I was so old , as it is my daughter now , but I have made me today to an un@@ um@@ found Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a breaking of bread in my speech .
&quot; things , perhaps memories are aw@@ aken , because in all the inter@@ section that makes our human@@ kind , a story is l@@ ur@@ king , where someone is made to another &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley conversation is held as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we are usually cast in our schools or we read in our newspapers . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I t@@ ame this at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us , such as wars are led and people through the work of the &quot; others &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago even science of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to imagine un@@ comfortable questions after the role of its , conscious and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; others &quot; in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation we have no pre@@ sidents , while already capit@@ ated countries and &quot; to others , &quot; humans have been bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts with all of us here .
initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to preserve urban lingu@@ istic diversity
tell your story about Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
&quot; can there be a possibility , here and now , in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ? &quot;
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer to this . &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices , recently informed about another initiative by Steven Bird , the im@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the subject , but on the spoken word . it deals with an attempt to preserve the language diversity of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be given to the born children . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project are :
&quot; mass mortality of the languages of the world may be avoided , when we do cities , accept diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to be . &quot;
&quot; during &quot; I often listen to it , &quot; to understand , &quot; these events instead &quot; to listen , &quot; to appreciate , to make . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller initially set her story in their own language , and then declare them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their de@@ vot@@ ion and its representation do not lead to the audiences . &quot;
they call laugh@@ ed and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the subsequent video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this lap , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cons@@ ates also the opportunity to explain the story of the nar@@ r@@ ative customs of stories . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the H@@ oses and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; asked John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to talk to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ sen , he shares his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity : &quot;
they have heard too !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; to date , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . everyone who inspired by the project can be able to contact T@@ LS in touch with their own stor@@ yt@@ elling . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for new stat@@ ute of state debt
&quot; the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars on April 3 , 2017 , participated in a mass demonstration in the capital city of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group of &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ onal approval of the debts ) and the Ec@@ ological Assembly of Puerto Rico .
&quot; the advoc@@ ate of the new debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico requires that the politicians , B@@ än@@ kers and government agencies , who are responsible for the debts to be taken into responsibility for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial test and an management committee without personal interests to public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions , corresponding to the economy . &quot;
we are re@@ pressed and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not de@@ vote themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian website Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been lost since over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remin@@ ding the contributions that he did for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is organized in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ side ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is licensed here in the last year , contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it means : &quot;
&quot; this book aims to establish how mot@@ ions for freedom of knowledge are structured , and what is the true cost , with whom it is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of Fre@@ es Knowledge , have worked on site to watch over the fog that gives our news feeds to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteer who has been detained since 15 March 2012 in Syria . &quot;
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information regarding its current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that p@@ ushing to his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for its participation in free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of some extreme belie@@ fs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer of open source and digital activist has been in the Syrian government authorities in March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they were contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der Assad government and having taken care of a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his residence and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in providing access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently super@@ vis@@ ing the leaders of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe there was none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes stri@@ pping than the work , which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the country of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ian traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel wasn &apos;t able to know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS would put everything that architecture , not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world . &quot;
&quot; this mature train to the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a time cap@@ sul@@ ated , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English to me when he was already in custody .
&quot; I learned to read English well , to write and speak . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone , who asked . he taught others to read and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought the internet to me .
&quot; he also taught others , as they use computer , at least in theory , without knowing that they actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
they sailed the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them from the Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .
book cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an extract from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens :
&quot; it happens in every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sing in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment , in which we embrace us , &quot;
&quot; whatever the dangers , it doesn &apos;t matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , bonds and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ms of prison
and I &apos;m in every detail of your voice and words .
&quot; I bear with passion , my passion , &quot;
&quot; when your eyes say , &quot;
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to get all the moments , &quot;
and to weep and smile about your absence .
I bear witness myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
while doing so during
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of Monster
Bass@@ el &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) since the beginning of protests in 2011 , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or arrested by the regime , tortured or even executed under the regime . &quot;
&quot; by 2016 , according to international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International have died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community urges the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : convicted of corruption condemned by corruption to fore@@ ground post
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , their advice Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good guide , and immediately called his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ment of the Republic , which was granted to the application , there would be no obst@@ acle reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , since the company was no disciplinary trial after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants does not have the action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re@@ sign the Director : &quot;
&quot; re@@ pose a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
&quot; as we know , the company should also be conducting a discipl@@ in@@ arian proceedings against the previous occupation . &quot;
&quot; the company was apparent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps for use of the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; contradi@@ cted &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant when he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had eaten . &quot;
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es he could advise and put his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has settled to re@@ integrate into the company that he helped harm harm . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
resi@@ sted !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political science in Brazil , says the director of no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone has been rewarded with such a way that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality to come back and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it was only served by the state instead . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ ful for an in@@ exhau@@ stible cash source and the state itself , this man became tired , that was pre @-@ loaded and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el Pr@@ ison is not only remembered as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , one @-@ reaching , and - to say - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous represent@@ ations was , when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of selling the fath@@ er@@ land for its amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know whether a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious man is a criminal time at the same time .
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also le@@ aning : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down for 10 years and came free .

Facebook is blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users wrong
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or sp@@ inning .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network hosts their posts from the net because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the source of the Word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ jec@@ tively &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; , &quot; as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely lax@@ ative con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has made a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself calls not automatically to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use , cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; beyond , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings , which have the same book names like &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese even &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ate My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in the rich way whether they were w@@ aking up , how he could so@@ wing his back pain in turning a word game . &quot;
&quot; the movement ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ ing word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that they must be radic@@ ally reducing and radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook should be analy@@ tic to spread over all posts that are suspected in sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automation does not understand what you write on Fac@@ tors .
&quot; what should make it instead , the post is carefully analysed and control it by checking the words of the words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) .
&quot; the good thing is that these three nation@@ alists , who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , received a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ eks have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship of drums often become a cross and mouse game , with the users social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative notation of cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his account when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was subject to the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of Po@@ sts from people who have no negative int@@ entions or are simply trying to show their opinions against the hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed but has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook is removed .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believed that Facebook should have to do more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a good int@@ ent int@@ ent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
&quot; for such words , only more hatred will take place within the various communities . &quot;
&quot; it seems , as if they have started this without local context or technical support , and such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have banned . &quot;
&quot; even as they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ sely dissolved Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has a lot of reproach among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now have fun funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no more hate language , but still removed : &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks will also heating violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was crit@@ ici@@ zed for his failure , the bal@@ ancing hate speech against his bur@@ ial sites , crit@@ ici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finally is with the child .
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanimously approved a law that aims to offer this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the sp@@ ouse , some members held du@@ alistic and Muslim communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state , as that , at age do not climb the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened , not@@ with@@ standing the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN Children Convention on Climate Protection , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every man under 18 years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal State Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were ende@@ av@@ ed to finish the laws for children before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced by great support . undoubtedly they helped bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du Guide , for example , had no concerns to say the criticism of the children of children , they should still take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition campa@@ igned for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime some doubts they would agree on whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was approved against the children of children - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country , on Facebook , gave a status update , which has again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the child &apos;s before was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
&quot; after being decided in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws have been finally changed for children before .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minister on the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary barley , used the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , I definitely had long enough to do the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who heard the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years old .
&quot; the draft for the amendment to the marriage was today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were opposed , voted for the law . &quot;
the child before is legally not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) #
many thanks to all activists who have cast him out .
congratulations . congratulations .
thanks to our members .
&quot; yet a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to do judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise now . &quot;
&quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General in Paris Al ra@@ wi , a dis@@ advoc@@ ate of the law , said that Mahar@@ aj was against the law , most social media users wanted to change the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; prefer Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so commonly , in a way that only contradi@@ ct panic and un@@ wor@@ m@@ wood , that , instead of the problem , we may assume that they may be mis@@ used by major , persistent men who may be ab@@ used against them , would you be willing to carry out the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
&quot; but if it comes to a court appearance against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children may be legal or still the norm , even though there is laws which they say . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers controlled the office of the State of State before national protests in front of the Russian National Day
screen print of the message that was posted on Sunday early on the website of the State of Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l &apos;s website .
&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with the day of Russia - the Russian national holiday , the website of the State of the District of Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l . h@@ ack@@ ers have left a funny message . &quot;
&quot; or we &apos;ll get you in the Kn@@ ast instead of Dim@@ on , instead of Dim@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the website of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office : &quot; the office of the State of State invites citizens to follow pro@@ vocation , and keep away from all non @-@ san@@ ction events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the site - in the cache it still remained . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the office of the State Court awarded the local news service Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by sk@@ e@@ wers of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was shown on January 18 , 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright in the United States . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since over a month , Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day is clear@@ er , how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and fans and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock .
&quot; although many techniques , Internet users are used to use block tools for block websites ( an current article by the New York Times reports that Turkey does not have the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been closed by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform is still locked , several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages , which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform is based on all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names , making it a complete c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able despite legal prohibition . &quot;
in a Blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the lock of Wikipedia ) , we set everything concerning snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents to de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed . &quot;
this can help the users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ .org website .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to focus on the need for nature conservation
&quot; an impressive rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around and never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad and washed colors .
&quot; this motivated him to wear a camera , and try to gra@@ ze the situation . &quot;
then he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ al@@ as animal world meets the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home town directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Nepal as animal world . &quot;
&quot; he described Facebook , as he helps him this first @-@ class situation at his work : &quot;
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park in a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
&quot; I rested from home when suddenly in Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) had called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the sho@@ res of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam is only a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was on and I immediately began to gn@@ ash pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar scattered cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese Nature and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so terrible as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , for he has already turned face to face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be distur@@ bed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was too bad because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ chan@@ ks appeared . he sits down immediately , and let &apos;s start with the S@@ al Tre@@ es ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to photograph in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist information . &quot;
see some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women for the first time to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands &quot;
&quot; women in the small Indian village , Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand . &quot;

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video volumes , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ released here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands or even from older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure of the husband and fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm in the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a spot@@ light and viol@@ ated her family and the village community after having responded to a married relatives . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives is also not common in their name , is also common in men . however , they have far less access to worry if whatsoever , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in Pun@@ e , Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , and house@@ wives , a unique club , and so quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone to discuss the enemy of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is run by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and set up for the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ s . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the end of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS Indians , and direc@@ ts these clubs . &quot;
it reports that these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously to ambassador &apos;s ambassador .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , was of women who did not call her husbands at name . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this topic , because she wanted to open the conversation about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves . &quot;
&quot; to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands , a spectac@@ le is not guilty to keep them guilty and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
&quot; this tradition testified that a woman respects her husband , and wishes for a long life . &quot;
&quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t stand this will be regarded as post@@ ure , as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning of the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never been named after her husband to try at home with her husband , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini is telling :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned over to me and said I should call him now at his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started its first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked for all participants to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women are never allowed to speak to their husbands &apos;s name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini is telling :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole practice it was pl@@ eted , and another decided to release all the fru@@ stration against him and his family to curse him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ exchange rate , with an ancient bre@@ wing , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call her husbands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , asking what ideas they sat in the head : his wife could not stop to say his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; she was afraid as her mother @-@ in @-@ law , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it .
&quot; a husband of a participant , was less understand@@ able , and the situation in force was in force . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports , such as women have tried to stop other practices , such as the tra@@ ps of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the marriage status : &quot;
why just have women to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he would like it . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard him to bear him . &quot;
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but I mean they are now in a better position to choose it , not to carry it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion w@@ ak@@ y is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re doing an excursion on any case of discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure the women will make , who could hear what you hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes , they sang and sang and spoke about things that they never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; for so many years I have been working on these problems , but I have also worked on some things , for example , like our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never talked to be honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great , some things seem to say loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we have talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only borne Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast inhibit@@ or over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe , mor@@ ality linked to Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ y Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a at which they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion had already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly into rolling : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but stopped doing so on to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead now .
the women in discussion w@@ b know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like F@@ eil@@ ing around more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something .
&quot; and I know it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman is talking about home and other people talk about what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs were taken .
&quot; two men were arrested , and in the succession they stood , that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;

it is the first time that successive attacks have been registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of murdered for ob@@ sc@@ ure uses , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country led a mission to investigate the practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ce . &quot;

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia who was probably made recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of arrested Chinese dis@@ sidents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has taken attention in the international community attention , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June , that he was delivered to the hospital for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state partner ) after having responded to the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which has demanded the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , to release and allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely pronounced . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations - United Nations
&quot; poin@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should practice pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway got into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2010 , although the Norwegian government had failed to do nothing with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were resumed only in December of the last year . in June Norway was signed an agreement to re@@ take the salmon vessel to China since the exports has been blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the message has been spreading that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to a unconditional release and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was not able to oppos@@ e his prize . &quot;
Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leading position of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she said in a statement on June 30 , 2011 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all visits and receive , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would wish him , that he had the opportunity for treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar as it is to help him in his gen@@ ius . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy was to release the Chinese authorities , not only Liu X@@ ia , but also to release his wife Liu X@@ ia of their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious answer from China after , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to have an un@@ reasonable and un@@ respon@@ sive comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple &apos;s couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel strikes and access to the medical care of its choice , which they have claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a resolution in the Congress to push the Chinese government on it , Liu and his wife unconditional free . &quot;

&quot; Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Liu explains all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , on the G20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns , whether the Wir@@ bel could overs@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um ordered China to provide appropriate medical care and provide him the opportunity to provide themselves from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AFP earlier that Li@@ us Mrs. , Liu X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital , and that Liu was not allowed to contact with someone outside , including his lawyers and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada urges China to preserve its international human rights issues , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old the rights of the rights of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s foreign minister urged China to release Liu &apos;s humanitarian reasons on 29 June 2015 :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can contact him . &quot;
&quot; even though the news channel France has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Foreign Ministry announced that there will be no further information if France will eventually receive him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of permanent affairs in Taiwan required China on June 27 , to show Liu &apos;s and a greater tolerance towards those that demand peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic evolution . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , also called for the ruling party of China to allow sick of intellectual Liu , to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried about Liu &apos;s declaration on 28th June , and gave him to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been strictly punished , to a harmon@@ ious , stable and wealthy China , which again contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the State of New York , the ministers noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
nobody has asked whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; it is , with most people commit an error . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Justice Minister to forgive logic in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable country , you can say that we should not be any country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had an attempt to escape from the responsibilities , a compulsory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of what he seemed ir@@ ref@@ utable . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns , which become permanent by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the river , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian mach@@ in@@ ers appear again , leaving the democr@@ ats , leaving logic , because they are better to power their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , answers to his American guests have been given answers to our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
appropriate questions he clo@@ ak with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our value K Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam should take the effort to clari@@ fy this point if he was highly paid , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; on the blog posted his comment on the blog , he shows that it should be able to read the entire address of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and no country . &quot;
read the inscription .
&quot; as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; he declared why elections in Singapore are so un@@ important , even if we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot;
he promised Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ tic@@ gam who is a leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev and the members of the old Guard , which I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ em@@ gam , member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leader , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he is def@@ ending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review de@@ fies the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Lord Sh@@ an@@ immune gam has committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ der editor ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique and it is equally rural and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the Government of government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam are serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people work their military service , they only defend their city but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ mation , Singapore is and always a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have a lot of people to be off@@ ended ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most griev@@ ous aspect at your residence or home country ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is set to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his conversation partners by making personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication is usually followed by default : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly before anger , when they are held for Americans , but do not distur@@ bed me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us from Americans by Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack , when they are travelling . &quot;
all Love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always borne little map@@ le blades to their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay people have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as well as the toler@@ ant country on ethnic groups .
we are not as such types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red very much .
&quot; it would make me nothing , if you would like to switch to Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is basically to be mir@@ ro@@ red - as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders aus &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really were a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that can be picked . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , it is in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to earn any attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; as far as I would go , I would even say that the desire to be free and alone , a main character of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; design@@ ating external as &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just cool polit@@ eness . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not talking about the fence around the fence .
&quot; we l@@ acks warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au , then entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada just sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video publishes a music video in Thailand , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took power in 2014 , and despite her promises to restore the civilian government , continues the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his instructions about his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video also refers to the persist@@ ently military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage , to describe the country &apos;s situation . &quot;
the video for song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video was shared on Facebook video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to view this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , in@@ particular , as it is the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; once again , check out these videos of the videos which relate to some of the political topics that have been pursuing in Thailand in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional Constitution which resulted in the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision concerning major national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; integration of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons appearing from the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to rever@@ t activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , supervised by the online content and persons accused of having assassin@@ ated the monarchy and prosec@@ uted the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is set up a strict dispos@@ ition against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ en@@ vy ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy , even though security experts warned they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax ev@@ asion . &quot;
&quot; video will even be shown in the video , such as persons will be thrown into a black v@@ oul@@ ders before adding them to an intern@@ ment camp . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison because they allegedly causes &quot; confusion &quot; in society and use Internet us@@ eless , they should ins@@ ulting the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the band members showed that the Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; the Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , has already been used during protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on to the ruins of the ghost town in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ ia

&quot; the following article written by Dmit@@ ri stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war has been officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ chlor@@ ic basin . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , mining , Geor@@ gy and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today &apos;s biggest part Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost @-@ cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there still lived more than 10,000 people , today there are just a few hundred people in this ghost town . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district had 16,000 people after it had barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey detached residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , known to K@@ u@@ sch@@ ak@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and seldom they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
&quot; he starts a conversation , and it is hard to finish this . &quot;
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I speak to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable glory buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and have their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha living about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ow@@ kas that can accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our Mother is forbidden to let us take photos , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her girlfriend something too and suddenly they leave the devast@@ ated building and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence sector ( cultivation of agricultural products for the self @-@ demand ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to come over the laps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies for free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen , but we will add zu@@ cchini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t moved from Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart is still going to remain in Fig@@ ur@@ ies , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to receive no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that they are supported their young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to come together regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha &quot; calls her to her . &quot; they said that we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .
I already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen , but we will add zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything , &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation partners Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five shared children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day she reminds of the village in front of war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ s@@ asia was simply gone ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) , recently . &quot;
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take something else , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is awarded approximately $ 9 children each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as nursery once found , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ ens and h@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; she tells us that it was first a frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
&quot; but in the course of time , she lost their fears . &quot;

&quot; we don &apos;t have a fear of the dark street , or a few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it rather has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any job and everyone lived as it was right .
&quot; every day , I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
&quot; as our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy separates us . &quot;
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , then hin@@ der the hill . &quot;
one group children now pursu@@ it the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for non@@ sense in their life .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama is home to migrants on their long journey
&quot; Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez gli@@ des a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; crossing the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink blue frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a target for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage in the anter@@ oom .
there is no signs for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you from Africa ? &quot;
&quot; currently it is more quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she would like to refuse anyone .
&quot; she helps them also and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them drugs that they can not pay them , they are massive them with a bal@@ m that drew from long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived before a short time . &quot;
I asked him if mom Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ring ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
&quot; they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , normally to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other way@@ men from Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together , and that they speak to the Afri@@ cans already on the What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his position , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ stu@@ et after Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always remain in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her to send text messages when they went to gr@@ asp her or to report her about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only functional hope for migrants who are travelling by Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the town , a tor@@ ch will lead to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family moved to migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ stick@@ ers can be sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he started to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
&quot; Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains , that he knows what the guests are doing . &quot;
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border about the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after being lived for three years , he was referred to a raid on his working place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , come from Central America , other residents open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tell me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to have money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a general practition@@ er , offered it her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all back for guests .
&quot; in the courses consult the passengers calm their phones , too . &quot;
&quot; today a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grand@@ ma , she fl@@ ashes with numerous photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s who has made a Kund@@ in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old . &quot;
she laughs at her while she introduces me short .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have gone before . &quot;

&quot; in the message , it is said that the app is to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities used to use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had completed the app to be exchanged with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police that the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online , and to remote control its own home network . &quot;
these app with filters for min@@ ors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; an app with these functions can , of course , can be used in various ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers may be able to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , pressing ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme toes and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( s of the boats of the &quot; &quot; F@@ ender China &quot; &quot; ) , photos from a check@@ point where police officers were checked by a check@@ point where police officers were in@@ discri@@ min@@ ed by the polic@@ emen as they have installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you &apos;re discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they are forced to use men , equipment that are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the att@@ acking technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( s of the &quot; &quot; Cap &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are added to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office to operation their computer and communications equipment . &quot;
&quot; a recent report of Freedom House , an American Human Rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree with the instruction to all residents and business@@ men , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible publishers , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or Death : part 1 : everything cri@@ es after Death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you see yourself and make sure you &apos;re alone on a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gone after and dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly visible , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if you return the reality , and looking behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ose , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth are caught on the axis of the un@@ healing . you know that you are caught up between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times three times , but this was not enough to make &quot; my lesson &quot; as chief of security services - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he exhibited his power over us by giving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts , which we knew . &quot;
five young people were torn apart from a peaceful protests like we@@ eds in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands to a town , which is up to the arter@@ ies with state security and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
I crossed the silence by calling several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice contrary to silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to get together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we serve us a splendid picture , which filled my expectations full and fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you have delivered the spirit out of the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the s@@ lu@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; Make you ready , we meet at the military security office . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can you go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you gave you all the way to the office of the security services . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several his men ; my father was already there as I now also .
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; let me hear how you cry &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; or you &apos;re only brave enough to scre@@ am , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ hop@@ ed eyes drew on me .
&quot; and you mourn , what to look for me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , did nothing to do with courage . &quot;
I was 18 years old . I was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
&quot; maybe it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I replied : &quot; I would not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look to you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; he is in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father equally with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , equal to that . &quot;
the gest@@ ures of this curse is to me until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an Armen@@ ian torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I crossed the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I let everything back with me . &quot;
&quot; afterwards again by the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells . &quot;
I pre@@ ve all the details just before going to the room .
otherwise they have given me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may sit down immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I attacked a well @-@ established communication method : with the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell count was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , he ultimately answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in any of the surrounding cells there was a respected man middle aged , which is similar to me and &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no striking fac@@ tions can be seen , and doctors not exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to my voice ? &quot;
all answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would love him , if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the colour of the destro@@ yer , until I saw the yellow light , which told us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ unders &quot; , &quot; playing on 13th S@@ ure of Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to stop .
&quot; this was the mystery of the mystery to protect the State Security before us and to prevent the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - so they played their denomin@@ ational replacement of their global perspectives . &quot;
&quot; this is no house , this is not a country ; it is a curse to which they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cons@@ ented the hearing and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the visual expressions that appe@@ als to him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can close so much more important than you to protest this bapt@@ isms and protest in demonstrations , which will soon be found at an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer me .
I can really say no more precisely when ins@@ ults and sli@@ ps have become a friendly conversation for me to a normal communication tool .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to get punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
in all its diversity .
&quot; to me , it is to me as much flesh as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls the loving &quot; confession . &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak . &quot;
your Hen@@ ker finds himself at your scre@@ am .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot withdraw your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams was not enough for him yet , so that they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first capture , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage , or whether that was one of the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them rarely changed while I was still in the range . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , why I stopped to cry out . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down , and found no pleasure at all , making it the next to an electrically charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity through all my body , enough to supply my entire district . &quot;
&quot; my semi@@ naked body , which lay out onto the ground , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
that must probably have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , who came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens , and the morning light meets the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ sti@@ ve youth : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you are re@@ located . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b scre@@ wed a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b cap@@ tains the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he sn@@ aps at his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what you can rely on , there is a cig@@ ar between his fingers or nic@@ ot@@ ine lips to discover . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , who was transferred to the conservative majority and seek their alt@@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ es@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ ants , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these themes will not only be found in his home town of Amman , but also in cities that reach from Damascus within Yemen . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limitations in his mind , and he can participate according to their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he appe@@ als a special ab@@ duct against the US American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation &quot; - so , even if he was born in Palestine and never until now was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life &apos;s life , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into two cups , it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions , on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sel@@ ess hot jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the sli@@ pping is loud coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you take a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one avo@@ ids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled one of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila to the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary report that support the Islamic A@@ cting Front - argu@@ ed the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual fron@@ ts , Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , speaks to the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert tab@@ s . &quot;
the M@@ EPs and the former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous acti@@ vism , which poses the old proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to s@@ ligh@@ ten rhet@@ oric , but actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alline reality reflected in Jordan that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Plant . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b made traditional gender nor@@ ms to body by turning his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ iced sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a obviously broken woman , whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women , who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ sel &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary Citi@@ zen reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan was still lacking that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to frag@@ ile control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ structive violence , and for their release is often necessary for many years of bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman is not done . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , not to rep@@ ou@@ ting topics covered in his country as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it attempts on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; my policy was in@@ timi@@ dated me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everybody else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; that is what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , in order to note that his comments were torn from the context , rot@@ ates and his opinion has been cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but it was only a processed version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als did not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ an , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : &quot; if Abu Nu@@ anything , who should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , in the eighth century was openly able to write about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom , there is nothing new anymore that the government had brought attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be put into silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian secret service charges several former government officials and members of the teaching network , with the reasons that they expressed themselves on comments in social media , which were related to the problems in the land poll@@ uted corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to influence a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress has been an independent lifting and take . Jordan has gone a performance for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it is clear that this changes from day to day is held in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , as millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream about his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be related to music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not caused by bombs , spreading positions and at artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to carry on and thus also resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis , allowing A@@ man to hear as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; this big , extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous the@@ ories about origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
&quot; it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ v . another theory is that the Fest@@ ing , drums and dancing over a thousand years , came to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ ys , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for a long time the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two p@@ ans are straight forward .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre high tower was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ dressing course .
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , in the area of a very high crime rate , where road smoking and illegal drugs are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services to men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ ers such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hair@@ dresser in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers who can make these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers , which go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts against each other , to show who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric lights like you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitors on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school Augusto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people from their arms to receive their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice , which enables them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ et@@ ative possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession currently being in fashion .
&quot; before the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud because of love to the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of &quot; love &quot; love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write to love letters to people whom we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel to be stretched out , aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write gu@@ err@@ illa &apos;s letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the sig@@ nat@@ ories of peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of Colombia , there is a long way until you can talk of an effective reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who lived for many years in illegal camps , to have been exposed to a war rhet@@ oric and carried around the clock their weapons to live in the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeper hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa attacks , has now to support them in their ranks and support them in construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an were convinced that the young Colombia can help themselves together and the integration process would have to help .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands young people have written letters - love visits to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the Camp@@ aign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who should be handed in personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day for the Camp@@ aign
&quot; the idea for reconciliation began on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , who held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people who love to write on the day of thousands of love letters , but those who forget they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told further to share his love with men this year , which needed the most urgent promise . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was created to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to build their place in society and to create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make dis@@ course of a history of war on a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive anybody &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to overcome the letters to personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC did so , as they had previously done in order to oppos@@ e the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters of sub@@ ordin@@ ation of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can be run through only a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between &quot; &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters camp . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cabin in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written me . &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before me in my life , someone wrote something like this , that &apos;s why I reply to it . suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
&quot; maybe he was also sorry for war , it was sorry to be the years of faithful companion of this woman , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would have forgiven me for my mistakes .
&quot; but now I know that there is a company outside , which is waiting with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace is , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; for the start , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC gathered together for a discussion round . &quot;
students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice on the whole Colom@@ bian people have experienced how we can contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magn@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; those people who have never had heard and never heard hearing , and to recognize that people who were often seen as monster , and even hate those that were turned out often by their li@@ vel@@ ing and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed , have done so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
Colombia was given that peace would rule after de@@ priv@@ ation .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities will always give people who are prepared to rise to the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that &apos;s completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; from the F@@ ARC we now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ideology they listen - to rise over all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . among us who defend life as the foundation of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together . &quot;

&quot; homos@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ us region , are exposed to a great range of dangers - among others discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; with terr@@ ors , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which depends like a cl@@ am@@ boy@@ ant about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only made overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has conquered the international headlines after several months , after reports published in the Republic of the Republic , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities to susp@@ ect the susp@@ icious que@@ er men and in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; already since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; it became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so they moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group had experienced Che@@ chens from the gender equality of their country wife , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; for fear of their lives , she moved to the United States last days . &quot;
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ fer@@ in at a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone made from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he gave them no more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya who can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made by the whole What@@ s@@ App round . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing so , a few grocery bags from the back seat of my cars , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you of your uncle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya : &quot; how long will you honour the family , you shr@@ ink ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke last final in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung wing . &quot;
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the requested to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I had to prove it , going up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my gender , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people said once to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the entire republic is ashamed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she laid himself a stri@@ ck around his neck . &quot;
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into an apartment and few hours later in the window a car with dark window discs and a license plate with a 95 better .
&quot; after the third time it had happened , it was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends ski@@ pped the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something strange happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought it without registration without notice , without identification . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a fore@@ igner .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you fall in safety , only because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are on . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
&quot; actually , this was my room number . &quot;
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality . &quot;
some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements I still bear in myself .
&quot; as much as I wish it , I can &apos;t overcome this se@@ atic barrier . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really give me effort to look like the person who remind them of their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for this , I needed some recent information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
I talked with someone who spent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had not arrested people and tortured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives now .
&quot; so I mean , you probably invite her relatives , they may take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by the blood of satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sabrina : a friend of me , there was just not many . &quot;
&quot; if , especially those who have no good relatives or were left by their relatives to make Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not just disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radical . &quot;
OC Media : is this now only a guess or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m interested in someone who was imprisoned a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard has grown . &quot;
there has been nothing new since them .
they simply have taken them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was to be taken as these people . &quot;
&quot; however , until now , they were not presented as band@@ its , there was no reports yet . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed this man to shave ?
&quot; do you know if this per@@ missions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , took place in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair for ever .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization , &quot; but ultimately fell into the stone @-@ time . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were so@@ aked ; I had coloured eyelashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has never been trimm@@ ed just a hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ asing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ otto not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , if they &apos;re doing so funny about sick people . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did these gifts stop ?
Sabrina : so long until the Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking about mor@@ ality in television . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t talk about us , but above the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless - one could sense , as the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; he who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , concerned at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily growing . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go right now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ in .
I won &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA .
besides that I am still working as a activist .
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I use uni@@ form@@ ere with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I gi@@ fted it to hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for it .
&quot; I discovered these people themselves , when I lam@@ ed a retreat . &quot;
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ right .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens , who want to know with foam in front of the mouth that there are no s@@ alt@@ ars there . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have , who have the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ ers , who have the Russians also ; on the whole planet it gives them - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think about Tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that you changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sting . &quot;
these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ations to be accurate , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not be ashamed for my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ or region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ den . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : using permission .
&quot; the suicide burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran that is min@@ ted by poverty and unemployment , into the r@@ amp light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he em@@ bled himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that could rise in@@ ability to his family , such as Ah@@ mad@@ ac@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video of YouTube divided the moments , after he had kind@@ led himself . &quot;
&quot; some people made it fast to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the valley of the valley of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , there were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arabic ancest@@ or minority , and activists war@@ n before the spot that more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a matter together : there were all family @-@ fathers , who felt themselves on the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable , to feed their families and to ensure a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority in Iran living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it hard to join the native Arab population , to den@@ ying their lives . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took power in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the ancest@@ or region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable agricultural land for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy remains very slow , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and dra@@ gons . &quot;
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses to systematic jobs in local oil and gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
&quot; the government also built a multitude of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ oma are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness caused desol@@ ation , and to destroy the local agriculture and the fish and palm @-@ trees industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate under the Arab A@@ ce@@ zi @-@ young@@ ster rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are seeking primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and ended up 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and assistant of ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; of self @-@ moral discrimination under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become even worse , this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions do not take Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will waste access to all sectors in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs to earn her living outside of their home ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their pre@@ dic@@ ation and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the ancest@@ or az@@ i , as even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated at the workplace as the speaking of Arab language or the Tra@@ gen arab@@ ic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances of the circumstances which have to bear the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i , human rights activist alert , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to wait if the world guards and knowledge it takes .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the site of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the object of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money despite the same education as men . &quot;
&quot; women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women before or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination are still moving across many different countries and belie@@ fs . &quot;
all this is conscious of me and well known .
I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : if I come to speak of skin color on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I speak , what kind we have physically used , se@@ atic and verb@@ al , both white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are silent . &quot;
&quot; yet , however , all in fact that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institutional form of racial violence , which we have black women to be exposed to two times . &quot;
&quot; or beyond that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities , less than white men and women earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of dying , domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I want all men , all men and all human beings . either skin colour cannot plug the same rights ; on the other hand , I can take into account the white woman who ref@@ uses to take into account of the skin as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I &apos;m not going to fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ amm@@ ary , which always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected . &quot;
&quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot;
&quot; I feed myself , group@@ ing me , which also absor@@ bing me by cultural incl@@ ination of our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will not try to expos@@ e white women on the importance of your skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to keep it better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to eliminate women of different branches and limits themselves from the white Femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to destroy me full of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly , that inter@@ se@@ ct@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it &apos;s more important than ever before , we can define black women to our own ideas and go into the sp@@ ar , which are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana v@@ ur@@ ism : &quot; Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves &quot; ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ atic , physical , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m exist . &quot;

Pad@@ del@@ y vs. the pollution : mission of a man who protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is again published here . &quot;
&quot; in the past 7 years , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its community . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , whom we had lost , when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all the country feared that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution , and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ press Alliance - which works for it and works to protect the rivers , streams , and water routes in Iraq , as well as the local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the pressure and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker and multi @-@ media journalist , filmed and edited in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of its work is on pursued , little notable sub@@ cultures and is characterised by using co@@ oper@@ ative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities , their stories can tell their way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cour@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ rd e@@ ye@@ vit@@ ch ) , which reports about violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names were changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; in a police Commissioner A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that it was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said , their testimony would be laid to the acts , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , also the acute ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was also profitable . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife nourished her ad . &quot;
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women want to report once again , they do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who want to abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , victims of violence , must be at all at the prosecution authorities . &quot;
holding 1 stro@@ kes and statistics 2 un@@ seen mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not under@@ pin 3 of the laws : good approach , defective implementation and st@@ ats &quot;
&quot; it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the figures available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Public Prosecutor of the At@@ tor@@ ney Office of 9@@ 600 ads went for domestic violence . at 70 % of them , violence against women went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads in the police arrived by women .
&quot; there were over 5,000 ads for domestic violence at the peac@@ ekeeping force . 86 % of the advertis@@ ements were also added here . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women were diagnosed with physical abuse , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di are actually indicated only a few of these crimes . &quot; on every woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this because of physical failure ad , two women who do not do this , stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder had no criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the prosecution authority cannot be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
by August 2016 journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
&quot; the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not under@@ take
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was a fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then , however , it should always repent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she brought the psych@@ ic violence in one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time seen the most serious : &quot;
I never thought that I would have a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I thought that only women had happened to be under@@ lined , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana uses social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , if he had ever lifted the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why she had fallen so long of Carlos and left him not earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like that they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least one certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner she mi@@ stre@@ ated her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some sort of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; after all , her wealthy partner managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements were in the authorities without the result , and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she introduced a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; contra@@ ctual laws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the indication of ab@@ uses is a way of resistance , and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , the bill was discussed under the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # Princess ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Una@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ income ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law looks forward to explain Fem@@ iz@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and pun@@ ishing the case as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the legisl@@ ator has changed in some points to win the dep@@ uties for the law that also feared the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are generally forbidden in Paraguay , and to be sentenced to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had provided , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proce@@ eding to carry out the victims of violence at present , if they simply would only want to refund and secure a safe accommodation to raise the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not effectively be effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial funds for this purpose :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships . &quot;
&quot; there must be a re@@ thinking , so that violence is no longer considered a little bit . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , he is guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will take away . &quot;
we must refund so long ad till mis@@ use is not considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law passed in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners used in the cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are apart .
&quot; the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his victims . &quot;
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered great set@@ back . &quot;
&quot; this article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cour@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ rd e@@ ye@@ vit@@ ch ) , which reports about violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;

independent media in Oman launched a year after prohibition of a newspaper &apos;s attack .
&quot; this website was closed on the website of the Information Minister , on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , however later on . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had put his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then he held until his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief of the Armed Forces , Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the har@@ den@@ ial efforts of security forces , particularly domestic violence , including freedom of freedom to limit and human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and citizens , even activists , including corruption in public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until they had been banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands on the judi@@ ci@@ ary . in this case , it went to corruption in the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance property . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page titled : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bound hands in the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ a Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial board of the ISS , was arrested and arrested by the Special Department and on his arrival of the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had been investig@@ ating the editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Festival . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was concluded on a definite period after the information minister had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first negoti@@ ation took place in Mas@@ cat , the first trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the court sentenced three journalists to prison , and ordered the final closing of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of sub@@ distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; the excav@@ ation of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of infr@@ in@@ ating violations and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of detention and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) and was executed by a one @-@ year professional ban on both journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after having used the use of an information network to spread the material which could be a danger for the public order .
&quot; for Al Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was set up on 22 August 2016 ( 13 000 US dollars ) , and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appeals Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i , on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in prison by the central prison sentence of his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appeals Court also over@@ took the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself , according to the attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the information minister issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , giving himself the Minister for the decision of the Appeals Court to reg@@ ain the publication of the paper . &quot;
&quot; the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman has been injured in Oman at recent times . &quot;
&quot; for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent journal Mo@@ w@@ in and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to introduce its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive injury of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
&quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists were able to pursue their work ; &quot;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their rights ab@@ uses , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights defence ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peac@@ efully , supported and protecting them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure 1 with his consent &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area , which addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; there are two reasons for the need of medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global healthcare industry many medications and vacc@@ ines covering the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poorest countries , and missing investments in the study of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists in Africa , helps to establish its own research capacity in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Center for the Expl@@ oration of Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; in Zambia , he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about these research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being mo@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s even impossible to use them here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the United States and Europe .
projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to return or withdraw from here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
&quot; there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transferable and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries - based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and creating access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; plant producers to change worldwide food production
&quot; this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky , originally appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published about solvents worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred to the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ shred@@ der , the first plant , which have been cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was made only by his own sub@@ sist@@ ence and the question as many of the sal@@ aries of o@@ int@@ ites can get borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for the breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or green or cr@@ amped leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still takes let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs more restrictions on any longer , since his work is still more constra@@ ined . &quot;
it &apos;s like a rock bro@@ ods in a river around whom I must sw@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a fra@@ cture with a breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents have to go far away . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before court , no one can breed more a new salad @-@ variety because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and tried to breed those characteristics he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ving to use no material which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement that is increasingly larger in the USA , everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Bre@@ eding ) . &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety Out@@ red@@ k in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

&quot; it is not a coincidence that this name would rather be like that , as the movement from the IT area , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and cells are not protected as intellectual property , and are used for plant bre@@ eders permanently . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders may also under@@ take that others can use the seed free of them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to make business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to cross their seed , and it is not immediately excluded - two aspects which are banned by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger groups such as Bi@@ odiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to try the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we also need control of cultivation of ecological sustainability . &quot; &quot; for example , we need to know more frequently and more common fu@@ sions in the global agricultural industry . &quot; &quot; for example , we need to know how this vegetables is bred when this vegetables is bred . &quot;
&quot; nut@@ ty people , without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the open source Se@@ ed initiative are under@@ going to commit to other their seed remains free to provide , so , in contrast , seed and plant attributes can be patented . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies are at risk , because the property is still available on plant material due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material , which is always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , a director of O@@ ss@@ i , has found herself in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property , making it either not or less usable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; there are such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by dis@@ cour@@ ged that crops such as wheat in still larger style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants become so far@@ med that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or their color improves up to such as to th@@ rive in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing through more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions caused much worse pre@@ dict@@ able by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activity . with a total of four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is set to preserve the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not contradi@@ ct that intellectual property include other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant varied innovations &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan to follow each , as soon as the patent has expired . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions help others to come to the same result . &quot;
&quot; such protection does not in@@ hib@@ its innovation , but promotes them by the public more material and know @-@ how are provided . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the other way : 20 years for waiting , until a patent was christen@@ ed , will certainly be no innovations . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and they should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to facilitate farmers .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it &apos;s impossible to make us impossible , if we do not continue to use the best and latest resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on is distur@@ bed to the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the plants themselves form themselves , and as bre@@ eders have no idea what plants do that . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; whoever seeks a variety , will breed his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture , with great farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for their cultivation of her@@ b@@ icide , breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , make it possible to survive the most smaller seed companies - either to either reject it or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
&quot; in his breeding garden , Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads . &quot;

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that Bre@@ eders would be innovative through the avo@@ ids of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like me to produce new efforts , even stronger than companies that are patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent he is protected for 20 years before competition , how to make it easy for my opinion . &quot;
&quot; although the USA appear in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organisation in the field of resources , works in the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports it to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell its own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l operates at an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from land to land , absent because the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not easy to enter one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventi@@ onally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; but now it is a member of the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems currently states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed Map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published global alliance for the future of food - a ban and aid agencies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report which will have to do seeds and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food supplies can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a connection between the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize it . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods , especially care where and how anything is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played any role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we try now to clear the people that even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock the content on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est .
&quot; on the weekend of August 0@@ 5th the Egyptian government closed the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network issued an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information continued . &quot; despite this attack and the judi@@ ce of the Egyptian law and the constitution of the authorities in fact , it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was not so important that all technical possibilities should be exhausted to overcome the blocking of freedom and not to admit . we hope to keep our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web presses to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , also on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt anymore . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , whom he set up , b@@ ypass the Egyptian government to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; however , blo@@ gger , the provider , which is also native to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after having been arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he recorded physical violence against two students in December 2013 . &quot;
his article is mainly turning round politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada fell on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; it is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been succeeded to conv@@ ey the feeling of a siege , murder , attempted murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , blocking blogs , as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have shown that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have an effect when only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
&quot; but now , after having locked him locked and that they have afraid of words , I can always change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the Mu@@ ch go the way up to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities opened 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this managed technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , e.g. Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers that was possible by the circum@@ navigation of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we realized how the blocking of websites , V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began . &quot;
&quot; in such practice , such practices imp@@ lies to block the government &apos;s intention to block and filters access to the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation , in addition , will intensi@@ fy that the decision @-@ decisions are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population no legal situation facing against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .
&quot; the Brazilian army was used in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in N@@ iter@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day for day , newspapers in all Brazil with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard illustrations . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; Je@@ den his second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves are sending 8500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se @-@ called financial situation , the power sector in Rio reached its highest level since 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio famous newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision stated :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual balance , etc . everything , however , happens by the civi@@ lized standard and what only happens in Rio will be in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative to exclu@@ de our eyes as journalists in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the editor that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world , with war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper declares that it is provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories which will be controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the Editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , too , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoot and then ask questions to hide . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; benefit more than it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to draw in charge of the police force . &quot;
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as Extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ fake negle@@ ct of public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just his capital .

&quot; at the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP had to protect after several reports on poor communities and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio cannot be declared - by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; besides legal questions , classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls for the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . in this way , the entry into the territory of a &quot; fine &quot; &quot; which is a civilian point in the landscape and an object for &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ted spher@@ es . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blocking , mainly through the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Institute PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ lib in one state of the siege . &quot;
&quot; especially strongly affected is the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition have taken away , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre of Assad regime was pract@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , they have been controlled by rebel areas outside the siege of Damascus , which led the inhabitants to local or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food items such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms will not belong to the conventional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare of the Syrian cuisine . however , their taste of food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Board of Directors of the project , subscription Nabil , said on the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that I &apos;ve been fighting for three years now , and pushed this project , and pushed his relief , that it is now more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ seam@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to conv@@ ey 125 families of knowledge to pl@@ anting mushrooms , Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is based on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity for 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally sour@@ ced fuel made of plastic used to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the production of &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds , &quot; before they checked up their quality and whether they are suited for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a large tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach the fung@@ al breeding in different reasons &quot; : break@@ age of the siege .
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ catering , by eating resi@@ due ( like paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) can be used for extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese call for righteousness for the victims of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded of righteousness for the victims of fires , which were gr@@ asp@@ ed in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires from 15 to 16 October . this resulted in the government that the government was last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts , spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry monitoring system which monitored the forest areas by satellite recordings , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users divided the pictures :
that is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread throughout the network and show images that allow better insights into the skill :
the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of protests from Saturday was the requirement for a better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to settle the extent of tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al of the League of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did not exist nowhere : there are dozens of reports from open streets , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were closed down very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are rec@@ olle@@ cted in est@@ ities with a high level of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal to the forest form , which had brought the government to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ ted to the municipalities that saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a Lock@@ heed of the Law , which allowed the construction activity of the case referred to as the applicant via means of self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , which was built by João Sor@@ val in the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it att@@ enti@@ vely , that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of light @-@ burning wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , still continues to spread . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection Act of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents sought information or tried to contact us , who was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers followed the attack of the 400,000 users who pursued fires , the site counted more than half a million . &quot;
even the founder requested for help :
can I obtain any ME@@ O@@ G@@ LE MA@@ PS JavaScript API ? - Tom@@ a@@ hock ( @ tom@@ a@@ hock ) October 16 2017
&quot; finally , Google has finally made a contribution to help the site continue to function . &quot;

we will see how long it is enough ! - Tom@@ a@@ hock ( @ tom@@ a@@ hock ) October 16 2017

&quot; during a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years ago , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups had collapsed , which had defeated short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; just at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati sat , a 13 @-@ year old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghan for the last time with his family at dinner together . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother wasn &apos;t like it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was supposed to break . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the p@@ res .

&quot; Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the T@@ b @-@ e Wah@@ dat , had been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly rel@@ ap@@ lessly . &quot;
the Taliban were getting closer for their hatred to the Haz@@ ara famous Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again he found himself in a strange country together with other refugees and to@@ wed bags with mort@@ ar , which were heavier than himself to make his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , remin@@ ded A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we worked as well . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we hanged n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we don &apos;t want to dry at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ k homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went into a church that distributed twice a day meal . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that are found asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disast@@ rous . &quot;
the Human Rights Organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; it is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a admission centre , if they officially put an application for asylum - what can be applied after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his breath of life , A@@ shar@@ af helped out of these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after several years had worked in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put up his total savings in the founding of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this ran so well that after a while still another second hostel and a s@@ lim@@ b opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the first time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan operated companies , including cutting branches , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff mostly belong to refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets , however , are far beyond the Italian restaurants and retail trade , and aim to return to the country that he had to leave a teen@@ ager than teenagers . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I cannot live happy if I know my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities like all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af had also plans to learn the opening of a factory in Kabul , in which people can sell packaging and preservatives . &quot; thus , they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end of the stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament exam@@ ines a bill of bill , which pre@@ dict@@ ates that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would need to use the social networks , in order to use social networks within six months after a successful legisl@@ ature to register their full name as well as their identification number . &quot;
those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the final payment of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was advert@@ ised by sixty parliamentary members , is currently under the legislative , as well as the Constitutional Committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , a member of the Chamber of Dep@@ uties filed a law@@ suit in which harder pen@@ alties would be introduced to the pre@@ judi@@ ce of the President or officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ens@@ ation of the president and state facilities are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law would be such an act with prison and fin@@ es , the right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would have a political climate change in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom had been in danger since many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud subscription Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had demonstrated violence against the military coup led by the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 participants had been arrested for the same incident , four years in prison on a court date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because he failed to bring the prison sentence according to human rights groups to bring the accused of prison in the court hall . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups involved , head@@ lamps of such weapons , illeg@@ itim@@ ate , murder , and an evil murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza gathered the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned orders , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists li@@ stens to le@@ aked documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been endor@@ sed by the President of the Republic , which according to the plan expressly contradi@@ ct a controversial bill , the business@@ men and during the former regim@@ es by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that all un@@ lawful funds will be refunded . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ ate , poses a light to look like the pre@@ dic@@ tive plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the designation of his sources under the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press complex that journalists cho@@ oses the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the case . &quot;
is China to force social media users to submit their identification ?
&quot; according to new rules of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the social media in China require permission to write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the regulations , the registration must be required by the full re@@ els name . &quot;
analysts agree that this is to be achieved by the Eli@@ min@@ ating anonymous comments in social networks in social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese network citizens proposed in social media , these regulations are only sel@@ ec@@ tively through to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
will we see us in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia locked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ eks .
&quot; according to the Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ eks shi@@ fted to register with the state government as &quot; organizer of the information technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organize a list of online services that the government &apos;s publication will also be responsible for removing the content and force them on request for suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are present websites such as V@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ classic ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has Sper@@ m Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court , the blocking of Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to extingu@@ ish two English language articles , which support Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime Affairs and Communication had been closed because they were closed to &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ated with groups to join a political diff@@ user campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is blocked the website completely , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop w@@ ret@@ ched !
&quot; after this week , the government of Britain is located in the midst of a targeted consultation , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install remote control programs that de@@ cryp@@ ted data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ul@@ ted telecommunic@@ ations and intelligence services related to the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , consultation still runs until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
