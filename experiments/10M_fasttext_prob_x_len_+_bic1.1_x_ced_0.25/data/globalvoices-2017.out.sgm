<seg id="1">Although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors and run his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had become such a profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the grand Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-Student, who was the Supreme Court with judges who were his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after method Man," I was it, as if that's the absolute truth, everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only intensified my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you are always who you are and it is easy to find in a community of equating people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter concerning his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow-minded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops behind the mountain, how to say so nice."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague it express it, and publicly declared its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes that he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigotte person, asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bring Trump and his voters not in line with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic, people from all over the world, was a deeply believing man, with whom I was talking about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps was also voted by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "by Peter Bhatia."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Sus" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues, to accuse us to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those with them embodies my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump in his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they gave me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe due to its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either by racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost the heart broke me."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to signify the Trump-voters as racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"that is superficial and respectful, and suggests a inability to understand those who act on another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most know are, for trump voted because they want control over a country, which they disappoint?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with contempt on those who look like."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(d.).: as much as" rejection of white against all other ethnicities "; vocabulary from white in anemaking on the white and whiplash, what exactly does the big Van Jones called, exactly what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - what faith or background you like to have, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with complexity, religion and the entire concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America, after 9 / 11, the white man is back in the silence, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd of human beings."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, had my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd responded with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "the crowd waked."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a consistent and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan joined the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the park in Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music that is played in both places is not only changing the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">"music, living with the trash"</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular with tourists, but worlds away from the nearby presence of prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a couple of years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) plays in the community: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments, have found an opportunity for overcoming poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drugs abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots which started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hopes."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with shining eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically speaking at the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital city, on instruments which are made from recurring waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprepared instruments, consisting of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled under direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments must read violin, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times Favo ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, is reminiscent of:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as a favio thing, which he never had seen before: a violin made of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from reprepared material and called the Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who are with him and of him are the offences - like people in Cateura, Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from garbage to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fights.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that targeted on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices to common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that the ship had been using illegal fishing in the Liberia waters before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"in this case, the East African countries were thus upset up and slightly inclined to welcome a criminal criminal of this kind in its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized the ship quickly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permits."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the kenian fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region. it was not succeeded to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practitioners crossed and protect resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that the Prime Minister had driven out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" so we have eight countries that are spinning and work together. they change information and stand in each other way where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by the definition: what is caught, is hidden, absent because it is extremely difficult to rise. this is illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the obvious contempt of existing laws, which are to be protected by certain habitats and types, the illegal fishing ecosystems may have damage, which have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once again have been disabled by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the information between different countries, the actions in real-time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"you can exchange the individual countries, e.g. lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very carefully, if this move on the open sea, with satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this enables the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, so suspicious driving routes - about such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in ideality, such studies may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can be denied on the basis of these information then the adoption of such ships can not be sold in their ports. so that they could not be sold to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it then concerns significant financial losses for the owners, meaning that the illegal fish catch is not worthwhile anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, head of director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a non-governmental company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to receive an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, who lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate the East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has made one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, especially to attract the region commercial fishing in all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other practices include actions, such as sailing under false flag, fake licensing documents, indication of phasienames, fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-bridge organised control system," says Long. "" previously, a ship was illegal and a country could say 'You must not go on my port'. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'comm to me'." "and precisely this legal siphole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front work.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 examinations suspects."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has exposed criminals being uncovered, distributed by counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it persecuted ships and found them."</seg>
<seg id="128">"based on his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing via large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far in the networks of organizing crime "," Bergh says. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that is designed to help FISH-i, suspicious ships more precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed, also helps to send illegal ships to hide themselves."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which is also concerned with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"copeland, therefore, helps to build a system that combines different information on each other. it should help FISH-i to help discriminent ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Marine Protection Agency Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed as a single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who is doing where - this makes simply sense", "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and protect their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities can not only feel criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, who used earlier without a license are confiscated and hardly to calculate with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats increased by more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped to send Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose deployment is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these achievements." "the effect is so strongly that we can also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object in West Africa every year, among illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries gathered together for the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the goal is to have more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to announce his first major triumph in Somalia: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and have been banned by toppnets, which are now forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also contained in the prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Take of dimensional rules against Greko 1, they put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working way to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world of the oceans. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time he told me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little bell wrapped in a blanket, and ordered me to wear it. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver."</seg>

<seg id="236">"suddenly he pointed out to an open space, and said:"</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible to do a person to another so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>

<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were cast into a pit and was killed by soldiers and was buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told us at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>

<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>

<seg id="275">"I am always asked how my father, the leader of security forces, was able to participate in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never liked to penetrate into a house and stealing everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals and I answered: and you who ascended up cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against rage, struck me and cried:"</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, I accused me of defence, a fellow fellow in this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay mine for the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">"anyway, I was there to prohibit."</seg>

<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl with her home, whose mother was killed."</seg>

<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They would have been to be put into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why does the corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families to be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">"the disappearances of suffering is the last abhorred act, which one can do with man."</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was re-established, they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of captives."</seg>

<seg id="306">But anything remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clear it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought, signifying my father, was created during a talk, as he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the atrocities which I had to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I never killed anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly and asked me, what the whole overpowering patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they allegedly defended, actually were good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">"you committed horrible crime, and you compelled me to participate in a child."</seg>
<seg id="319">"he only said," "Well, I forgive."</seg>
<seg id="320">That was exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I resigned the first display."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the vast proliferation of translators are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for example, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and transmit the language skills to put it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active correction of the target language - something that is in case of native language. in general, the belief that translators should be in the finish language - not in the initial language - native language."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speakers should be translated into French by English - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese company does not employ any employee with English as native language that could make translations into English. this may be a lack of understanding for the transition, quotas, or the relatively small number of English speakers who are japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that have not have any foreign employees, let translations be unqualified. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>

<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, including the enigmatic attachment, are used often with T-shirts or bags, are used only from stilistic reasons - not to be understood or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but by large enterprises or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring regions of Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated because the tsunami had vanish all coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"yet, the Fukushima Prefecture witnessed a nuclear accident in Fukushima alone, just about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special report of Kahoku Shimpo clearly shows the progress of six years after the advent of the local government.</seg>

<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while the final has its final light against Fukushima with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelongu was still stricken in final spare houses, even six years after the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shelter."</seg>

<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agriculture areas, where only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, since only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear wave zone. ""</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do not deal with hip hop thanks to a series of migrant workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour has been able to teach mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres, to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live production."</seg>

<seg id="695">"the workshop will thus rise to that the young participants in talks about how" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable "or whatever you may invent in the sense."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the field of the family of Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered."</seg>

<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation have taken, the chorus will be sung in Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the students involved a little help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in converting, as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="750">"the reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa Kartells, pressed the stories of the conflict in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there is hardly anyone looking at the trauma or on the municipalities that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each body, behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds might never be healing."</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican News Portal animal PolÃ­tico has called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trade live") to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organisational crimes lets us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to drive many municipalities so many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" editors are explained: why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only need to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community for conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>

<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is great. and it's not normal that people will hear songs about the" heroism "of offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that something happened to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories will be naked numbers in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the injustice of man is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighbour that they were."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to talk about that they will not spare the tragedies, if they are not stirring and still."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network hosts their posts from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the source of the Word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin, or generally used as an adjectively" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar", "as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely laxative connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has made a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today 'Kalar' may usually be associated with racism, but the word in itself calls not automatically to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use, censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"beyond, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings, which have the same book names like" Kalar. ""</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaate Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>

<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hats is the opinion that they must be radically reducing and radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook should be analytic to spread over all posts that are suspected in suspicion of racism."</seg>

<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spheres).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these three nationalists, who disseminate hate speech, received a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not be long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Weeks have demonstrated that the censorship of drums often become a cross and mouse game, with the users social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative notation of censored word to express their views."</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a good intent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">"for such words, only more hatred will take place within the various communities."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India there are women with greatest care, to pronounce the name of their husbands or even from older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure of the husband and fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm in the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Odisha by a spotlight and violated her family and the village community after having responded to a married relatives."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives is also not common in their name, is also common in men. however, they have far less access to worry if whatsoever, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune, Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, and housewives, a unique club, and so quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone to discuss the enemy of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is run by the Community Video Volunteers and set up for the exploitation of the Patriarchs."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of their videocamera at the discovery of practices, such as children's heating up to the end of HIV- and AIDS Indians, and directs these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports that these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously to ambassador's ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, was of women who did not call her husbands at name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided on this topic, because she wanted to open the conversation about Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands, a spectacle is not guilty to keep them guilty and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">"this tradition testified that a woman respects her husband, and wishes for a long life."</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who doesn't stand this will be regarded as posture, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning of the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never been named after her husband to try at home with her husband, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini is telling:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned over to me and said I should call him now at his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started its first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked for all participants to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village Walhe in Maharashtra on the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women are never allowed to speak to their husbands's name. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini is telling:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole practice it was pleted, and another decided to release all the frustration against him and his family to curse him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the Adrenalexchange rate, with an ancient brewing, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call her husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next days, Rohini received a multitude of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini, asking what ideas they sat in the head: his wife could not stop to say his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"she was afraid as her mother-in-law, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">"a husband of a participant, was less understandable, and the situation in force was in force."</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports, such as women have tried to stop other practices, such as the traps of the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why just have women to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberred point if he would like it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only, and I heard him to bear him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but I mean they are now in a better position to choose it, not to carry it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion waky is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we're doing an excursion on any case of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make sure the women will make, who could hear what you hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes, they sang and sang and spoke about things that they never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"for so many years I have been working on these problems, but I have also worked on some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, never talked to be honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great, some things seem to say loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we have talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a vast inhibitor over a pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe, morality linked to Saris and much more, dingy Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they have decided to plan an excursion to Goa at which they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion had already changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly into rolling:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but stopped doing so on to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women wear Zinnoberred on their forehead now.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion wb know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like Feiling around more freedom of movement or their own clothes-election - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman is talking about home and other people talk about what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shancourgam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the State of New York, the ministers noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody has asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"it is, with most people commit an error."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Justice Minister to forgive logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable country, you can say that we should not be any country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had an attempt to escape from the responsibilities, a compulsory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons of Shancourgam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of what he seemed irrefutable."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"by contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns, which become permanent by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the river, the good old lyre of the authoritarian machiners appear again, leaving the democrats, leaving logic, because they are better to power their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end of the last week of Shancourgam, answers to his American guests have been given answers to our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions he cloak with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shancourgam to illustrate his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very thankful if our value K Shancourgam should take the effort to clarify this point if he was highly paid, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"on the blog posted his comment on the blog, he shows that it should be able to read the entire address of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shancourgam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore was rather a" "city" "than a country," "he declared why elections in Singapore are so unimportant, even if we are looking forward to free and just elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He promised Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" was not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanticgam who is a leader of a growing generation that makes such polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yev and the members of the old Guard, which I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanemgam, member of the new generation of Singapore's political leader, I have doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review defies the weaknesses of Shancourgams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Lord Shanimmune gam has committed a mistake "or was it a Freudder editor?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique and it is equally rural and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the Government of government, the statements of Mr. Shancourgam are serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people work their military service, they only defend their city but not their land?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the journal Journey of a Decade to affirmation, Singapore is and always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have a lot of people to be offended...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but this is not quite true."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"crossing the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is located on the border with Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink blue frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a target for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">There is a parrots in a cage in the anteroom.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signs for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez tells the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" mum Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is more quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would like to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she helps them also and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them drugs that they can not pay them, they are massive them with a balm that drew from long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived before a short time."</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answered with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States, normally to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other waymen from Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together, and that they speak to the Africans already on the WhatsApp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his position, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the Bustuet after Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again," he answers smiling. "we will always remain in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her to send text messages when they went to grasp her or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez, perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only functional hope for migrants who are travelling by Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the town, a torch will lead to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family moved to migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Bustickers can be sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"Valenzuela explains, that he knows what the guests are doing."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border about the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after being lived for three years, he was referred to a raid on his working place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, come from Central America, other residents open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tell me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to have money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a general practitioner, offered it her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all back for guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses consult the passengers calm their phones, too."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"today a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandma, she flashes with numerous photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there are one of her daughter with African hair stains who has made a Kundin, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old."</seg>

<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in Tianshan district of the town of Urumqi a cell notification, in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app is to get access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities used to use the app for more than fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had completed the app to be exchanged with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police that the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, together with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojan and Phishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online, and to remote control its own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">These app with filters for minors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"an app with these functions can, of course, can be used in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "or even hackers may be able to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while announcements on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, pressing ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme toes and surveillance measures, as well as routinous Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter based media outlet" images from Mainland China "(s of the boats of the" "Fender China" "), photos from a checkpoint where police officers were checked by a checkpoint where police officers were indiscrimined by the policemen as they have installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you're discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him, and you cannot withdraw your screams."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams was not enough for him yet, so that they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first capture, I asked whether the investigators had worked as a garbage, or whether that was one of the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables in each other, to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them rarely changed while I was still in the range."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice, why I stopped to cry out."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the Henker noted the cooling down, and found no pleasure at all, making it the next to an electrically charged staff."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity through all my body, enough to supply my entire district."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my seminaked body, which lay out onto the ground, was the perfect power conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">"after two terrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night."</seg>
<seg id="2080">That must probably have been at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep myself again; let's say that this was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, who came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens, and the morning light meets the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker." "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhaustive youth:" "my lord, my father must be fearful."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib screwed a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib captains the majority of his time inside; sometimes he snaps at his screen, time to his computer, and again to his couch. "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what you can rely on, there is a cigar between his fingers or nicotine lips to discover."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where she had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority and seek their altproven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapesmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian geants, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these themes will not only be found in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that reach from Damascus within Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limitations in his mind, and he can participate according to their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he appeals a special abduct against the US American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as" Palestinian gearing of the second generation "- so, even if he was born in Palestine and never until now was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life's life," stresses Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man," while he poured into two cups, it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions, on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senseless hot junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slipping is loud coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you take a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, one avoids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled one of the band Mashrou 'Leila to the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary report that support the Islamic Acting Front - argued the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts, Hamed Sinno, speaks to the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert tabs."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MEPs and the former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activism, which poses the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continues to use" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to slighten rhetoric, but actually a clear-crystalline reality reflected in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs Plant."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib made traditional gender norms to body by turning his vision of the fate of Arab women who have voiced sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a obviously broken woman, whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women, who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of" Honmorsel "- the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Citizen reached its peak in 2016; however, Jordan was still lacking that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to fragile control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of instructive violence, and for their release is often necessary for many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman is not done."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, not to repouting topics covered in his country as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, that he is his music that is full of explicit attempts on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"my policy was intimidated me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed", "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and" "Ghareeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everybody else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind market, in which one can get in his words," that is what you want "- whether it is faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgram Roya, in order to note that his comments were torn from the context, rotates and his opinion has been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but it was only a processed version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals did not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuan, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks:" if Abu Nuanything, who should work later on behalf of the caliph, in the eighth century was openly able to write about homosexuality, why can Jordanians do not? "</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian Kingdom, there is nothing new anymore that the government had brought attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be put into silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian secret service charges several former government officials and members of the teaching network, with the reasons that they expressed themselves on comments in social media, which were related to the problems in the land polluted corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the Hdaibs concert, only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to influence a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress has been an independent lifting and take. Jordan has gone a performance for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it is clear that this changes from day to day is held in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib dreams, as millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream about his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience" it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be related to music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not caused by bombs, spreading positions and at artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is done, Hdaib will continue to carry on and thus also resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis, allowing Aman to hear as a student Fellow."</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"this big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohov. another theory is that the Festing, drums and dancing over a thousand years, came to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>

<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoys, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for a long time the Meguro Gajoen: two pans are straight forward.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressing course.</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, in the area of a very high crime rate, where road smoking and illegal drugs are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services to men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsers such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to the experienced hairdresser in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can make these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairdressers, which go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there are experts against each other, to show who can create the eccentric lights like you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitors on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people from their arms to receive their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice, which enables them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the bietative possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession currently being in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:"</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud because of love to the children we have built this educational community."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of "love" love to guerrilla fighters "published by the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write to love letters to people whom we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel to be stretched out, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Young Youth Foundation from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write guerrilla's letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signatories of peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of Colombia, there is a long way until you can talk of an effective reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters who lived for many years in illegal camps, to have been exposed to a war rhetoric and carried around the clock their weapons to live in the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeper hatred against guerrilla attacks, has now to support them in their ranks and support them in construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia can help themselves together and the integration process would have to help.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands young people have written letters - love visits to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The Campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters who should be handed in personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for reconciliation began on the World Summit of Peace Laureate, who held in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people who love to write on the day of thousands of love letters, but those who forget they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told further to share his love with men this year, which needed the most urgent promise."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was created to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to build their place in society and to create a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make discourse of a history of war on a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive anybody '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the BogotArt Foundation to overcome the letters to personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC did so, as they had previously done in order to oppose the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters of subordination of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings can be run through only a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between "" told the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca Province, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the guerrilla fighters camp."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of cabin in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless I said to him," Hello, what are they doing? "he answered," I reply to a letter that someone has written me. ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before me in my life, someone wrote something like this, that's why I reply to it. suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was also sorry for war, it was sorry to be the years of faithful companion of this woman, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of starvation. "I never thought someone would have forgiven me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a company outside, which is waiting with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the start, students and some leader of the FARC gathered together for a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">Students were all grown up as a war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process:" many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the whole Colombian people have experienced how we can contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"those people who have never had heard and never heard hearing, and to recognize that people who were often seen as monster, and even hate those that were turned out often by their liveling and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed, have done so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombia was given that peace would rule after deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities will always give people who are prepared to rise to the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that's completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"from the FARC we now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"for this reason, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what breed, religion or ideology they listen - to rise over all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. among us who defend life as the foundation of existence, many difficulties will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them together."</seg>

<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which depends like a clamboyant about the LGBTQ community, is not only made overnight."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines after several months, after reports published in the Republic of the Republic, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities to suspect the suspicious queer men and in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>

<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>

<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people said once to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world, not just your family, but the entire republic is ashamed. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she laid himself a strick around his neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and few hours later in the window a car with dark window discs and a license plate with a 95 better.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after the third time it had happened, it was clear that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends skipped the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something strange happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registration without notice, without identification."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think about, you fall in safety, only because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are on. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">"actually, this was my room number."</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish it, I can't overcome this seatic barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I tell you that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really give me effort to look like the person who remind them of their past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed some recent information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who spent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan had not arrested people and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives now.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, you probably invite her relatives, they may take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require evidence that the so-called" honor "has experienced by the blood of satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of me, there was just not many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no good relatives or were left by their relatives to make Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not just disappeared, but specifically dipped to radical."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a guess or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm interested in someone who was imprisoned a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard has grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was to be taken as these people."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now, they were not presented as bandits, there was no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if this permissions and kidnappings of people, who heard a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, took place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia applied, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to lead us to the" Civilization, "but ultimately fell into the stone-time."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were soaked; I had coloured eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Sharia has never been trimmed just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrasing: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spotto not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, if they're doing so funny about sick people."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until the Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he started talking about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he didn't talk about us, but above the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless - one could sense, as the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who laughed and laughed before, concerned at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily growing."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitin.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I won't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Besides that I am still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I use uniformere with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we perfectly organize teetreffs, meetings, I gifted it to hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"I discovered these people themselves, when I lamed a retreat."</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know with foam in front of the mouth that there are no saltars there."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have, who have the Cabardiners, who have the Russians also; on the whole planet it gives them - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan fasten - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about Transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that you changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trusting."</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensations to be accurate, different life settings. "</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not be ashamed for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I'm so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the site of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the object of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well-thought scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money despite the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"women are still under stringent observation, if it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women before or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination are still moving across many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is conscious of me and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: if I come to speak of skin color on racism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I speak, what kind we have physically used, seatic and verbal, both white feminists and white intersectional feminists are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"yet, however, all in fact that women - all women - should come together to sing" their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing "to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutional form of racial violence, which we have black women to be exposed to two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or beyond that black women and women of other ethnicities, less than white men and women earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of dying, domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the other hand, I want all men, all men and all human beings. either skin colour cannot plug the same rights; on the other hand, I can take into account the white woman who refuses to take into account of the skin as well as the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and I'm not going to fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spammary, which always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I feed myself, grouping me, which also absorbing me by cultural inclination of our customs and customs, to drive their egoeccentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will not try to expose white women on the importance of your skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to keep it better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to eliminate women of different branches and limits themselves from the white Feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to destroy me full of feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubbornly, that intersectality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it's more important than ever before, we can define black women to our own ideas and go into the spar, which are created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana vurism:" Reclaiming Ourselves "(about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, seatic, physical, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigmas.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life neither negotiated nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river, whom we had lost, when I was a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all the country feared that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution, and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the pressure and importance of his work in a question:" "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>

<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said, their testimony would be laid to the acts, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, also the acute ad of Ada BÃ¡ez was also profitable."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife nourished her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women want to report once again, they do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women are also financially dependent on men who want to abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit, victims of violence, must be at all at the prosecution authorities."</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the figures available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the Public Prosecutor of the Attorney Office of 9600 ads went for domestic violence. at 70% of them, violence against women went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police arrived by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5,000 ads for domestic violence at the peacekeeping force. 86% of the advertisements were also added here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women were diagnosed with physical abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>

<seg id="2499">"since women's murder had no criminal offence in Paraguay, the prosecution authority cannot be adequately documented, as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries, and missing investments in the study of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists in Africa, helps to establish its own research capacity in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" plant producers to change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this contribution by Rachel Cernansky, originally appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine published about solvents worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred to the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outshredder, the first plant, which have been cultivated by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was made only by his own subsistence and the question as many of the salaries of ointites can get borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for the breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor green or cramped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more of such patents have been registered to more plants such as grain or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still takes lettuce, but he needs more restrictions on any longer, since his work is still more constrained."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like a rock broods in a river around whom I must swaddling.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a fracture with a breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents have to go far away."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before court, no one can breed more a new salad-variety because all features are already patented." he makes it so good as possible and tried to breed those characteristics he wants. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and striving to use no material which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement that is increasingly larger in the USA, everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (" Open Source "-Breeding)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red RÃ¶mersalat the variety Outredk in the "Greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name would rather be like that, as the movement from the IT area, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and cells are not protected as intellectual property, and are used for plant breeders permanently."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may also undertake that others can use the seed free of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean, however, that they do not continue to make business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to cross their seed, and it is not immediately excluded - two aspects which are banned by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger groups such as Biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to try the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg stresses that the" open source "movement does not work with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we also need control of cultivation of ecological sustainability." "for example, we need to know more frequently and more common fusions in the global agricultural industry." "for example, we need to know how this vegetables is bred when this vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"nutty people, without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the open source Seed initiative are undergoing to commit to other their seed remains free to provide, so, in contrast, seed and plant attributes can be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supplies are at risk, because the property is still available on plant material due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material, which is always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, a director of Ossi, has found herself in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property, making it either not or less usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby discourged that crops such as wheat in still larger style are patented as lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants become so farmed that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or their color improves up to such as to thrive in certain environments such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions caused much worse predictable by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activity. with a total of four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is set to preserve the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it does not contradict that intellectual property include other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varied innovations "." a patent is basically taken a plan to follow each, as soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions help others to come to the same result."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibits innovation, but promotes them by the public more material and know-how are provided."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other way: 20 years for waiting, until a patent was christened, will certainly be no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and they should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it's impossible to make us impossible, if we do not continue to use the best and latest resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is disturbed to the concept to patented plant features:" we do not really create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants themselves form themselves, and as breeders have no idea what plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" whoever seeks a variety, will breed his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture, with great farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of herbicide, breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, make it possible to survive the most smaller seed companies - either to either reject it or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"in his breeding garden, Frank Morton is looking for salads."</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that Breeders would be innovative through the avoids of plant patrons:" it looks like me to produce new efforts, even stronger than companies that are patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago," he says. "with a patent he is protected for 20 years before competition, how to make it easy for my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA appear in the" open source "breeding, the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which itself describes itself as professional organisation in the field of resources, works in the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "open source" seed and sell its own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol operates at an" open-source "license which ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from land to land, absent because the Ossi obligation is not easy to enter one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not yet a law; but now it is a member of the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos" "Open Source" "seed systems currently states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed Map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published global alliance for the future of food - a ban and aid agencies such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report which will have to do seeds and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food supplies can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between the Luby von Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize it."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods, especially care where and how anything is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played any role, so Luby." we try now to clear the people that even more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still unlock the content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columniest.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of August 05th the Egyptian government closed the website of the" Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about selections. "</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network issued an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the" Network for Human Rights Information continued. "despite this attack and the judice of the Egyptian law and the constitution of the authorities in fact, it was never so important as now. ANHRI was not so important that all technical possibilities should be exhausted to overcome the blocking of freedom and not to admit. we hope to keep our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of Al Jazeera for alleged" support of terrorism. ""</seg>

<seg id="2731">"however, blogger, the provider, which is also native to Ziadas blog, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after having been arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he recorded physical violence against two students in December 2013."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly turning round politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook commentary, Ziada fell on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"it is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been succeeded to convey the feeling of a siege, murder, attempted murder, unloading of the national Security Council, blocking blogs, as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have shown that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have an effect when only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after having locked him locked and that they have afraid of words, I can always change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Much go the way up to an end.</seg>

<seg id="2743">"AFTE also documented the locking of providers that was possible by the circumnavigation of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, 12 June we realized how the blocking of websites, VPNs, began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"in such practice, such practices implies to block the government's intention to block and filters access to the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation, in addition, will intensify that the decision-decisions are made behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population no legal situation facing against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
