this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone heard about Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
&quot; it is another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression . &quot;
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA has literally covered a nuclear bomb in Iran .
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who does not like the chapter right ?
the US government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has identified R@@ isen and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became the symbol of the government of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitutional , the media must publish the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect these information , and if they cannot protect the Mu@@ ch &apos;s identity . &quot;
&quot; so when the government of R@@ isen was ank@@ le , he did something that many cour@@ ageous writers already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , he lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though they are for many years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government &apos;s demands were dropped . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the reporter and springs can hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of fail@@ ing and slip to the statements , that could also do its digital footsteps for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , are worried about his own telephone , &quot;
&quot; the same as its e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ kers information , its credit card , and even travel destinations with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling , a CIA @-@ w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens to be condemned . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , Justice has condemned more than all US governments to stand before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how the problem can be a problem , especially because the government has become too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , nearly every article on national security became the result of that a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went into a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional interest , because the government has always more possibilities to pron@@ ounce all . &quot;
&quot; but as the technology of the government allows you to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better . &quot;
&quot; at the moment they can contact the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ no@@ ons , in the stuff . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that had not yet existed when R@@ isen wrote his book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is a Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source over@@ coming system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer that was originally developed by the internet famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , as the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send documents , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these will then be encrypted , and stored on a server , to which only the respective message agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot pro@@ cure more information in secret , and many of the information that would like it would not be available from advance . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments develop new spy technologies all over the world . &quot;
&quot; it is on us to ensure that not only technology ken@@ es such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility to give ini@@ quities . it &apos;s just important that we protect the next w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about mis@@ ses in the supply of soldiers , and of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm to the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t proposes . or a pilgri@@ m @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitu@@ ency rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data collection of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; revealed that the rich and M@@ ight &#93; &#91; enormous fin@@ es &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness , which means an explanation of 11 million documents of Panama &apos;s local law firm mos@@ ses fon@@ se@@ ca &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we receive a impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as mos@@ ques Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; in fact , we actually see the e @-@ mails , sharing news , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already been very direct consequences for the first time .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a ally @-@ ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad letter @-@ cast@@ ings in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
&quot; it claims that a track of $ 2 billion to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others , waiting for the next release , and the next reveal documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it sh@@ ines away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and M@@ igh@@ ty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret control o@@ ases by some few people used to hide their fortune and conce@@ als -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot;
I always feel like a mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ ord .
&quot; so it has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who behind this blo@@ ws . &quot;
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably because there has been no prominent Americans in this revel@@ ations , the scandal had occurred in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; but by principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , mos@@ ques Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a datas@@ et of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to obtain less information to start a company than to get a library identity . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees to swal@@ low up school children .
it has allowed to attack particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
&quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we would find out how all this in practice looks like . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent out a covered investig@@ ators to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators were appointed African ministers to buy susp@@ ect money in the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked us , that all up to an advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ judi@@ ces . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has taken evidence of our secret investig@@ ators .
&quot; it is not about a single leader , wrapped in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , established by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; to handle this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if there is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen a cl@@ ashes to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been cap@@ turing central regi@@ sters at national level , who really has behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ations and did not make progress that we would like to see .
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as means to take care in the U.S. and global for more transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are fur@@ ious , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches . &quot;
we need managers in the business which stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem , and use it to end by laws this type of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I completed my design studies , I made an am@@ ic@@ res@@ ale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he got the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just learned to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to be ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed and I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : Oh man ! what have I broken out ?
a wild alien in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of the bed , a tenth to the door , and my bedroom door shut down . &quot;
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art , which he bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teachers . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my vision angle completely .
&quot; perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood , were friends who were waiting for us to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people to lodge in my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let us take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ xed , my ro@@ omm@@ ates , and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create it , be afraid of fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have thinking about how we could earn something . we can sleep with a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can sleep with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , with a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded the &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ets tasted completely different , because we did it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red the whole city with them through the whole city . when we fell our last guest , Brian and I went to the castle . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could create a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a web site , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors can be seen when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite for foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket was ign@@ ite .
but did not do it .
&quot; no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
&quot; because we all have learned as children , strangers are dangerous . &quot;
&quot; if you have a problem , you get on things that can be good . we were designed to design@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design much more than just looks and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create by design immense trust between people who have never met before . &quot;
can design be such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a dietary sample , which degree trust we would like . &quot;
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your Comfort@@ Zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
&quot; now , I would like to feel that you un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
give your un@@ locked cell phone your left seat .
this quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first time .
&quot; for the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a fore@@ igner ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; most of the guests feel , if they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so who has now Al Go@@ res mobile now ?
&quot; could you tell us on Twitter , that he di@@ pped the president of the President ? &quot;
you can return the cell phones now .
you have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build on . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced to his name ; if he would have told what he comes , like his dog or his children ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments , they all say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ known feedback system strengthens the trust decisive .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait for both hosts and guest their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we set it online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is to trust one another , depending on how much they are related to age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprising , we trust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
the more differences we find the less confidence we trust .
that is a natural social value .
&quot; it is exciting , if one adds the call to a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation for common@@ alities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
&quot; in addition , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you do on . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one tells too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; get too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- is the request rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of op@@ enn@@ ess , for example &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity text . we also give tips to which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; with which we did not reck@@ on , the large amount of people who were more than willing to im@@ pose these pre@@ judi@@ ce . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : one need not covered before .
for us the shop is running very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties celebrated or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in our customer service . all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing more lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it &apos;s been hur@@ ting when I just think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that is heard in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction had only a fraction of 123 million nights . &quot;
for people trusted right to each other .
&quot; when trust works , the miracle can be created . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host went to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know any right . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in their own car , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over . &quot;
&quot; you can stay one even longer , without charge the extra nights . &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy .
&quot; for the first time I stum@@ bled upon this concept , I asked : &quot;
how does the thought of the part fit together with cash transactions ?
it &apos;s about a economic trade .
&quot; but now it just is just &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the matter will not be just . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people take part of themselves openly and this changes everything .
&quot; to compare it today , this is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would , however , if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if in every place you visit , a group would be visited , a group there would be a thor@@ ough and to show a pub @-@ tour , of which you have never heard ; &quot;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed by privacy according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like apartments of reason to divide together ?
what would that look like ?
what would be if cities have the thought of the common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities in front of giving us society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and fir@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government , &quot;
&quot; people offered now to the inhabitants . students , who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved . they were incub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start@@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be host to a guest in 191 countries with a fore@@ igner or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we know that you can find the right design with the stock of trust . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ judi@@ ce .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you view me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , subjected to a brain la@@ under@@ wear , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is true indeed .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media represent the fact that like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know any Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met another Muslims : it is great , you know . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ al@@ ant fitness fan , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as homos@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to carry my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lu@@ cy was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have dig@@ ged with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked question , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ ened himself with every reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel the feeling that someone has perc@@ ei@@ ving you completely , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
so it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , airplanes flew into buildings , people sp@@ ared from buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only attacked by my country , but in N@@ u turned me the works of others by a citizen into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the western west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I went to silence -- as we went to silence -- as deep as I was in my seat , and I feared the first time when Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard , and I saw the war@@ nings of the National Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Ask you not . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims were gathered to prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were un@@ question@@ ably , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who thought for Muslims , into the free break and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt properly .
&quot; because people , who attacked this country , attacked our country . &quot;
I &apos;ve got the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can really say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and ben@@ ign tumor only holds under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , anim@@ ator and Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; maybe a few parking spaces are free , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people with other faith toler@@ ant , and to show bigger citizenship . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people will not be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
&quot; during the radic@@ alization process we &apos;ve found that it begins online . as a result , the person is cut off by their church , that the extrem@@ ist group can make a brain la@@ undering , so that the person believes the terrorists will be true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ duc@@ ted their behaviour and ideology . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must join the people to join the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a Mother , I think we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS . &quot;
but we would like to add ourselves to their role as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you cast a look at her , it doesn &apos;t drives them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scri@@ ptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in writing .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had its doors to the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy that she had spoken , brought her to silence , and said her , her wrath , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger sense , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m presented the connection to God and their church again .
&quot; rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed their con@@ structive ways for a real shift in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she preserved them to join the IS . &quot;
&quot; it was an insight , as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerned . &quot;
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear every day affect our democracy on our freedom of mind ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear ourselves will happen at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you report a review news in which negative Muslims were reported , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only an academic problem .
&quot; if you look , when the mood against Muslims shi@@ fted upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this was three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the ap@@ ron of the Ira@@ q@@ war and during two elec@@ tr@@ periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to mani@@ pulation the public to exp@@ el the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear harm us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at dental Faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when did I become such a diversi@@ fied young man from my breasts ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been in the afternoon , as with an execution after he posted Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was just eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or were we staying safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a light decision , because it was about what America would say to our children : one thing that America would control us through fear , or one that we can freely pract@@ ise our religion . &quot;
we opted for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we started silence , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and moved out my shoes , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because the half of the people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I am broken . &quot;
&quot; these people were there , because they had courage , compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go on number safe ?
&quot; or are you connected to those , which mean : we are better than that . &quot;
thank you very much .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to meet a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what do you think that you may say that you are working a t@@ ED@@ Talk to work a thought with deep dive in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work , and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear as a rule , the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began a platform for Bast@@ ers , it is about to become a billi@@ ard business . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air packages entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by connecting units , flight units can reach high speed and acceleration in eng@@ th@@ est space . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ controlled structures .
&quot; they learned to wear bur@@ dens , to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the boundaries of possi@@ bile in autonomous flight .
&quot; to make a system autonomous , it has to know collective , where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ springs of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on top @-@ level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; and &quot; landing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a plane that tries to beat two flies with one lap .
&quot; like other Str@@ eng@@ gler , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ gates it can ho@@ ver , and thus has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping page . &quot;
&quot; a limitation of he@@ dge@@ cutter is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence such as wind ar@@ ches . &quot;
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the flying device doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimal position is recovered , and the performance can be improved by practicing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions that are prec@@ eded to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are well @-@ known as machines with a thousand moving parts that are gathered together to viol@@ ate you .
&quot; for decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled air units that had only two mobile parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ ru@@ der . &quot;
&quot; we discovered that flies , with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest way to be used . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ edges , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so that it can be stable , and moving in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear axle . to get there to fly , I have to put it right . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood to throw it right , if all of you look , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symm@@ etri@@ cal .
that is why he is equivalent in its alignment .
&quot; thereby , he receives the latest ability to receive , &quot;
&quot; in room to move into all directions , no matter what direction he is directed or even as he rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , he is complex , mainly in the range of interactive rivers of eight propaganda . &quot;
&quot; some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
let us see that .
&quot; if passengers should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this turns out in clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when using it , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong - an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics , or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if even restricted . &quot;
&quot; we will demonstrate that , by doing one half air@@ worthy . &quot;
the last demonstration was investig@@ ating synthetic shaft .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
&quot; every unit is white , where the space is and is self controlled . therefore there is no upper limit . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , you motiv@@ ate this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the especially safe machine there is a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types , such as us lies in the development and the development act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as memory , as wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe , and that it allows creative , smart ways to form them in so spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such a massive , economic and economic potential , is the dot on the i . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; ahead of 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are always faster , they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of tel@@ egra@@ ph in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , it lighted more brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies in the universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
but their energy they were not set free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time emotions and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
let us as@@ sign the events initially tim@@ ely .
&quot; about 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has emerged slightly : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , humans and -- God stand up with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ant black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as a mad gen@@ ius so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the detection performance enor@@ m@@ ously . &quot;
so they are called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the comm@@ en@@ cement of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation waves of the two col@@ li@@ ent black holes through the earth through . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hughes : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my father &apos;s father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at the MIT . he studied engraving signals from black holes and their serv@@ atories like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gravity waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cro@@ iss@@ ance in the emotions of space and time .
&quot; when the wave rises , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other gest@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; in illustr@@ ative theory , lec@@ turers lead to rel@@ ativ@@ ities in the theory of rel@@ ativity often creates a properly al@@ ber@@ ed dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us stretched the waves of waves and gest@@ ure . the stretch of an average humans was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this year , the lig@@ o @-@ employee explained for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length must be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a atomic fact . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os described the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are powerful . &quot;
&quot; physi@@ cist , physi@@ cist , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more than an ear as an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones . &quot;
this is quite convenient . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points coming light around you .
&quot; with tones , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble tones have a wave length of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things which mean to you much : &quot;
that &apos;s about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like clay and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now she &apos;s talking Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interru@@ pts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can do with them no simple pictures of objects in all .
&quot; but as we consider changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , where@@ with my colleague Scott are busy very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ ates simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render of noise &#93; I heard this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass that turns around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine this forces .
fantastic . fantastic .
and we know about it because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein is the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls which was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and the invisible .
&quot; much in all , we can not see -- practically or in principle . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why increased stars in super @-@ nov@@ as explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about all .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see there since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation waves perme@@ ate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would never look aw@@ aken the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the jungle will be covered by its own after@@ g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible until back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most import@@ antly , I am optimi@@ stic that we &apos;ve never seen in all things we &apos;ve never seen , we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we just discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found the first chance that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ erk@@ y kno@@ cking of our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o enables us to look at a completely different perspective on the events of all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
&quot; AA : the challenge is now , as courage to be as simple as possible . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great determin@@ ants and lies in the cat@@ er@@ pillar of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
before some time I tried an experiment .
for a year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; in front of which I was afraid .
&quot; no matter if it was nervous , me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on television ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to play with the memorial ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep speech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life to un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls out of un@@ explained reasons &quot;
&quot; as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress , from the south . &quot;
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from there I swear to swear always with them , as soon as you go to me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I make an effort very much .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently , I understood completely that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play with my children had saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream .
&quot; I am the author . I think stuff , aw@@ aken for life . &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create Cre@@ ire Television . I create television .
I &apos;m making television in a large style .
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for this to cover 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for a episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts , simultaneously in production , four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series will follow each other on Thursday night . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I create , and not only produced , so still ob@@ ese . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the bon@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing ?
&quot; no one , I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with this .
&quot; I tell it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you are now a company to take a country or a class@@ room , a business or a class@@ room , so you understand that I don &apos;t just talk about your computer , so I understand that I &apos;m not only dreams about dreams . &quot;
&quot; everything is a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I deep@@ ens in the work , there &apos;s no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops on a screen , when I painted it on canvas . &quot;
&quot; so , one thing is a high sound , a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , st@@ res@@ s@@ ingly and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when working goes well .
&quot; a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I tell them the sum@@ s that I write to writing that the writing is prepared to me joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong it does .
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production when I began to work and collabor@@ ate , to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you cannot stri@@ ve differently than the size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not unlike any size , doesn &apos;t matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a workouts .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it in question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear thing : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there , the more things the same time , the more things I know , the more I write the story , the more expectations it gives . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I need to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
I love work not true ?
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the linen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ taken , over@@ taken , over@@ taken , burned . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mom is a single employee title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
it is the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine was m@@ ute .
I loved my work no more . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , performed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ n , do not deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show , Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so , what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly infl@@ atable ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you out , the author of Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you &apos;re doing it is going to be one teacher , a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a teacher , if you know the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart is listening , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; South @-@ States wa@@ it@@ ators &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , than I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
they call no more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s bet@@ ting , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters , we have a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in lack of life , I cannot do anything except for . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything exists is sticky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ ist pins and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can &apos;t breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes to and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s return slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly da , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is here . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum of sum . &quot;
&quot; and now I feel , as I would know a magical mystery . &quot;
but let &apos;s stay at the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it &apos;s something we forgot .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the titanium shaft , which is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who are you if I say to you who I am , if I am writing through programs and television lessons and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
&quot; the bu@@ zz is the power , which comes from life . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are done to do the tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the genuine bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe I whis@@ pered God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child will play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I am making it a solid rule , so I can release myself as work@@ a@@ ws of any fault . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , as far as I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t play a sat@@ in , how to work . &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I rather am at work as at home .
&quot; this objec@@ tion is painful , because what a man rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , me . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we shave around in the garden , and back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst into soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always g@@ ain@@ ly getting to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I wonder : why did we stop with the games ? &quot;
you can also ! do they always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you will hold me for na@@ ive , for a day dream . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are just 15 minutes .
&quot; little ones would like to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they fall into something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it . &quot;
each one can put 15 minutes on the piece and even on a to@@ e @-@ off day !
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no cell phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my goodness , my world . you don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true that sum@@ s have to feel a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own children , it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I won . friends meet friends who enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; just for everything I had abandoned when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to see myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not allow for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door , the energy goes in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she ful@@ fills me and my soul . I will bring my way back to new ideas . I use it in full length and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sticky fingers , dinners with friends . &quot;
now that is my sum .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for this . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid that I am a Titan , I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
&quot; yes , I said Yes to less work and more games . &quot;
&quot; and yet , I have everything in a grip . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire is still burning . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the walls , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the other sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ m@@ um , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am the author . I think stuff , I wake up for life . &quot;
&quot; it belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
titanium have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery gin .
how most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to support self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery gin .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
&quot; a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; safely , they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain , to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons like the neurolog@@ ical function . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease and suffered severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was a senior chief physician and worked in the emergency recording day and night . &quot;
often I supplied patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mas and brain pressure is incl@@ ined at the skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas .
&quot; to save lives , one must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
you sometimes have to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
&quot; to let the cells grow from a tissue , it is comparable with very small children , that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you must find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean François Hollande managed to do it . &quot;
this he looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , mature cells . &quot;
&quot; maybe you know from the biology classes that stem cells are unnecessary cells , which can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small needle of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells kept themselves different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells but was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar concentration cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why are they staying for us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area , and then the cells wanted to cultiv@@ ate exactly how it did Jean François . &quot;
&quot; and afterwards , to mark them , to pursue them in the brain . &quot;
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the execution of the same individu@@ ality .
we call the aut@@ ologist Transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in fo@@ stering brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they had been taken completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we colored in vitro in the culture .
we could not stop here .
helping these cells to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity .
you had to take food pellets from a tablet .
they did it very well .
&quot; as they had reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we had the motor @-@ motor range in the motor @-@ motor range . &quot;
&quot; so the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just like it was done at people , they felt spontan@@ e@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ ids . they recover at a certain degree , just as in the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkeys that recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after tire plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results too .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can do it . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to see the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone may come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patient to carry out treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ entr@@ e study . &quot;
&quot; first , you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a big mistake , they consider themselves as of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy than the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to see them as un@@ changeable conditions .
we believe capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a flo@@ wering capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy per@@ ishes in us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was dis@@ miss@@ able to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- does not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ healthy friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe together with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a truly and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are brick , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened with our host . &quot;
I &apos;ll call it the &quot; twin peaks par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws his long sha@@ dows over the United States , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few can recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the ver@@ itable austerity and corporations that could be anxi@@ ous to invest there where there could be productive and income , with which you could toler@@ ate the debt and also all the things that mankind is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green energy . &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , G@@ quietly , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollar , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around , and absolutely nothing did to drive out the stock ex@@ changes and property prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive funds are the twin peaks that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest in a low demand that would not invest in a low demand that would kill him in which they would kill him if he is growing , &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances leads to the fact that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him . &quot;
that is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely poll@@ uting art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to develop our lives , develop human talents and especially all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles are defined democracy as a social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has of course too many of them --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error to minim@@ ize the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these connections . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she abandoned the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but rather important and crucial that they inter@@ fere with them the right to political participation in questions of the stat@@ es@@ ange . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long though --
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also burned down quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the workers , our liberal democracy based on the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy only came up , when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was confin@@ ed to politics , while the economy is the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two takes place by the economy gradually mig@@ rated the policy . &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians do not have more so much like earlier ?
it is not located on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is about it that you can now be in the government today , but not in power because the power of politics is divided into the economy and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of prey that is so sustainable the animals , of which they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated at the end of the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ ated by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows to invest heavily in economic demand and the Managing Director of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism , &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ els , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and wealth of mankind . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; reserves the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and the fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very strange .
&quot; the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be , that the working arms are only able to reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
&quot; capitalism does it , as he had replaced low @-@ low@@ lands by automation and robots . &quot;
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separated , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste disposal , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we have a re@@ unified area , otherwise we will show the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will show the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; so , the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he will survive . &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; in which machines are used and the people will stick its energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ eck &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimi@@ stic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to call you soon , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please make a capital market in which one deserves money , while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a workplace to next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and issu@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they are not working there , and employees who are working there , but not a large g@@ aps between investment and spending , and ultimately won &apos;t run up with twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please note that our national currencies could have a free fluctu@@ ating rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , will be issued in interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment resources are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
&quot; at that time , the problem was that it was not the technical means to implement it . &quot;
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally volunteer in which they have privileged persons , and Marx@@ ist because they are buried in the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ ore of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or are we to sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as a liberal Marx@@ ist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do this , the technological development will generate a massive decline in economic demand , reflecting Larry Sum@@ mer as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally in@@ hospitable . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have clearly said what you have seen from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the note of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , during the area where most of the business plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , when I may say that such pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to connect Liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical , which concerns the democratic evolution . &quot;
&quot; what can be observed now in China , similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of massive dis@@ sem@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious to share your experiences as a financial minister of Greece &apos;s beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , we say goodbye to the Eurozone , and the persistent den@@ ial that a massive decline in line by the euro zone passed , and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek pre@@ acher -- the way , the first suggest@@ ion that den@@ ial these den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers are within the Eurozone , within the European Group , continue to deny the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable , because of political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , you may need a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est marina ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , it claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the banknotes to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they only wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the tests that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the Money , who imposed on this policy , and said , &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives in Europe and love .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they did not survive , the released Fli@@ eh@@ ler will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this won &apos;t have been cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we propose the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you will be wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at T@@ ED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 medium @-@ minute walk of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for it to produce shows and contents of the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard turning sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located on this bend right . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation process of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows had this evaluation .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows such as &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after one has che@@ wed a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows such as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- That &apos;s what you say about that at the end of the turn . &quot;
Roy Price does not ask for the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes himself more thoughts about the mean extermination , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not inspiring . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like that , therefore , Roy Price wants to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes it online where they can watch free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and when Amazon gives free items in vain , it is necessary to get it right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching this episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they are watching this shows . &quot;
&quot; they are observed by Roy and his team , who record everything . &quot;
&quot; when you capture the show , when you start p@@ au@@ ed , which parts should be ski@@ pped or again . &quot;
collect millions of data to decide which data will then decide which show them should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and resulting in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of these curve is 7.4 and Alpha House is on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he &apos;s always looking at the search to find this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organized a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows them , what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided to do not a Sit@@ com above four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about an sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this bend . so exactly there , where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very competent , data diversi@@ fied companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
&quot; because logic does somehow says that , in all , it should work . &quot;
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should meet a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years on statistics as back @-@ up .
we optimized it through very efficient computers .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis doesn &apos;t work so , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we are more and more about statistics to hit serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company &apos;s multi @-@ health system ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if anyone is in prison in the United States and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , will be decided whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , can be really bad , but more years in jail are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not the fact that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data diversi@@ fied companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be used by data analysis of flu , bad way , estimated -- by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , this once again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data diversi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all of these errors , data remain in the decisions of life -- at work , in the legal framework of medicine in medicine . &quot;
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics -- an area , with some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to meet serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognize some pattern on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you need to do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , solve this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , put the individual parts together to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take up and again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to add parts again , and then come to a decision . &quot;
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces once again , even if the information is incomplete to hold a good decision , especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and mind , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to understand their audience better , what else could not have been able to participate . but the decision , how to make all these parts , will be gathered again and it will make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that didn &apos;t stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they went on a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they chose TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices but I believe things wrong when data start to control our decisions .
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and not to forget this , this device is rather useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before it was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; magic 8 ball &quot; is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at that moment . &quot;
I &apos;ll get it later with a technique demo .
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in the after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this doesn &apos;t change the basic structure .
&quot; so maybe the ball is more sophisticated and sophisticated and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is possible to meet decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging news that , despite the great amount of data still paying off , decisions to meet , an expert in which you do , and risks do . &quot;
&quot; by the end , it is not the data but the risks to land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
