<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA has literally covered a nuclear bomb in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who does not like the chapter right?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has identified Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became the symbol of the government of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional, the media must publish the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect these information, and if they cannot protect the Much's identity."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government of Risen was ankle, he did something that many courageous writers already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, he lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though they are for many years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government's demands were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and springs can hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and slip to the statements, that could also do its digital footsteps for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his understanding, are worried about his own telephone,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"the same as its e-mail data, financial and bankers information, its credit card, and even travel destinations with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and risens to be condemned."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, Justice has condemned more than all US governments to stand before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how the problem can be a problem, especially because the government has become too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, nearly every article on national security became the result of that a whistleblower went into a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional interest, because the government has always more possibilities to pronounce all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but as the technology of the government allows you to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at the moment they can contact the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afternoons, in the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that had not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is a SecureDrop, an open-source overcoming system for Whistleblower that was originally developed by the internet famous Aaron Swartz, which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, as the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send documents, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these will then be encrypted, and stored on a server, to which only the respective message agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot procure more information in secret, and many of the information that would like it would not be available from advance."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments develop new spy technologies all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is on us to ensure that not only technology kenes such as Edward Snowden have the possibility to give iniquities. it's just important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about misses in the supply of soldiers, and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint proposes. or a pilgrim-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constituency rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data collection of the story was published.] [the" "Panama Papers" "revealed that the rich and Might] [enormous fines] have been hidden in tax havases.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness, which means an explanation of 11 million documents of Panama's local law firm mosses fonseca"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we receive a impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as mosques Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in fact, we actually see the e-mails, sharing news, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already been very direct consequences for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally-ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad letter-castings in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it claims that a track of $2 billion to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people and others, waiting for the next release, and the next reveal documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it shines away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and Mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret control oases by some few people used to hide their fortune and conceals -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havases work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always feel like a matrjoschord.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so it has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who behind this blows."</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there has been no prominent Americans in this revelations, the scandal had occurred in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havases."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by principle, after which these tax havases work, mosques Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a dataset of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to obtain less information to start a company than to get a library identity."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees to swallow up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed to attack particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here at Global Witness, we would find out how all this in practice looks like."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent out a covered investigators to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators were appointed African ministers to buy suspect money in the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked us, that all up to an advocate of our investigators, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all prejudices. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has taken evidence of our secret investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leader, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, established by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to handle this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very comforting, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing could have changed, as if there is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years, we have seen a clashes to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been capturing central registers at national level, who really has behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentations and did not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as means to take care in the U.S. and global for more transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are furious, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headaches."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the business which stand up and say: "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians that recognize the problem, and use it to end by laws this type of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I almost abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I completed my design studies, I made an amicresale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He got the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just learned to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to be abducted in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" uh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed and I stared at the ceiling and thought: Oh man! what have I broken out?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of the bed, a tenth to the door, and my bedroom door shut down."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teachers."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my vision angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood, were friends who were waiting for us to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people to lodge in my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost plexed, my roommates, and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create it, be afraid of fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new fellow occupants Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have thinking about how we could earn something. we can sleep with a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can sleep with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, with a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded the "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure our cheese ham Omelets tasted completely different, because we did it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured the whole city with them through the whole city. when we fell our last guest, Brian and I went to the castle."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could create a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" we want to create a web site, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors can be seen when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite for foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket was ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort, would invest in a shop that are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">"because we all have learned as children, strangers are dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you get on things that can be good. we were designed to designate."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design much more than just looks and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create by design immense trust between people who have never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a dietary sample, which degree trust we would like."</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your ComfortZone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to feel that you unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a foreigner?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"most of the guests feel, if they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so who has now Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you tell us on Twitter, that he dipped the president of the President?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build on. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first introduced to his name; if he would have told what he comes, like his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 assessments, they all say:" he can really hold very well-locked cell phones! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-known feedback system strengthens the trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait for both hosts and guest their assessments before we set it online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is to trust one another, depending on how much they are related to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprising, we trust the people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">That is a natural social value.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting, if one adds the call to a person -- in our case by assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you do on."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"get too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- is the request rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, for example" Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm doing with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity text. we also give tips to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we did not reckon, the large amount of people who were more than willing to impose these prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: one need not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties celebrated or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in our customer service. all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing more limmerit than these calls. it's been hurting when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that is heard in the voice of the Anrufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction had only a fraction of 123 million nights."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted right to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, the miracle can be created."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that save lives, even though they don't know any right."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in their own car, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">"you can stay one even longer, without charge the extra nights."</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"for the first time I stumbled upon this concept, I asked:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of the part fit together with cash transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it just is just" "rental industry", "the matter will not be just."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People take part of themselves openly and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"to compare it today, this is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would, however, if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in every place you visit, a group would be visited, a group there would be a thorough and to show a pub-tour, of which you have never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed by privacy according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like apartments of reason to divide together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities have the thought of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities in front of giving us society and relations, instead of solitude and firing."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces included in the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"people offered now to the inhabitants. students, who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were moved. they were incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new startups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be host to a guest in 191 countries with a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we know that you can find the right design with the stock of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeply rooted prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you view me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, subjected to a brain launderwear, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is true indeed.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media represent the fact that like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met another Muslims: it is great, you know."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a sealant fitness fan,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to carry my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lucy was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have digged with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, asked question, doubted and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened himself with every reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever feel the feeling that someone has perceiving you completely, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eileen. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people spared from buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... ""... ""... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only attacked by my country, but in Nu turned me the works of others by a citizen into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the western west of the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I went to silence -- as we went to silence -- as deep as I was in my seat, and I feared the first time when Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard, and I saw the warnings of the National Islamic organizations that said," Be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Ask you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims were gathered to prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were unquestionably, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who thought for Muslims, into the free break and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt properly.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people, who attacked this country, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I've got the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can really say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and benign tumor only holds under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, animator and Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe a few parking spaces are free, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people with other faith tolerant, and to show bigger citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people will not be radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"during the radicalization process we've found that it begins online. as a result, the person is cut off by their church, that the extremist group can make a brain laundering, so that the person believes the terrorists will be true Muslims, and everyone who abducted their behaviour and ideology."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must join the people to join the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a Mother, I think we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add ourselves to their role as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you cast a look at her, it doesn't drives them what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in writing.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had its doors to the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy that she had spoken, brought her to silence, and said her, her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger sense, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists who promised to a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than accuse them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real shift in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she preserved them to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">"it was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family concerned."</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear every day affect our democracy on our freedom of mind?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear ourselves will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you report a review news in which negative Muslims were reported, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look, when the mood against Muslims shifted upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this was three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of the Iraqwar and during two electrperiods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to expel the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harm us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at dental Faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet, generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did I become such a diversified young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been in the afternoon, as with an execution after he posted Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">"Fanatism can not only be moral, but also deadly."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not a light decision, because it was about what America would say to our children: one thing that America would control us through fear, or one that we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we started silence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and moved out my shoes, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because the half of the people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I am broken."</seg>
<seg id="388">"these people were there, because they had courage, compassion and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">"or are you connected to those, which mean: we are better than that."</seg>

<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the boundaries of possibile in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"to make a system autonomous, it has to know collective, where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>

<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>

<seg id="424">"in contrast to most stargates it can hover, and thus has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping page."</seg>
<seg id="426">"a limitation of hedgecutter is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind arches."</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the flying device doesn't matter in what position the optimal position is recovered, and the performance can be improved by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions that are preceded to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are well-known as machines with a thousand moving parts that are gathered together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"for decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled air units that had only two mobile parts: a propeller and a tailruder."</seg>

<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest way to be used. it was invented recently."</seg>

<seg id="469">"ahead of 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are always faster, they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of telegraph in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"this short moment, it lighted more brighter than all the stars in all galaxies in the universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy they were not set free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time emotions and the universe exploded in gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us assign the events initially timely.</seg>
<seg id="476">"about 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has emerged slightly: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, humans and -- God stand up with us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitation waves, which are caused by colliant black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as a mad genius so that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the detection performance enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">So they are called Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commencement of the detector, the gravitation waves of the two collient black holes through the earth through."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at the MIT. he studied engraving signals from black holes and their servatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravity waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a croissance in the emotions of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when the wave rises, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other gesture."</seg>
<seg id="495">"in illustrative theory, lecturers lead to relativities in the theory of relativity often creates a properly albered dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitation waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us stretched the waves of waves and gesture. the stretch of an average humans was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. this year, the ligo-employee explained for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length must be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a atomic fact. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs described the hunt for the waves like this:" the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are powerful. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"physicist, physicist, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more than an ear as an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">"with tones, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wave length of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things which mean to you much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">That's about the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like clay and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now she's talking Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but as we consider changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave pattern to sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, wherewith my colleague Scott are busy very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulates simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender of noise] I heard this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass that turns around as fast as the rods of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic. fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein is the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the Alls which was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in all, we can not see -- practically or in principle."</seg>
<seg id="536">"Supernova, for example. I would like to know why increased stars in super-novas explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see there since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation waves permeate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would never look awaken the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the jungle will be covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitation waves, it should be possible until back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly, I am optimistic that we've never seen in all things we've never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we just discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found the first chance that we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauerky knocking of our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo enables us to look at a completely different perspective on the events of all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">"AA: the challenge is now, as courage to be as simple as possible."</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great determinants and lies in the caterpillar of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of observatory on earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Before some time I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that changed my life to unexpectedly. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls out of unexplained reasons"</seg>
<seg id="570">"as if she was a waitress, from the south."</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life setting in my family. from there I swear to swear always with them, as soon as you go to me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I make an effort very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently, I understood completely that the" Yes "-Sagen to play with my children had saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am the author. I think stuff, awaken for life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create Creire Television. I create television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm making television in a large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for this to cover 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts, simultaneously in production, four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series will follow each other on Thursday night."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I create, and not only produced, so still obese. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the bonfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I tell it because I know what you think, if the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you are now a company to take a country or a classroom, a business or a classroom, so you understand that I don't just talk about your computer, so I understand that I'm not only dreams about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"everything is a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I deepens in the work, there's no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set troops on a screen, when I painted it on canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so, one thing is a high sound, a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, stressingly and intoxicating, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I tell them the sums that I write to writing that the writing is prepared to me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with television production when I began to work and collaborate, to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum of God is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you cannot strive differently than the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not unlike any size, doesn't matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workouts.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I only know that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it in question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear thing: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there, the more things the same time, the more things I know, the more I write the story, the more expectations it gives."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I need to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the linen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overtaken, overtaken, overtaken, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single employee title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was mute.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, performed weekends, no remorn, do not delegate, a titanium does not exist, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show, Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so, what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly inflatable?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" Heul you out, the author of Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you're doing it is going to be one teacher, a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a teacher, if you know the sums, if you stop the sums, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart is listening, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-States waitators" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way outside, late and she says," Mama, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will say no, than I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" kittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my sums betting, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters, we have a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in lack of life, I cannot do anything except for."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything exists is sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, waist pins and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can't breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes to and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums return slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly da, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is here."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum of sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">"and now I feel, as I would know a magical mystery."</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay at the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the workmen, the titanium shaft, which is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who are you if I say to you who I am, if I am writing through programs and television lessons and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the buzz is the power, which comes from life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, which are done to do the tasks, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the genuine buzz is God's voice in my ear, but maybe I whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child will play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I am making it a solid rule, so I can release myself as workaws of any fault."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, as far as I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"don't play a satin, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this objection is painful, because what a man rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, me."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we shave around in the garden, and back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst into soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always gainly getting to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I wonder: why did we stop with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! do they always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you will hold me for naive, for a day dream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"little ones would like to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they fall into something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Each one can put 15 minutes on the piece and even on a toe-off day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my goodness, my world. you don't have to be the children. it is true that sums have to feel a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with their own children, it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I won. friends meet friends who enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "just for everything I had abandoned when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to see myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not allow for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door, the energy goes in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fulfills me and my soul. I will bring my way back to new ideas. I use it in full length and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I'm not the sums, the sums not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for this."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I'm afraid that I am a Titan, I've never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">"yes, I said Yes to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="780">"and yet, I have everything in a grip. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning."</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the walls, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other, the other sums: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this summum, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am the author. I think stuff, I wake up for life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"it belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanium have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery gin.</seg>
<seg id="797">How most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to support self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery gin.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">"a doctor, who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions."</seg>
<seg id="804">"safely, they have heard of one of the most well known, the" Tiefenhirnstimulation. "we implanted a electrode deep in the brain, to influence the circuits of neurons like the neurological function."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and suffered severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time, I was a senior chief physician and worked in the emergency recording day and night."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that brain-brain traumas and brain pressure is inclined at the skull-brain traumas.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save lives, one must decrease the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes have to remove a part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let the cells grow from a tissue, it is comparable with very small children, that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you must find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean François Hollande managed to do it."</seg>
<seg id="825">This he looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, mature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"maybe you know from the biology classes that stem cells are unnecessary cells, which can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small needle of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells kept themselves different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar concentration cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then the cells wanted to cultivate exactly how it did Jean François."</seg>
<seg id="853">"and afterwards, to mark them, to pursue them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the execution of the same individuality.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in fostering brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they had been taken completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added a violation and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we colored in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Helping these cells to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they had reached a stable level of dexterity, we had the motor-motor range in the motor-motor range."</seg>
<seg id="869">"so the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just like it was done at people, they felt spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic braids. they recover at a certain degree, just as in the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, they see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after tire plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results too.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know somebody who can do it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikat, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to see the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone may come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patient to carry out treatments and evaluate it, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentre study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a big mistake, they consider themselves as of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy than the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to see them as unchangeable conditions.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely democratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy perishes in us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was dismissable to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- does not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yev or the Communist Party of China, or some of my unhealthy friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe together with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truly and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are brick, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened with our host."</seg>
<seg id="915">I'll call it the "twin peaks paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain, which throws his long shadows over the United States, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few can recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the veritable austerity and corporations that could be anxious to invest there where there could be productive and income, with which you could tolerate the debt and also all the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example" green energy. ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I'll call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, Gquietly, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollar, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around, and absolutely nothing did to drive out the stock exchanges and property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive funds are the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest in a low demand that would not invest in a low demand that would kill him in which they would kill him if he is growing,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances leads to the fact that Ödipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely polluting art. all the unproductive capital should be used to develop our lives, develop human talents and especially all the technologies to finance," green "technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles are defined democracy as a social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy has of course too many of them --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error to minimize the importance of Athenian democracy due to these connections."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that she abandoned the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but rather important and crucial that they interfere with them the right to political participation in questions of the statesange."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long though --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is also burned down quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the workers, our liberal democracy based on the Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy only came up, when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy is the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable struggle between the two takes place by the economy gradually migrated the policy."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians do not have more so much like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is about it that you can now be in the government today, but not in power because the power of politics is divided into the economy and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of prey that is so sustainable the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated at the end of the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far cannibated by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows to invest heavily in economic demand and the Managing Director of the corporations are too anxious to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism," demos "[the people] expels, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and wealth of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "reserves the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and the foreigner."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be, that the working arms are only able to regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">"capitalism does it, as he had replaced low-lowlands by automation and robots."</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separated, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste disposal, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we have a reunified area, otherwise we will show the reunified area, otherwise we will show the film" Matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so, the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he will survive."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "Star Trek" "in which machines are used and the people will stick its energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Atheneck" Agora, "in long talks to the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to call you soon, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: please make a capital market in which one deserves money, while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a workplace to next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and issuing, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they are not working there, and employees who are working there, but not a large gaps between investment and spending, and ultimately won't run up with twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: please note that our national currencies could have a free fluctuating rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging economies], will be issued in interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund has invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment resources are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">"at that time, the problem was that it was not the technical means to implement it."</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a unified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is at the same time liberally volunteer in which they have privileged persons, and Marxist because they are buried in the separation of capital and work in the trashore of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we to sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as a liberal Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do this, the technological development will generate a massive decline in economic demand, reflecting Larry Summer as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am totally inhospitable."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have clearly said what you have seen from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the note of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, during the area where most of the business plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, when I may say that such provocative, China resembles today the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to connect Liberalism with democracy -- that's an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which concerns the democratic evolution."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of massive dissemblings."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious to share your experiences as a financial minister of Greece's beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, we say goodbye to the Eurozone, and the persistent denial that a massive decline in line by the euro zone passed, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek preacher -- the way, the first suggestion that denial these denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers are within the Eurozone, within the European Group, continue to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable, because of political will and authitarianism, you may need a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest marina...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, it claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the banknotes to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they only wanted to bring our government to fall, only because they didn't want to deal with the tests that ran through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression." "</seg>
<seg id="1026">"no one from the Troika of the Money, who imposed on this policy, and said," This was a colossaler mistake. ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you seem to be quite a-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives in Europe and love.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they did not survive, the released Fliehler will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">This won't have been catastrophic consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"when we propose the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 medium-minute walk of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for it to produce shows and contents of the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard turning sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are located on this bend right."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation process of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows had this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows such as" Breaking Bad "," Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after one has chewed a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows such as" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- That's what you say about that at the end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not ask for the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes himself more thoughts about the mean extermination, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not inspiring."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like that, therefore, Roy Price wants to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes it online where they can watch free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and when Amazon gives free items in vain, it is necessary to get it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know that they are watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">"they are observed by Roy and his team, who record everything."</seg>
<seg id="1066">"when you capture the show, when you start paued, which parts should be skipped or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to decide which data will then decide which show them should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and resulting in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom via four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of these curve is 7.4 and Alpha House is on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company, another manager has plazed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he's always looking at the search to find this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organized a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: which shows them, what producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a car and decided to do not a Sitcom above four senators, but a drama series about an senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has landed a hit with a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this bend. so exactly there, where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competent, data diversified companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">"because logic does somehow says that, in all, it should work."</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should meet a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years on statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">We optimized it through very efficient computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis doesn't work so, this is something terrifying because we live in a time in which we are more and more about statistics to hit serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company's multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, will be decided whether a person is good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, can be really bad, but more years in jail are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not the fact that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data diversified companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be used by data analysis of flu, bad way, estimated -- by data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it was simply not working, this once again was a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data diversified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these errors, data remain in the decisions of life -- at work, in the legal framework of medicine in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area, with some very smart people unimaginable many data to meet serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognize some pattern on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you need to do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, solve this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, put the individual parts together to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take up and again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to add parts again, and then come to a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces once again, even if the information is incomplete to hold a good decision, especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and mind, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to understand their audience better, what else could not have been able to participate. but the decision, how to make all these parts, will be gathered again and it will make a show like" House of Cards "that didn't stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they went on a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they chose TV ideas than they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices but I believe things wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and not to forget this, this device is rather useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"magic 8 ball" is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a ja- or No question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at that moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in the afternoons."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis, to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this doesn't change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so maybe the ball is more sophisticated and sophisticated and wiser. ultimately, it is possible to meet decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging news that, despite the great amount of data still paying off, decisions to meet, an expert in which you do, and risks do."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"by the end, it is not the data but the risks to land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
