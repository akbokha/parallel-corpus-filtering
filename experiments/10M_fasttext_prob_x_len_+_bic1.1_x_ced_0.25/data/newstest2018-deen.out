Munich 1856 : four cards that change your sight to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt is to meet young people today .
&quot; a tomb cap@@ tains , where the tunnel will now be excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small band@@ men generate the poor reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encour@@ ages exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if the maps are not present .
everyone knows that once had to be exciting because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead showed a green meadow .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer by Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than current - but therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
&quot; then it is distin@@ ctly , as towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich which one does not recognize as such .
&quot; the large over@@ seen map were used for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves . &quot;
these were written according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management between 1810 and 1864 and ski@@ pping the first survey@@ ing .
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; since the spring of 1800 , Bavaria has been occupied with Austria since the second coalition war with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave up a top@@ ograph@@ ical recording of Bay@@ ern@@ in on behalf of course - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally went off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , there were the present neighbors that created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph proce@@ eded to continue the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot;
&quot; the Ur@@ position blatt on Munich is from 1856 , and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to early / today , the capital of capital is most pressing . &quot;
&quot; the city has grown in all directions , and has grown rapidly . &quot;
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ merged , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 card . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was celebrated 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as the Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , the base in the middle of the city lies . &quot;
&quot; the houses are concentrated in 1856 , along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian peas@@ ant against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when in the zo@@ oming , a smaller map with dozens of lines and figures : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ine , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
small plots there are no farmers more - but small band@@ men of the plant &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green area is drawn north of sub@@ merged .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 takes place in the October 19th century , was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Ur@@ positi@@ onal blade one reads in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street names &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; At the Lü@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße once you locked up people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in 1858 / 59 , the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ al was founded in 1858 / 59 . &quot;
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the establishment of the establishment of his psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and finished , for example , the c@@ ops of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to tackle violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ old . &quot;
&quot; first place for 280 patients was first place , later expanded to 500 places . &quot;
sometimes this capacity was no longer enough - the foundation for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ resi@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ atri@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; on the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , youth meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order bought the building complex in 1920 , and moved it into a hostel with education . &quot;
&quot; located west , the football pitch of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was built in architecture at the origin of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ ees , who had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the department store called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a crucial change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Allied bombs broke out many holes in the city center . &quot;
a large one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a tomb cap@@ tains of the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof during those days and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn stem distance . &quot;
&quot; with the Schie@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole in the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Reser@@ ved for Missouri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ thing has issued a warning for coloured people who are due to discri@@ min@@ ating politics and the rac@@ ist attacks by the state of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which will come into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of frag@@ ile , racial @-@ based events in the last state will be seen and indicated here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recent announcement of the law of Missouri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately on minorities , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they will be beaten or killed because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist leaving against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under frag@@ ile circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol anymore during the journey through the State of Missouri , without being accused of crime without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report on the Office of the General Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Missouri , which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees inform about what might happen in Missouri , &quot; says Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready if there are Caucas@@ ia or the relatives have to know that they are travelling through the state .
&quot; by 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 pieces of hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ i @-@ report program of the FBI who entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain , a company for loc@@ ating or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) were issued by the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) it@@ war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the States of immigration authorities have committed to negle@@ ct people because of mig@@ rant workers . &quot;
&quot; the rules are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in recent times , stakeholders have applied the action as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ dec@@ ay project is elementary
the fishing b@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ aun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac CDU and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on the spot .
&quot; the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties , with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann , initially granted insights into its operation , in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many as many young houses and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative failure way for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; at the table of the Feri@@ h@@ ä@@ ste , exclusively regional . &quot;
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ dec@@ ay project as &quot; elem@@ ental important . &quot; &quot;
I can not toler@@ ate steep surfaces on such a way .
&quot; green land care for a lot of work , a lot has to be processed with the hood sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ ian operation and re@@ ten@@ ding these without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence , and is happy about the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I hope that the arm@@ or of the surfaces could be moved out for a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and do thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often in the cr@@ iti@@ que
a total of 25 pitches of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
&quot; the open @-@ up area is therefore 40 hectares , which may not be en@@ for@@ ged until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half of the leader was promoted by leader , a district court carried the village of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmer stayed 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of course . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann explained . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White , the best food is produced here . &quot;
the landscape @-@ coun@@ ties ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state convey@@ ance of incense .
the goal is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one from the l@@ p@@ r conveyor conveyor .
&quot; in addition , the fenced area should not be mar@@ g@@ able ( hang@@ over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the request . &quot;
&quot; currently , for the fishing b@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ vous project 2018 , the application for eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just 16 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the accounting area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; now , the White House of Tr@@ ump takes off the Statue of Liberty now &quot;
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these equally like every other - hence the sor@@ rows staged by Saddam Hussein &apos;s first place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic A@@ xt in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN concerning the proposals of the President to the dra@@ stic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller doesn &apos;t hold the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have tasted him when he had done it .
&quot; but he touched their importance , and in particular the importance that you have been attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his basis . &quot;
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta coated : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that sh@@ ines the world .
&quot; the poem , which you refer , was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is feeling properly , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the aw@@ ful words of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your weary , your poor , and to breathe freely , and to breathe freely ; the poor of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ating waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly stated that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and their friends , who used to place their words after their death at the base , knew very well that she was a high @-@ political action . &quot;
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and Americ@@ an@@ ism , in which they presented the feminine em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in a ab@@ used classical picture . &quot;
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , people wanted to change it from the right wing this long . &quot;
&quot; the big cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty advoc@@ ates that the American flame is in the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
she shall bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to shine the way into the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite a matter of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see how they had seen from the exhau@@ sti@@ ve , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible vo@@ y@@ ages on the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of human beings , seeking refuge and improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of welcome you have to hear . &quot;
&quot; and this is , of course , not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wanted to recognize . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of a time when just two Sc@@ ots of Britain belonged to the UK .
&quot; the performance director of athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; in Scotland developed something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue to find out until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
&quot; the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with him , what they have done . &quot;
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of the circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ al - which was to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen to team captain captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
&quot; her capit@@ als was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie , of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver medal winner , which will compete with their fifth world championships for the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Mu@@ ir leads five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will be participating at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to observe the victory for the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of her first world champion when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team capit@@ alists says that they are &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but also in some cases also among the medals and the Finn@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be team captain , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me , makes it something special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to Po@@ ck@@ les . &quot;
what is my speech regarding the capit@@ als ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so , it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it that we are again at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it simply will be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public post when you don &apos;t wear it from voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him because of all , from interior politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he respon@@ ds to criticism , safe . &quot;
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; in the year 17@@ 83 Washington declared : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we become like sheep for the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on it , more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online review was full of a reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary coat head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his elec@@ tors and play his ha@@ ar@@ less head following chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , blocking of persons , which come on the side of the Governor - which is a public forum , which is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ dollars - un@@ necessarily , and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing further than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of trol@@ ley or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ eted people using the whi@@ p online .
the post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , and none . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the parish priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ met , but she asked to hate Hass@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; I commented as pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and breaking the latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea as a number of people in the same theme , then they will be regarded as a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what are the employees of the govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time , when you had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn down demonstr@@ ators and to silence . &quot;
but exactly this happens just digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants to be crit@@ ici@@ zed for Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , proclaimed a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers dra@@ fted between 1776 and 1800 , and An@@ ony@@ ms brie@@ fs beat on his lead . &quot;
and even then Washington had anony@@ me trol@@ ls .
&quot; the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; Pet@@ ition@@ ing , who critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , have been overwhel@@ med by the historical documents that were collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put her silence .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost last year next year in the arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is named as a tournament leader in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reached its fame with this event , Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great state . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he made this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course .
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he has won in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since they had won them in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories come back from last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour in this year earlier this year , returns to the promotion . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also felt this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing back and I played a solid Golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it went so far .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six mo@@ cks on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free of charge , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by Passi@@ v@@ smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people died due to passive smoking of lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this result , scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; Senior Manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved his own study to this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ keeper prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and are reas@@ onably well in the time , &quot; says the head of the Building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of house connections , the location is more complicated than presum@@ ed , because in the underground there is much ver@@ itable , that is not shown in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is always adapted to the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;

poverty and death in the indones@@ ian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , they do not use stove . &quot;
she even uses a pot only .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife is often called a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen cr@@ olle is taken from eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where they also execute their daily work , such as clothes with d@@ ull water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed and many are drinking , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody wants to get around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hochland von Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,0@@ 26 elders fell to vote against the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and has foreign journalists or legal experts . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua New Zealand , with the eastern part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so se@@ clu@@ ded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is surrounded by wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from corrugated plates that were converted through rust into various gel@@ b@@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesia have made their journey here , soft , journalists and practically no fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans promised a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and indicates their vibrant , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; before that , we only had leaves to our body . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and alpha@@ bet in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort released $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua wood resources are valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of Alsace for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves its first @-@ level presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units aged between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
pap@@ u@@ anic demands are thre@@ aten in greater autonomy these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , Mass@@ es in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s headquarters in the 1970 @-@ s were committed to complic@@ ity in the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year alone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re saying everything that is in a report of the patri@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities in the previous year include , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular in a different report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia and Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied as Pap@@ u@@ as resources present an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim economic mig@@ rant by the most popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ resident who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has cost the native mobility - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market .
&quot; during his election campaign in 2014 , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , the Indonesian President of Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , promised to tackle the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Papua New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little changes has changed , and today the loc@@ als feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that righteousness is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorbike by the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should be able to switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in their tone , and later went back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk drunk , pursued the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers de@@ hum@@ ed into the group of children .
&quot; one child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult to hit that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ates the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military officer centre , to demand justice . &quot;
they wore shred@@ ded hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle and caught up a bird @-@ w@@ ang - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to shoot stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood has been heated , the soldier was sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released in the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I suddenly hit my wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the sphere came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the indigenous man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and sought his body to be sure that he was it , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who like many Indonesian only bears one name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repe@@ ating that his officers wanted to save their station only &quot; &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings were only filtered on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ y for the families of the victims and swore to tackle the historic ab@@ uses in Papua New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; I want to immediately solve this case , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto affir@@ med that he establish a extra@@ judicial mechanism for dis@@ closure of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E at the 5th of June in Jak@@ arta , and said he did not establish a complaint in Papua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; legal anto accused the UN for crimes against humanity , which demanded more than 1,000 deaths of war crimes committed in East Timor in 1999 , reported that 11 cases of human rights violations were already settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims participated in such claims with fierce in@@ consisten@@ cies .
&quot; I interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
&quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear , to discuss the incident . &quot;
&quot; he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting paintings are not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police attacked vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who spent 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
up@@ set vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by warning the warning shots .
but the indigenous people say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the amount and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital , as the last one has been delivered quickly , the TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house , &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the participating officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident in the Indonesian government .
&quot; lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ land of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of Papua soldiers , def@@ ending forces and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian troops . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the last few years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is the same except operating range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
keep the majority of harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of not@@ a were only 10,000 indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and new migrants , since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport of Nab@@ ire have arrived in greater number . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that are in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants . &quot;
Papua states rarely the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media are ten@@ sion@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns were not implemented to raise awareness and development in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists , trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet provinces of Papua and western pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Ae@@ oli@@ an Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been viewed the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to ins@@ ure the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
the people before the place want more foreign governments to take care of this .
&quot; when a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence on May 4 , they broke their silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom &quot; to remain in the meeting too , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia received a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say they will probably not agree again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he &apos;s surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the family office . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ people , apart from that , it is under the constant threat of an Israeli military , is located in arm@@ aments and health services . &quot;
&quot; g@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , had to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats of threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ gun led a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the body of a victim was buried on a site just over the police and military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never get righteousness , but at least let them not forget the persons responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us says with a huge head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ turing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in the world in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from which 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings flee . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that was swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries have been reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we are standing by fire al@@ arms and at the scre@@ am of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , a inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting broke out at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 o &apos;clock GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooling . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accomod@@ ations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident may have questions about safety of materials that are used in out@@ buildings of high buildings around the world , revi@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; an investigation through the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by the covering , the outer cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , she believe that the system of panels for isolation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ ade Tower in June could be a rapid spread of a fire of fire , with about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International tennis network ( IT@@ F ) has passed through its big Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , he was only supported by the two @-@ third majority for this sport revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis Cup singles will not only be supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but therefore also very estimated five @-@ pack classi@@ cs remain so far from the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; therefore , 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member states did not have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; you will continue to work on it , to improve the competitors . &quot;
&quot; not only for the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies before the suggest@@ ion had come to the final on a neutral site . &quot;
new from 2018 are just compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host law in the following round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are reli@@ eved in terms of training places , etc . players will need to complete the official media coverage before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1 of 5 passengers , prohibited items into the plane will find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flight passengers found that over 20 percent are aware or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited items to control points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally forbidden knives or other objects with blades contributed . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed , they have discovered late that they were ir@@ reversible with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was conducted with more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers would rather mis@@ understand the rules . &quot;
&quot; of those questioned those surveyed that they have tried to fly with something that was forbidden by T@@ SA , 19 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with fewer than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that have been deliberately powered by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent reported to have carried out objects with the security control , while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have also confirmed that they were intenti@@ onally forbidden drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said that travelers have questioned throughout the country , to figure out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ s@@ mu@@ g@@ ings had brought through the flight security and how many would have done it . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are the most s@@ mu@@ g@@ able s@@ mu@@ g@@ s@@ ware - s@@ wis@@ ely or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by security , those who were most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ afe what liquids they may take away or how much of it .
&quot; so , it is no surprise that the biggest crowd of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items prohibited . &quot;
a long time the people who T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla &apos;s customers cancel Order
electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are pleased with the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla &apos;s Model 3 .
&quot; so far , he has so far under@@ min@@ ed that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its un@@ binding reservation again . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ tu@@ ated figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the announcement of the latest quarterly balance , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k showed another , less glorious number : the cancellations made during the new mass market @-@ model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past months , Mus@@ k had often applied more than 500,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k was dre@@ aming : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is only for binding reservations .
&quot; in case of canc@@ elation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( 1000 US dollars in the US $ 1000 ) and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time , 45@@ ,000 of such un@@ binding reservations before , Mus@@ k appeared in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders will be related to the problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tesla supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , it should be combined to all models - 500,000 , 2020 , one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , about 1800 reservations are currently available . &quot;
&quot; who ordered today a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates it , its brand new , not yet tested in the practice tested production roads without even bigger breaks with maximum load . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to bigger del@@ ays , then the in@@ eness of the reservations may be the problem for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; then the company cannot hin@@ der our satisfied customers to hin@@ der , in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to emissions of the EU @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules for reducing emissions
&quot; one day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authorities to delay his previous decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce the emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities against re@@ ac@@ credit@@ ation faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous point in a Federal Court of Appeals .
&quot; it is about a time limit , which ran for states on 1 October in order to comply with the standards of o@@ zone by 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would like to accept compliance with a year to study more time to study the plan and to prevent the economic decisions in local decisions . &quot;
&quot; in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , a long time was a reliable opponent of demanding environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block regul@@ ators or del@@ aying the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the case of regulatory appro@@ ve agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA ste@@ ward exceeded his authority when he tried to ensure the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , to monitor the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduction of Me@@ thane le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his back @-@ revolution at o@@ zone standards simply proposed the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the States by the complex process of filling the new standards ampli@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; under former administration , the EPA could not hold the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then maintained by activists and others in an agreement with the date for performing parties , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt does not use his &quot; stress on delay and all others legal to be made available . &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; one in the last month approval bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure has not yet been commissioned in the Senate .

tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery @-@ site will be invited to the old cemetery @-@ area on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. on a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors from the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini pointed out : &quot; it is a unique charm . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle were first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ gian original documents : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the &quot; &quot; Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b &quot; &quot; and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the certificate of certificates , on the Tum@@ my mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
so people lived there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Office Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the town of Tum@@ lingen today , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the most beautiful settlement of the village . &quot;
&quot; old maps from the period around 1600 , these historical facts . &quot;
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was created from the early medieval owner .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church , held and occupied by a priest , remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit these suit@@ cases . &quot;
&quot; thus , he was the right to use a parish priest or Bishop of a new parish . &quot;
three alt@@ ars there were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger one of the two zer@@ ps on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell lasted for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later he had to be delivered in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were inscri@@ bed and the bells were stolen . &quot;
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops entered the church near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remn@@ ants of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing @-@ speaking countries . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve 1834 , a storm split the church tower and the half collapsed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent evil , the tower was demolished . &quot;
only the existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g was only preserved as a witness for the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em is the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn &apos;s successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
&quot; as organizers invite friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Kepler Gymnasium of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
outskirts of Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
&quot; for the alignment of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk before the cemetery takes place . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening beneath the shadow of the trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; put the organizers out the fantastic view . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and listening . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours feel particularly obliged to pursue home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ Organis@@ ator Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to check out w@@ ren@@ ders of Win@@ dr@@ as
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aves &quot; doesn &apos;t look any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned into the country . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aves &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) is invited to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it may be un@@ lawful .
&quot; the club argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentr@@ ating zone exists . &quot;
&quot; within this concentr@@ ating zone , construction and operation of wind energy plants are generally possible , but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy efficiency for the rest of the city area . &quot;
such zones should avoid a &quot; failure &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; just a few days earlier , the town of Vier@@ sen decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but that was not approved by the Düsseldorf district government in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval auth@@ orization of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim said , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , president of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
the current state of things : in front of the summer break the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette has decided ; a hom@@ olog@@ ation of the district government is still standing .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; this means the issu@@ ance of a approval for construction of wind energy systems is excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received since the last week in the district of Vier@@ sen , declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the circle takes it to the occasion , the matter once again . &quot;
&quot; however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circuit on Thursday did not want to express itself as regards content as the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette of four meters high sw@@ amps . &quot;
&quot; already in the past year , the company in which the City of Vier@@ sen participated in which the City of Vier@@ sen is involved , pen@@ dic@@ ated agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares wide area of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered , which corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ berg . &quot;
car and tractor kra@@ de together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has taken place on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between the square and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn Circle ) .
a woman was seriously injured .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained closed over hours .
&quot; following police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch drove their passenger car with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying the L 333 in direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home shopping shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region should re@@ discover the shops in the city center in September .
&quot; the commercial organisation and the city authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the inhabitants to the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend , the customer shall be sensitive to customers that offers its own city away from the usual market commodity . &quot;
&quot; thus , a market with regional providers are planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , native firms are to present their training positions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will also invite &quot; &quot; mit@@ ter @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this promotion does not only affect residents of the city and its surroundings .
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on radio , internet video and printed bag that point to the stock weekend , Christian King . &quot;
municipal Administration and Trade Association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
so the commercial club and the city will continue in a further stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive city . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with sell @-@ on Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers to Saturday and the loading of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; furthermore , customer potential will be new or re@@ signed . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many natives would have lost the city centre at shopping from the glance .
&quot; in the end , all of them will contribute to anim@@ ate the city centre - to land@@ lords , the ag@@ ings of all the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it sailed to overcome with a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which have been broad@@ ened , had said king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Centre in Mühl@@ hausen divided the third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; country in Mühl@@ hausen , the first five Thuring@@ ian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ hler , Heiligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should value for the appreciation of local trade and its importance to the community of our cities , &quot; so Stre@@ ich . &quot;
the action under the management of the I@@ HK and with many partners make sure that every citizen can influence its direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump put on telephone calls upon telephone calls from phone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border dam
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned limit . &quot;
&quot; the US President urged him , because he had den@@ ounced the Wall . report said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and swore to Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first angi@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an an@@ gled exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who immig@@ rated to Australia , had been &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; after having proposed a ban on the transfer of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for righteousness again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury passed through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver that could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man middle @-@ age in a needle @-@ moving - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; w@@ aked the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; frigh@@ tening , the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , was only one night . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience beat very real sigh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was indicted because of the murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really un@@ readable that in all these years , no one person was arrested , though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps them in the organisation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spots on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights .
&quot; for him as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community , that an in@@ justice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want pro@@ secutions , we want the end , we want to cure , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court @-@ medi@@ ator sets a towel on the ly@@ re of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to the FBI agents , who received the N@@ BC News were suspected of more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been indicted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects has been on the free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were always known throughout the city : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice offered the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to give their voice in the summer of the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ opo Roger Mal@@ com , a white fundamental owner , Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she bore , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when she drew near to the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached the car , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b got the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Harrison who was prepared and ordered the Mor@@ de , it includes a FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders of the murder , disp@@ ers@@ ed the evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you &apos;ll happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual delivery of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , striking , and is justified in a kind of pro@@ found@@ ly rac@@ ism to believe that he doesn &apos;t want to believe in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look and still difficult to look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we will be confron@@ ted with his hem@@ or@@ ality in us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot tell you any relationship , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to listen to what I did . &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - in a room and noisy as Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the Chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ co &apos;s role since years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story out of life , because we don &apos;t want to return to those days . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and pushed him angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ dy from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a wi@@ res the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least every black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the chief .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a . &quot;
he is al@@ ar@@ ming and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ icking . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at the time &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; I &apos;m wit@@ ness@@ ing one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and precisely there &apos;s the energy in the room , a sense of camera ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy making it right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene still starts .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , kis@@ ses , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman with a dress @-@ dress , stands for the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads to Che@@ ese Holidays . &quot; Strange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
her voice is breaking through every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators and tears came from his eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided equally between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the road . &quot;
they all experienced almost eight hours of Georgia when Bro@@ oks they lead them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the murders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air is sp@@ un . &quot;
&quot; when the last editions of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and inspec@@ t the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the fake blood , and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ m@@ ously a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a couple of minutes Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ x rope and wi@@ pe her tears off .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit that the C@@ lan@@ member has played . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ced two of his colleagues and breaks into her arms weeping and the emotional load of the performance was finally breaking through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sit together with the actors together .
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta excited about the reproduction with a black pair , which they had to know . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... by people that look like you , and they do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x still continues &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone holds Bro@@ oks &apos;s courtyard at his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he began to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the horror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is as if we learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k , &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is set up on a colourful , six @-@ story back@@ drop . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) features an upright street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car to pose an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine will pose as rock@@ ers as rock@@ ers , or alternatively an is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; oil subjects remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ um@@ ni - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they se@@ duce Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , mur@@ m@@ ns in Hollywood mania a body in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
&quot; in Hagen , Stephen M@@ illing sings the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight loss . &quot;
brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
later he must still believe Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ ductor Jan@@ owski , who for@@ getting his humble and his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty recreational clothing . &quot;
the gig was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ Ter@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to be able to leave the whi@@ st@@ ating pipe concert in 2013 , five years later , in which the single &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; had been signed . &quot;
Festival in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased .
&quot; it is noted that the audience has grown with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its sight . &quot;
I draw a positive res@@ ume .
Max Quant@@ works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work at several sites in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once in the week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide range that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; now , they are 26 years old , a late professional volunteer . &quot;
how does it come ?
quantity : I &apos;ve done SL@@ C .
&quot; and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say successful . &quot;
&quot; I recognized it for me , that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; a social year there is an insight , there you can see how it may be on the spot , in the burning point too , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual @-@ speaking , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;

&quot; the company , which had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy Attack of Kabul : NATO Sol@@ dier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; a military con@@ voy , attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killing a soldier of Nato and several others , officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been injured and an explanation of Nato .
&quot; in un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were also killed in the incident at Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that met Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion of NATO , the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan Army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; worn by persons &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state are to be treated in the U.S. military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dent to say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide @-@ car bomb killed at least 30 people in an mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul . &quot;
the Taliban said they would have executed this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , which led the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the Prussian safety situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of US troops to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dent to say that the suicide attacks in Kabul is also caused by a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies , and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ts decision to delay the tu@@ g rule after Kl@@ agen@@ um
&quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the government &apos;s government regulation , which states that the states are obliged to con@@ strain the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the step@@ ping . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; on Wednesday , and said they show the obligation to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA Chef Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to be determined to determine which one of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant standards must be delayed - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday , and said that effort should be illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ locate a wide range of environmental impacts , which the former president Barack Obama has imposed as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the return of the Democrats and nature groups that are concerned about the impact of larger emissions in public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that the breath of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function &quot; and can increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
Mun@@ der@@ at wants to be common
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : at the end of the vote , the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ es decides to establish the establishment of a community living room . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing plot was signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still to last until the church &apos;s church is now owned , but there is now no plans for planning for the project from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot;
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with about 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the Municipal Council , in front of such a common room , is not regarded as a meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ent living , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn . &quot;
the building is located in the san@@ itation area .
&quot; thus , T@@ j@@ aden was reported to set up a share of 60 percent , with 60 per cent . &quot;
&quot; the decision was looking forward to sign@@ aling the investor that there is no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , which is similar to him in this regard , that both ar@@ tic - which reduces both the height of the environment - as well as the pit height - as well as the building power - as possible . &quot;
&quot; so , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , this addition is this additi@@ ve . &quot;
if it helps : unanimously he happens the body .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one is not going on , right now when the common room come out of the window , she says , &quot; I do so difficult to do so . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it behind a conce@@ al sub@@ sid@@ y of compens@@ ating or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you don &apos;t give a supplement but will receive a real , in doubt , the opposite is the counter . &quot;
&quot; according to the request , the decisions apply accordingly to the decisions , three advoc@@ ates finds . &quot;
&quot; for example , it remains with two opponents of the original program which summar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision we make a huge step , we make a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler turns on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by car in Gar@@ ath from a car and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year old Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been around 12.@@ 20 pm with his bike on the cycling way of the Schwar@@ zer road towards Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street on the Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
one in the same direction of driving passenger cars was granted to him .
&quot; however , when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder passed on the road , he did not seem to be aware of the counter@@ parts . &quot;
he joined the car with a car that was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was denied on the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a ret@@ tu@@ bing car .

trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must aband@@ on David Al@@ aba in Du@@ el with B@@ V@@ B .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes an increase in performance in the first official record of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great trust that my team shows this qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to be intelligent , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , divided the German soccer league ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in Har@@ z from Star to Stern
&quot; in Har@@ z , the nationwide &quot; star @-@ path &quot; is supposed to be created . &quot;
this is planning the club Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star @-@ path &quot; comes to meet the information needs of many har@@ z@@ ers .
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up on the planned route plates and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; during the first phase to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reaching installations to five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards will be added to the Internet .
that is why the site selection plays a good mobile network reception .
also accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star Train has to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experienced much knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although he was still far away . &quot;
also will also be convey@@ ed in which constellation can be found out and when he is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest mountain ob@@ servatory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of the National Park , Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy is clearly visible with a mere eye .
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , since 2003 , it has been on the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen , something similar to the planned ast@@ oun@@ cement of the planet . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet road leads up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality Equ@@ al ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stel@@ ae with the individual planets , including the Zwerg@@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end@@ point - are exactly positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters away , the sun measures approx . 70 centi@@ meters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
&quot; while the sun is needed by the sun to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up to the plug with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are so faster than the light in the universe .
but the march to the next fixed star would take another half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should be staged in a coll@@ ision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; you were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbe@@ aten World Bo@@ xing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , the corridor went down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ spring champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory by unanim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters members are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; he stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters &quot; would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for bronze &#91; on 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get out of light .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they ask the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate polit@@ ely asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year , in order to make a date entitled &quot; &quot; Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell &quot; &quot; in the next summer with Garcia to the winner of the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have been asked to him , &quot; &quot; said Garcia , and later he began to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; he told Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he will possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think , the Thir@@ teen champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side see , &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you want to see the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; he said , the focus would be to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the moment@@ um that built themselves for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the fight that needs to be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Garcia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Lost to tire plat@@ ters
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost against 16 : 30 minutes before the connection station , probably after a tire @-@ placed control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car dra@@ gged to the right to the left , where he over@@ threw himself and then lying on the roof in the barbecue . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the last by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked towards the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hop@@ ed for the season 2 : 2 to the end of the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig for the optim@@ isation of def@@ en@@ closures in Au@@ e .
&quot; with the first seasonal game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge mountains , the rotation chain should also be optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a fool after a fre@@ igh@@ te@@ ousness , the Fort@@ un@@ ae would like to catch even more . &quot;
for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) is on the line .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better after the experience in preparation with the turning chain , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; yet , I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is his thing for sure , &quot; because we just can build on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ious and we do not afford so many ab@@ orted errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak after a susp@@ icious start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; however , if we can focus on Sunday with four points and we can certainly concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
but his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; I only ass@@ aul@@ ted the start to the season , I didn &apos;t want to speak after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who does not want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be cancelled due to a temp@@ est . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home match , &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be more fresh as they could not have a heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against a ascension day in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as much as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defense of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the En@@ counter ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we go away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to propose from the out@@ set , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such statement would be arro@@ gant and excessive . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel wants to see his player on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Phar@@ ts@@ as ) has begun with the test of tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they are supposed to be more precise , after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ational authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) was critic@@ ised because of the assessment of the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations has shipped 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person might be &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is under 18 years old .
tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is asked .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are durable in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the last months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ eth over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that they propose that it was 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , which are made of knee @-@ teeth and MRI images , which are analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , too . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
&quot; to assess the biological age in this way , it is very un@@ reliable . &quot;
&quot; if we cannot say it for sure we should not do so , as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of an adult child is sin@@ c@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is in this , if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Department of Transport Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time at all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the tim@@ etable is adher@@ ed to .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three building works are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side , a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons is heavy so called Br@@ ück@@ ene . &quot;
this is a boundary that is used as a factory path .
&quot; on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge was used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to pass .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge beams .
special finger@@ nail sensation has the wiring of lines through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of hands over the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building building and the collection in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; was locked . &quot;
the cost of the three Br@@ ück@@ ens@@ an@@ ations amount to 700 000 euros .
financed by the country .
Af@@ gan@@ ce in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t come so frequently that parties going on a beach , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance to show this day peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell is invited to a poster &quot; great election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names beginning at the start - such as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ d@@ land , will be the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already in front of the event before the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D , but demonstrated . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well @-@ place , but now there will be on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the African event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a bun@@ ch picture that offers .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the chairman of the Forum A world and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people are joined here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him . &quot;
&quot; the police has designated many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot;
so how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D volcanoes in order to find such an event and get the supplement for such an event .
&quot; the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking spaces are available . &quot;
so the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ i is happy that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
&quot; this is also done : at 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ ull Af@@ D chair@@ woman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners that are waiting for the leading can@@ di@@ ers for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police remains unchanged , but so far , the officials had a peaceful evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a long breath , but also there is a short trip after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can turn off - no special inci@@ dents .

&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets the classical German education with roots in the wind music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and pri@@ ze@@ winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in the European elite orchestra .
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire , not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach with the two like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &quot; world music , united with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ aters , mix classical , jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall art work . &quot;
this key piece of the program was first performed in spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ aters has written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acou@@ stics is conscious of the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and will eat it until the end of their life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is very openly about her bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood @-@ stars was that of their &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who ultimately hit bitter .
&quot; despite all , the brun@@ ette is covered with the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with all who I noticed . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten gave birth to bis@@ exual : &quot; I always lived on du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or han@@ dicapped me .
&quot; I never liked it , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school time she was rather disgu@@ ised as a book : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a book . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
now I look back and I think : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t love to love their love : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and maybe I call me some und@@ ank@@ le , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Governor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump to change his party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; governor Justice said . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a inhabit@@ ant of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Governor . &quot;
the manifest@@ ation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a major announcement at West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice didn &apos;t accept the democratic candidates of Hillary Clinton .
Justice according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected in 2016 .
&quot; Forbes states that he has inherited carbon dioxide in five states , and inherited a carbon business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee made a statement on Thursday night in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us rather than to do our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ s and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice only is the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , reas@@ oning message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ woman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honour@@ able &quot; Russian debt for D@@ oping scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use of Russia to a d@@ oping scandal , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in the sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics World Championships that the associations of his country was correct in the sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes with the competitions gold and silver medals were cut off . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) critics on government @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced a few hot times , and everything will do to make sure that the Federation shall be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; CO@@ E said , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for re@@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think that progress were achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the withered system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the Athletics Championships , which will start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral player . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia should still be some of the criteria for re@@ setup . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited coach are still free , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; funeral proc@@ ession in Mali , killed soldiers &quot;
&quot; during a funeral proc@@ ession in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two have been surrounded by helicop@@ ters in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .
&quot; to the still un@@ clari@@ fied crash , Defence Minister Ursula of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing . &quot;
but they called the two en@@ cir@@ cled pilots as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their expertise . &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Car@@ de@@ capit@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
&quot; their sm@@ ells were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a death @-@ wake of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the families in the church started farewell . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral proc@@ ession began in the circle of family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
among them also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Inspec@@ torate of the German army Volker Wie@@ ker .
&quot; mour@@ ned ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the families were able to arm in arms . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
defence Minister from the Le@@ yen called the en@@ cir@@ cled soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and fra@@ c@@ tured .
the chief be@@ headed driver had built the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six @-@ educated tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ents .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ents , which belong to the soldiers , said : &quot; if this crew could not waste the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the administrator of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high significance for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the sm@@ ells were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik is not a grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife after his death . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de village .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen was agree with the decision of her husband , it was further in communication . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried her is un@@ clear .
but he did not teach the intention of being taught in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had made it a H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ ott@@ est ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to be king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired in retirement and also puts the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function that he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being taught in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik , in its almost 50 @-@ year reign , had always had a serious stand . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced about the first years in Denmark : &quot; just a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I prefer wine instead of beer , Sei@@ den@@ str@@ uts instead of stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ in , which I smoke instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the call to be the brand of social intellec@@ tuals , I couldn &apos;t hope for a look . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two bugs ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ election new
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is due to the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to reti@@ re . &quot;
&quot; because he said , on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising end of a Green M@@ EPs from their agricultural activity in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the country code the red @-@ green coalition lost their kn@@ itting a vote in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets formed its step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover . &quot;
CDU Fra@@ ction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ umb@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction to include it .
&quot; therefore , CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new country is voted regular on 14 January .
Th@@ rou@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government had to decide if they could still rule on this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil , however , keeps it indispensable for in@@ comprehen@@ sible that the Parliament decides to quickly decide its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CDU faction will probably decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state of the country also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament will pull the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ u@@ ck@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will answer all questions in peace , when they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ rou@@ ters called the T@@ west@@ ward step &quot; but some cur@@ ri@@ os . &quot;
the political scientist myself stressed : &quot; I am no tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called the ab@@ dic@@ ated MP for the return of their land@@ lord .
&quot; we are of course , of course , that they have received their estate agent that has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , divided the state of met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot;
they deliberately decided not to lead a foreign language in the group .
&quot; even before the background that there was no content differences , we cannot afford this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the leader of the Lower Saxony @-@ members El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ als to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of Social Democrats on Friday on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , rele@@ asing the Land@@ tag quickly . &quot;
the exit T@@ west@@ ens will cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the political scientist , in her last erup@@ tion and in her fru@@ stration their personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ate game and tries to beat the political capital .
the CDU Fra@@ ction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ umb@@ ler wants to recommend his members to include El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets in the CDU .
&quot; the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets , with personal career appro@@ ves the outcome of the 2013 election election . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was the strongest force in the SPD in front of the SPD , SPD and Green in the country , but a very thin majority of a voice . &quot;
&quot; agriculture minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses eggs about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Land@@ lord &apos;s Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in the interview with the Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage everyone in the consumer and to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states provide the most recent information about the affected Eg@@ gs @-@ Char@@ gen . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all the eggs get out of the offer , because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ers of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ? &quot;
food surveillance is the task of the German states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched up and found himself since dis@@ closure of the parties of Germany in the narrow exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has just like the manufacturer to worry , that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and health are un@@ question@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if in eggs of the return level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the local units are to blame .
are manufacturing enterprises and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the label , the production plants does not meet the immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , it must be calculated with economic damage due to mut@@ ually illegal practition@@ ers . &quot;
as always there is too little control in harvest .
is it only missing at the staff or on the slo@@ ppy jurisdiction ?
&quot; it was just the official controls , which have been exposed to the process . &quot;
&quot; for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; just therefore , a consistent information about such events and hand@@ over to the leaders in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be found , of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already noted that I expect a bridge @-@ free information from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; consumer consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and conveniently @-@ ready food . &quot;
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer consumers and consumers are distur@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; by adding funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; generally , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ supply animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately . &quot;
it must consistently be worked with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is c@@ auti@@ ous and in@@ correct . &quot;
how the financial rules of football to Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ interrupted issues of European football will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars Weltre@@ k@@ ord @-@ Transfer from Spain to Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
&quot; any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA nor , as the leading organization that supervised the European game has power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were called in 2011 by the UEFA Cup , means that PS@@ G has to point in some point that the transfer by Ne@@ y@@ mar was financed without large losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ lians from its contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars moved to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with the money to make Ne@@ y@@ mar , and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the funding of the teams by the energy rich mist@@ ice family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must ins@@ ure with legitim@@ ate entry sources , which allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; after his election to the UEFA President , FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their quest to succeed , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in when banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shi@@ fted from concentration to monitoring their losses on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini is fallen by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander will continue to deter them from excessive expend@@ itu@@ res . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future yet , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press in the last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ y@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the det@@ achment for the next five years will be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players who otherwise limited to 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEFA is searching for clubs , who could try to over@@ look their financial care by emplo@@ ying their revenues by companies that are associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ c company could capit@@ ulate the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market growth , the UEFA would not apply as legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA level was captured by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar will come to Qatar about payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar , 2022 , fought that Ne@@ y@@ mar World ambassador will just be able to figure out a such man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEFA Reg@@ ulations . &quot;
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to note the rules .
UEFA had no prepared discussions with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars Transfer , announ@@ cing the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they said under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press since they weren &apos;t able to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars arrival is a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ts . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise at least 30 percent after signing the signing of the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars sign@@ posts by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financed d@@ oping &quot; with the Club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars of the local owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al managers Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservation of La League against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
&quot; over the past few years , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y board has manufactured chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the meeting of cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the contract .
&quot; Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p , on request of the news agency S@@ DA , confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will join a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked all two to three years and under@@ go a quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; approximately 17 million small @-@ white packaged plates are distributed to 14 grams a year prior to landing at passengers . &quot;
the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to make any information about the cost .
industry analysts estimate the order volume according to the North @-@ West Swiss francs - 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly the advertising effect : for a donation manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants are on the new tender , Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y the Swiss . &quot;
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers are coming . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract about the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not reached for a statement . &quot;
&quot; choc@@ ol@@ ates boards , Swiss has been on board their flights since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; before Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut plant in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long h@@ aul flights , customers of the First Class with treats will be spo@@ iled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gl@@ i , in the business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi von Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi von Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , well distributed in Economy Class , is also available on the short route . &quot;

&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ vel ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity forever .
&quot; and there is another crazy guy in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ ste@@ er ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ courses of the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes very much fun to see the old young Mr. Rud@@ d to see the Matt D@@ alli@@ pp@@ enb@@ one of &quot; Singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on camp Andy feels like an old ch@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments random mad@@ ness that might be able to heat this fran@@ chise , like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; will show the band as they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon has been reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West ring campaign I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka &apos;s com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director gives to his : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard lam@@ ent Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ o J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i whose dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt synchron@@ ized in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for the look ( the police gives the time to view chess in television as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous spokes@@ man - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ om Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ thful of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Reagan mask , is included - that it &apos;s often a single one . &quot;
&quot; at six long episodes , it moves away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , which was re@@ dig@@ ged on a lower length , could return the American message , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef has always been able to visit the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who gave a he@@ ap ham@@ burger . &quot;
the embassy for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can do everything for a gel .
&quot; the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger story , and with him . &quot;
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects are searching for the public prosecutor in Constance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he was arrested for 15 years in the age between 25 and 77 , and already issued arrest warran@@ ts for these arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials set up major quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same Raz@@ ents in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Mafia was accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office was established against the organized drug traff@@ icking in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the leaders in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
hence the big deployment on Wednesday morning also accompanied by four officers from Palermo .
&quot; in the vision@@ aries of investigations , Italian nationals combined with regards to Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , in which early morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , should go to the bonds . &quot;
way of g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner regi@@ sters
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear here : &quot; according to a report , the fore@@ igner regi@@ sters shows significant defects in Germany . &quot;
this lead to partly engraved patches for asylum procedures .
&quot; according to the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , the reference management of the Federal Government , wrote a media report on big g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; in the analysis of asylum procedures and deportation orders , the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; could be applied to some of the registered data could be detected at asylum procedures and deportation . &quot;
&quot; according to the register , ten million people are recorded with foreign citizens , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts have not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long have become more alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct datas@@ ets cannot slow down recur@@ ring processes , it means a report on the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of foreign nationals , EU citizens are en@@ cap@@ tive that they would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such mis@@ directives , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with extinction . &quot; thus , it is therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has apparently started to return refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy if they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this emerged from an internal paper of the Federal Minister of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation in the place . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin agreements , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant immig@@ rant to another EU country , this state can send him back to the immig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds write the office now : &quot; meanwhile , admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy have delivered for inclusion and accomodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) is sufficient for sufficient support .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political speech in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatening for lack of defects in the Italian asylum system for human rights and a endanger@@ ing child . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 liters of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons , the blood circulation system has already been available to other people . &quot;
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; at the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , with a total of 100 donations in the meantime , bought 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church in the meeting of the Municipal Council will don@@ ate multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome , as our body is designed for this and we will provide donations that their blood is available for foreigners , nor un@@ profitable , &quot; Mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of the only blood don@@ ors helps several people to explain the collective director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the con@@ serv@@ atives are dismant@@ led into their components . &quot;
&quot; for example , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions that were carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donations . &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house has led to higher participants in a few years ago .
&quot; already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ bre@@ lla were awarded to the multi @-@ professional don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 in each case . &quot;
&quot; half so many , Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Rie@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter was ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of her life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England is holding the interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the growth of inflation would have an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; will remain as they continued the interest rates on family income in the middle of a ampli@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) voted to increase interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with a lower interest rate in this month , since weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank revised its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the household income would continue to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they are sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest threats would be necessary to cur@@ b inflation , and she said that the loan costs might be expected more than expected to rise to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business cycle , which was published before a Bre@@ xit a year ago . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide budget for banks , although it is said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billions of Po@@ unds Sterling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because pressure on the real wages of households continues to reduce consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent would be required than the markets are expected . &quot;
markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the bank , however , stressed that increases &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the Bank forecast for this and next year , compared to the growth forecast in May , 1.9 % and 1.7 % were projected . &quot;
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; after these messages , the Po@@ und fell from the dollar and the euro . &quot;
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; the decision on no change occurs after the most recent dis@@ appointing growth figures increased the rising expectations on a interest rate and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2 % , in the previous three months , increased to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easily re@@ covering after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and low level of sal@@ aries , as the exac@@ erb@@ ation becomes even worse before they repair themselves . &quot;
&quot; it added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot prevent the income statement , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; can be re@@ covering . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds , resulting in a part of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes to a year after reducing interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pace . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy completely .
&quot; prior to the final judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call on a interest rate has increased , since inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ pressing households , with three political decision makers in July resulted in a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected to put it again in the coming months . &quot;
the bank said that its aims at the ratio of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; to be given to the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ ser@@ ene , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage for Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the short return of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again as the credit lines are looking forward to shops and the year in positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those who connect the existing De@@ als and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many are becoming increasingly popular with free @-@ free options and low rates . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV @-@ loss treatment . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ risk reduction in high risk reduction was reduced by around 86 percent , now being delivered by the health service over a first three @-@ year study to estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he was ready to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court in the last year , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; he announced on Thursday , he was greeted by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
&quot; Pre@@ ex@@ positioning sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex , to reduce the risk of HIV infection . &quot;
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection endangered .
&quot; Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means , that just there are enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection . &quot;
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come to the treatment , gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants are identified , identified in the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who are living in England and registered at a resident doctor may also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medicines in this week after an international competition pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study will assess the overall potential of Pr@@ EP by applying clinical evidence , as it is targeted and implemented in large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the extensive and increasingly successful effort for prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when targeted and dangerous people are targeted , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a negoti@@ ating with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to be aware that the study is run fast throughout the country and that no one who has left an risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
&quot; evidence shows how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection can end . &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to comprehen@@ sion of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of the distribution of HIV in society . &quot;
living large lives : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment to a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has un@@ packed their pockets .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; I showed me this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I made me love in love and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet were completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a dirty layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage room and an mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose she instructed the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together , without leaving us to g@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about to build a simple platform , but the steel that it had the right height or below the right height . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan , to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine you can see a classic copper light from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ orous area .
&quot; gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays a role in adding theatres , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
&quot; so , the special thing is that it is about a garage door . &quot;
&quot; a little engineering art went into &quot; , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite to it , so if you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne offers additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to increase the floor area and use high @-@ quality materials , which make room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and are therefore helping to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and elevated square met@@ ering of some standard@@ oc@@ re in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar capital empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after her Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and business activities should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion on the separation will take place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , then the family purchased a business in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood family since 1973 . &quot;
there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
&quot; in 1999 , it was sold to 85 million US dollars . &quot;
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centers in the subur@@ ban . &quot;
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father Colin - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is described - about two @-@ thirds of the company assets and Paul about one third .
&quot; a judicial authorities say that Colin is owned by a value of $ 316 million , and Paul owns a value of 176 million dollars . &quot;
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a promot@@ er point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the emergence of Colin proposed to leave him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in the first Mon@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday last Friday . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control over the existing shop - what Colin , as Paul claimed to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ed that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , to manage some owners . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he was hoping to join the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firm . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ ac@@ ies from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early 1970s , a shop in Bruns@@ wick bought . &quot;
&quot; they used safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ k family . &quot;
Colin says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years the High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to give their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi told me that he never wanted to land his brothers &quot; brothers , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is company group , but Colin claimed that Mark at leaving the company paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke also said , &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation bitter@@ ness . &quot;
Colin made himself very back although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television .
Fair@@ fax Media took his contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin made by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; because the case is before the dishes . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to acc@@ use our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not wish that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he was still looking for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an equivalent course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , participated in his first working day with conducting employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he would repair : bad information taken into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the employees that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media processor . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed due to a fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign agents could do something that we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets have not included more ignition with their interventions .
&quot; probably , we will never experience something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump is not sent . &quot;
&quot; when his staff had made it a few times , trouble from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently been able to prevent dr@@ ump contro@@ versy . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem exists in the fact that people in a white house , which are competing in a white house , are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material , possibly promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of counsel@@ ors , president of strategic reasons doub@@ tful information . &quot;
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press pieces , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he might find out what they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February when somebody called the President b@@ ös@@ sing a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , who accused the Deputy Stab@@ ili@@ ated K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of his le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been ban@@ ished to Twitter permanently from Twitter , or that he has no specific evidence , or that he expressed mis@@ vo@@ ws in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ maker added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still stri@@ ving to influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make wa@@ ys mission very difficult .
bug@@ ging bur@@ gl@@ ers get Post of Europ@@ ol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all Europe sends postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought bur@@ gl@@ ers are not known in nature , hints of the population will be hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Europ@@ ol reported on Friday of the promotion , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences have shown that many volatile and holiday dest@@ iny hide , it was called Europ@@ ol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ o , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online news could have been arrested , at least eleven of them based on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the Million@@ aire Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some un@@ locked travelers on the foot of war which have drawn up by the church in order to rec@@ la@@ ve a field before their Manor houses .
&quot; the passengers have their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire Series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies , and a army of transport of transport after they had been kicked out only in May , without being deported from one from the Council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their cases . &quot;
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained un@@ han@@ dicapped to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious inhabit@@ ant have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent away from Bentley Heath where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers .
&quot; the Council must be forced through shame on the implementation , as dealing with the problem was us@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; the trav@@ ellers were there in May , and have been moved again . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to get started by keeping long sub@@ mitt@@ ances in order to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my common tax when the Council can &apos;t stop once .
&quot; a resident that would not be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of these traveler only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the figures have increased this time and even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; the Council of Soli@@ hull said , &quot; We are aware of an in@@ fu@@ eled camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps , so as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence , it is very important that as far as many residents in the police report an anti @-@ social or criminal law in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must test , when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes .
the house outside the Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to re@@ open on 1 March next year .
they are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ence of business company mbH to 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights have lost a year and also proceeds from the local fee . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in the fall of 2014 , the numbers of refugees that came to the administrative district , offered the property building with the country &apos;s estate , which was provided for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up an development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
&quot; however , most of the Freu@@ den@@ meister Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four homes with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Mann@@ al@@ b .
&quot; Lu@@ ise Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes obvious that extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with big sho@@ wering showers , the input area will be transformed , new window will be installed . &quot;
&quot; all should be &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; like Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a je@@ wel . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher downtown level , pointed out . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms would be spreading , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to be precise . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , is open to a courtyard . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Jury Rec@@ ei@@ ves Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair by U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , a special report Robert Mu@@ eller is intended to have called a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Board recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the job . &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; the CNN broad@@ casts , it is already the first loading of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use Kre@@ m@@ lin since long , targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 . &quot;
he studied mu@@ eller if they were talking about Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , there are several men standing in the election campaign as a member of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Com@@ miss@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally looked into the centre and find the accus@@ ation , whether the President may imp@@ lo@@ red the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to examine and decide the evidence in possible frag@@ ile cases , and to decide whether the charges shall be charged . &quot;
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore referred to as a count of indictment .
&quot; they are mostly enabled , when it is larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process is always closed behind closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to the hearing under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the broad@@ caster CNN , demonstrations have already been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting , were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and s@@ eg@@ ers@@ ohn J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ er election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were with the conversation . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday night in US television that the illustration show that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not be promised that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the accus@@ ation of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia in order to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they don &apos;t have anything else to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his Special Advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he knows nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , this work is usually in obe@@ dience , emphas@@ ized . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ate any measures that accelerated the work of the special report on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that I won &apos;t be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was further explained in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ ut@@ ations , accus@@ ations made up against dr@@ ump had become lou@@ dly , he tried to hin@@ der justice . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the President is under pressure under pressure .
&quot; according to representation of US media , the White House has collected material against the Special Representative and its employees . &quot;
that dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent Special Congress of Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair in order to return later to President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller could be fired at the presidency of the President of the President of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators issued two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators on Thursday , after which the Special Representative could no longer be released . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg is driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin was lo@@ osed from Sch@@ el@@ eventh . &quot;
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the spread over a trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 @-@ kilometer large colon@@ oss are now going to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice @-@ makers who have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent of climate change has played a role in the crash of the ice has been un@@ clear according to research .
&quot; however , since about 30 years a series of unusual mer@@ ges in the region , the U.S. Research Center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fac@@ tor@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , the exploration can be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scarf .
Sch@@ el@@ eventh swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aciers .
&quot; therefore , it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrated is located south of South America almost at the head of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was distur@@ bed the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt@@ ing some years ago .
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ eventh celebrations to fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is quite a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eventh time is in danger , because the front edge had never been withdrawn as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice plate is under tension and can be destroyed , if a piece of keys can be cut off . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ eventh and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , since they swim in the water and p@@ ushes the ice so much water , as it gives it to the melt itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of serp@@ ent@@ s@@ ises indicates that the gl@@ aciers are directly into the sea , and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in low measurements , the British research project writes about the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ C , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrated is the fourth biggest sh@@ el@@ eventh time of Antar@@ c@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the start of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eventh time will be back again , and possibly return to the long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models will say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers have not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg to change climate change , so in the past few decades a lot of ice r@@ inkl@@ es were destroyed during the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends toward South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature rise contributed to decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have passed over 50 years in the past 50 years , and t@@ aming the areas in which the temperature is fastest growing . &quot;
CDU wants to shelter at the personnel
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult to occupy freely @-@ ending positions , the CDU calls on the employer to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , there has been 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind . &quot;
the teaching positions in the circle are clearly cov@@ eted .
some 620 applications were expected to be recorded in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing to overcome the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , there are 50 non @-@ occupied positions at the district M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are searched for the general administration . &quot;
the CDU wants to take part in the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG in the administration .
&quot; according to the wish of parties , the management aims to work as a concept for personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term constra@@ ints to professionals , but future @-@ orient@@ ates of the applicant &apos;s short@@ age , it is called . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ starting points and include an apprenticeship offensive , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this has been listening to a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , which one had not known earlier . &quot;
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the address is from a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ condition@@ ers from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , for example , to act the highest time , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , leader of the CDU , goes out with his party to the common application . &quot;
&quot; he was already sor@@ row@@ ful in the chal@@ k for a fine @-@ thick surprise when he publicly presented the personnel cost , and the other parties bl@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; people want to be reviewed , that all possibilities will be checked to enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers . &quot;
&quot; if we are not able to achieve a satisfactory solution here , the district administration with the unions - maybe also in cooperation with the affiliated towns - a pet tariff , should aim at that point . &quot;
&quot; in order to pay the CDU , the employees and the officials to pay better than it considers the tariff for opening service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently applicable , Incre@@ ases or more money is only if you changes in a higher level that orient@@ ates itself to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle has increased increasingly in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute @-@ Protection Act . &quot;
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO mig@@ rant rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs who are in the Mediterranean boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue their new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not under@@ take a new code of conduct , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can continue &quot; , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; because their team had worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express itself detailed presentation of the Italian government of Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so , we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only assess all the accus@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; , supervised the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that its crew takes place on board over@@ board migrants who can be delivered directly from men &apos;s hands , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposedly found only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosecutor &apos;s office whose contents was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of going on the authority of Italian Coast Guard , the lif@@ esp@@ an in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not taken out of any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officers , supervised their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue sets have so far been ready to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , since they would not have no significant changes or disabilities . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti , meanwhile , said that the number of migrants who came in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy , had strongly declined in recent weeks , reflecting the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guards and collaboration with the local Citi@@ zen fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan Citi@@ zens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali through measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
ascension and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin outdoor post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the northern Palat@@ inate , for four days tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and win@@ nings of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome Extra .
the first tour carried on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ ic@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; they followed viewing points , partly on towers , of which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were again longer ascent , for the long tri@@ b@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest . &quot;
&quot; again , look@@ out point to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate growth . &quot;
&quot; over the last two days , many altitude meters were reported . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and ruins brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers gathered in the open @-@ off content of healing Sole .
Neustadt has also been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural - met . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga cle@@ ars for e @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in future of computer consoles instead of fighting through wind and weather on the stadium sha@@ kes ?
&quot; fact : E @-@ Sports has long been to become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high quality . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal state , which is increasingly committed in this area . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department , and two professionals took a contract for the computer game of FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to am@@ aze all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is certain that there are still some clubs on this train .
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; which shows the gam@@ ers of various clubs . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds , that the young people also go into the stadium , says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : clubs tried , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ ers under the contract , you could be present online far more frequently on these markets as only once in year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA @-@ Simulation FIFA will be released on competition . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
and with Asia &apos;s 2022 e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but are you ever a real sports type ?
&quot; for many , the idea is safe to use . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ m has also dealt with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport , because it &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions show that you can also find in classical sport - for example increased cardi@@ ac frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult at online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classic Sports . &quot;
the scientist raises the high integral effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts . &quot;
a study by the corporate consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( B@@ IS ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales of 130 million is expected . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football division , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey . &quot;
&quot; internationally , many countries are already on . &quot;
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher is inv@@ ests in the e@@ sports competitions Uni@@ ver@@ n .
&quot; even in Europe , some things are doing . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport had been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ m . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first @-@ league associations in France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in European comparison , Germany left behind , &quot; V@@ f@@ B Executive Board , R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot;
&quot; only to fall in nostal@@ gia , and clari@@ fy the old times , is not enough anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore to preserve the tradition of the Society , but the company will be setting up the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in an digit@@ alized world , &quot; also D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t hold it on it , that only at football everything remains , as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter due to the lyrics , the Conrad Roy to commit suicide , condemned &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by lyrics and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced to life in June , because of the death of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ adulter@@ ated .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
&quot; she had been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she had joined Mr Roy in a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured fl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ al@@ igned eyes when they were condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions were killed in Conrad Roy , &quot; said the lawyer &apos;s lawyer . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ney lawyer said , &quot; &quot; it was a horri@@ ble circum@@ stance she had to be regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , that he did not find that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess &quot; or even her spiritual sickness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is no day that I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will bear with us for eternity , for his sisters , it is in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be prosec@@ uted by the realization &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or his aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more this only person , with whom I was together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life forever , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legally preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts who makes it a crime to commit suicide , committed suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead by a carbon mono@@ xide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the event attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters Text@@ statements revealed that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging up , spring from a building , walk yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent to his death in two weeks before his death . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes look ahead of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn off the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has dealt the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few people defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder in her British co @-@ resident in Italy before being acquitted of two years ago . &quot;
&quot; woman Knox , 30 years old , published a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;

Joshua K@@ imm@@ i allowed the Audi Cup as a captain at the Audi Cup .

&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , that was Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even when the additional clothing was very small , very small . &quot;

&quot; add sugar to those who want to pay a lot to those who want to hold a lot . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to compete the lame of L@@ ame , a small extra @-@ motivation can only be used . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to go as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , 22 @-@ year @-@ old serves as a mini @-@ lame on the field . &quot;
&quot; on the right side , this is now its position , the white bin@@ ds on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ i even worked in this starting report as the one that can take the ru@@ dder into the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , attempted to turn the un@@ divided tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal thus , to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ks barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , get out of the performance of the Asia trip ( fol@@ ks only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le so that in their first appearance at the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t cannot drop negative . &quot;

&quot; in addition to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y was running out of the defense , both agile . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and the sw@@ inging also tried a few times in the game building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y said to the fact that the result was not so , as we would have hop@@ ed for . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance in the debut .

companies satisfied with Rhineland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic ministers : Wirtschaft pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
&quot; often in@@ con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new econom@@ ist Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk about T @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ ad@@ ling at the same time the old Minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke is blocked . &quot;
&quot; the biggest swe@@ eping system sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policies : the connection of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the priority list of the country now at the top . &quot;
&quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 the building should be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank Trier , which is located in the pre @-@ int@@ ru@@ sive needs of the Federal Rail@@ road schedule . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but international competing companies . &quot;
&quot; in Trier , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) inspired Trier as a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , knowledge have an open ear for people who want to establish its own company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; in Trier , the Chamber of Trier is looking for an additional inc@@ entive for young apprentices , Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; fore@@ seen is a premium of 1,000 euros for the educational examination and 2500 euros , when graduates within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road construction a quick facts can be made , at the same time , there is the necessary staff , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the chief executive leader of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , knowing the knowledge of mobility , so far 29 places are occupied so far . &quot;
the BC@@ CI calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; CDU faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the calculations of the invoice , the country of investing in 2017 and 2018 , more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads as proposed . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Frank Nat@@ us , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to fix the lack of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
sober@@ ing is further the previous full range of broadband in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had assessed the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they focus on mol@@ ding internet connections and out@@ breaks .

&quot; Audi is expected to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face counter@@ action with counter@@ action . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi told BMW , that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ Chair@@ woman said that &quot; there is more intelligent options as a road constra@@ int , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles , or to restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it was modified three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des which em@@ it diesel engines apply as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , plants for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles explo@@ ded exhaust gases , also take what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the company try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called auto @-@ devices that have been tested to keep the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be judged in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused of having installed a system to deal with the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the involvement of Audi in the study could heavy heavy loads , the luxury car manufacturer is a proportional to gain of Volkswagen by Volkswagen . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons character , the buttons of its figures are its trademark . &quot;
&quot; in addition , 85 records the Argentin@@ ean one and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 in Buenos Aires as the son of Spanish immigrants .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he joined himself as a sig@@ net for happiness cards - which was fru@@ str@@ ated by him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded him breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
&quot; again , the artists of cities were inspired again . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures are painted in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he sits his own data , still on sket@@ ches , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;

lavender from Provence of climate change threat@@ ens
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lavender is decl@@ ining because of the inf@@ ancy in drought conditions and because of the diseases of transferred insects , scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert on the farm research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the spring of the last few years and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden we@@ ars , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
&quot; lavender oil not only attracts for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; solutions that are considered into consideration , include a better water distribution and slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spread of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist under@@ lines growing threat to Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce will usually meet in Wed@@ nes@@ days to check out their plans for reporting over the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by which organized crimes against civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
&quot; but this day , in the shade of its own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children in the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the space : opponent , Neut@@ ral , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the reporter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; there are drug ding@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the beh@@ est list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there are no rest from the violence , and during the whole country the bodies are common , more journalists are always employed : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto have reached his office in December 2012 . there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her publisher and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is experienced deep , even though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wearing T @-@ shirts , who will be able to show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panam@@ anian . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a German Federal Office was built in 2010 to process journalists from journalists , these were only two criminal proceedings under the committee to protect journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders , which are associated with drug traff@@ icking and organis@@ ational crimes each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rare in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are in@@ comfor@@ ting , even though the Ter@@ rain is still til@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the killer , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid , to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we know not the Why , we miss all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper , who is translated into the &quot; 12th river . &quot; &quot;
the shooter rode away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but there is practically nothing on the topic of Val@@ dez .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans has been arrested for the last year and extradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country as ri@@ val@@ ing fac@@ tions here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road , or that the cemetery is full of injured , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug people who are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget it for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
&quot; initially , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ ing ant@@ it@@ ational fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , susp@@ ects gear members bought each copy of the output , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper that had the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long to take his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined together with five colleagues at the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars involved .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without paying attention to the rob@@ ber@@ ote problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters loved it , hard tre@@ ff@@ ing investigations without fear to publish c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else had to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for protection of journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where ever she led them . &quot;
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in October last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you need to take the task that you get as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done for so many more . why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse , the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and ratings , a teacher , who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always walk to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask : was his love for routine , being a routine ? &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own lawyers in question , how they do best do and live in the life . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you have their wives , their children , their little shops , their home run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move on drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ aging and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ ct .
&quot; when it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , not just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; suddenly , no mobile phones met at Ri@@ odo@@ ce for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
&quot; they were commissioned by the state government , to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central @-@ class area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in the joke , some of the reporter asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who were the governor even as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountains , where the drug fighters are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce laid on three main layers . &quot;
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , which focused on the home town of the Governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about it , who has been kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politics , which ruled the reg@@ ent Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high kar@@ aoke cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter , to write about previous events in this local restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went down to a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ icker , dedicated to the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; reporter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez made a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning , because of another journalist at the Office of the Prosecutor . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists had become stronger , by organizing protests in organised protests &quot; SOS Press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pron@@ ounce journalists and to kill them , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has since then asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is worried that their anger has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists were surrounded by the organis@@ ational crimes , involved government officials and an equi@@ val@@ ed society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters not only have to be killed by drugs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Media Group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because she would like to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern boundary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
&quot; in addition to their separate head , computer keyboard and headphones . &quot;
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua according to the assassination of the Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach .
&quot; others continue , as it did El man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 . &quot;
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly established the drug box with a Editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , like the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , gives that the drug traff@@ icking is troubled . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting on the premises in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ med up . &quot;
a number of shooting paintings with band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 deaths .
the war ri@@ pped on how it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the Bord@@ st@@ les , they have news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ els near - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards stopped to see if they were in read@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the legendary founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff followed by Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think of it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practition@@ ers asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to devi@@ ate his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even determine that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was from a red@@ dish brown - and they said she could have had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; called it as &quot; the extinction of the din@@ osau@@ rs , which has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbelie@@ v@@ ably good condition , researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable , &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Funk , when he joined Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met on something which seemed out of the surrounding rocks at the square , and decided to be more precise . &quot;
the F@@ ossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main writer Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creation is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , resem@@ bles a wand@@ ing tanks , probably threatened by meat car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ge@@ ared din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ory , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technology that is known as a counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing that is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , made headlines in May , and is now able to see the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology in May . &quot;
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours in order to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of she@@ ds and arm@@ aments over his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ sha@@ dy , an widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature dar@@ ker was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the consistency is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution has improved the con@@ frontation with the con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the con@@ ter@@ ti@@ ers - think of Re@@ he , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ mo@@ vers - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than lo@@ ot , what signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strong ge@@ ared din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales are also showing that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r @-@ brown was red .
&quot; scientists will continue to study the animal on notes about his life , including his con@@ ser@@ tation , to figure out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and pushed into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as South @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ genital skin , but also in three dimensions and maintain the original form of the animal , Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost identical , like in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous was a time , as huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth moved through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists who appear in the journal current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was lost after the death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the creation was found by Shawn Funk , when he finished in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ e@@ aters f@@ lowed through the western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the ag@@ itation of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the remaining remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the Hau@@ tre@@ ad still cover b@@ ump@@ kin plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is as rare as a profit in the l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; rocky remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right front foot is situated on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the she@@ ds at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : massage amb@@ amb@@ ol@@ age to A8 : many injured
great accident on Thursday night at the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ ers@@ - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , a mass of 20 people have been injured during the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first figures of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Landkreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a weather was almost 30 vehicles , probably lor@@ ries , together with trucks . &quot;
&quot; above the exact number of injured persons , no data should be seen . &quot;
&quot; it was a slight to medium @-@ serious injuries , said a police pre@@ ference . &quot;
a large impact on rescue vehicles was on the accident site .
the A8 was completely locked towards Munich .
&quot; in Munich , a approximately ten kilometer long back@@ drop was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ reporter reported , there came also on the opposite train to massive Dis@@ abilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ fighters not@@ ched the label of the vehicle tools , which now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; just after 18 : 45 hours , another accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is going on the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes up an uns@@ an@@ ft or breaks the ride in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently testing the free ticket inspection .
&quot; they just have been confirmed by mobile phone , that you have taken his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
currently there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; if the offer is , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; next year , it is expected to be available on many more remote routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a subway . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the road ticket application without any officer .
&quot; to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what to do in most passengers already .
&quot; you also have to buy the DB Navigator app , which is the most comfortable type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last one needs a seat space .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works in the train , the ticket calls on &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , button on electronic de@@ valuation will be released . &quot;
&quot; the train leaders get a message on their mobile devices , that the driver X is in the train and has taken place for the booked seat . &quot;
&quot; the train head of the ticket inspection at Square Y knows that there is a passenger with already @-@ free online ticket , too . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , keep on , keep on . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which again is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who would like to travel without ticket inspection by our train drivers , check in the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB Remote traffic . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs .
&quot; who often goes train , knows that besides del@@ ays and pas@@ ches , the ticket controls are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , however , one of the recru@@ iting not all documents that you need to use online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or personal identity card or any document you need to prove .
&quot; the result are endless discussions between train leaders and rides , which leads to poor senti@@ ment in the part or large room and del@@ ays at the end of their own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
&quot; and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen . &quot;
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how was a activist to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to their core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after being arrived in New York City , St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ roll@@ ed by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a Post of somebody from the High School .
&quot; the police has just put an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah has been constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of bro@@ wns @-@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the road and stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot;
but death was for her and her community nothing new .
&quot; she laid their mobile phone , in order to become a Twe@@ et on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive on the evening . &quot;
&quot; there were photos of police band and people , the crying out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood by demonstr@@ ators with a rebelli@@ ous dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman told his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , saying , &quot; I will all kill you ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and that we can be typical . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I felt cont@@ ills . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in community and the streets to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two have a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight , what they believe ? &quot; remin@@ ded her what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past .
&quot; it has to know , and it will see and on it . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organization , but also known to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the lucky fortune to give her an experience in which they personally experienced no ek@@ y rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black female child . &quot;
&quot; I feel the feeling I would have a poor service to keep it away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was at a camp@@ ground when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business partner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped them to pass on protest@@ ers .
slowly started a new type of acti@@ vism for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; after 9 August , my acti@@ vism changed completely , &quot; &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ se Association and concentrated on food justice and health qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar , just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
one question was Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ?
&quot; this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often by white - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices were not cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differently .
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct occup@@ ants . &quot;
his commitment brought the project closer together with six other loc@@ als the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns &apos;s shooting .
this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be depicted . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on he@@ rel@@ ing experience - to show that it is not a &quot; &quot; Messiah &quot; &quot; movement , but in order to come together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participants of the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ el &apos;s life as she loves and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be certain injuries in this work , and for the human @-@ purpose of black people . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Fer@@ rel@@ le &apos;s history repeatedly repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the bro@@ ader Black Li@@ ves Movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have min@@ ted the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the social media after the killing of the black te@@ ens in 2012 , identified as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in all , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling at various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice , that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was chosen because of their identity as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front front , because with a life on these cru@@ ises than a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy by the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to remain . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is placed on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social and social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos .
&quot; yet she kl@@ es herself to a singing and she feels obliged to remember this memory , since she walked three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size mad &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss a bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ Gallery moves the people , although it is not built for long . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre in the south of the pedestrian street has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation of 2009 in supporters and opponents .
&quot; cold , the theme is hardly any one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while they say , &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be real class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi ) or simply : &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery has more customers in the city , including all other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmers market stands , in which 13 direct market shares offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction , construction will be completed . &quot;
the gallery cre@@ ators want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle in the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farmer market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of Land@@ wives always happy again . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher for us .
&quot; we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery , a chance is to maintain this offer . &quot;
&quot; in other cities , there is also that . &quot;
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eters in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; this is likely to be low in the new project , but not even low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why are buying items in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dro@@ pl@@ ings or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many cargo shops are empty - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but here , however , there is not once a regular weekly market , it is the more important that we have received at least the Mark@@ thalle . &quot;
&quot; because all the goods offered there is freshly prepared , most of them are offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ ously cheap . &quot;
&quot; as you see , shop stores in a shopping mall only rented out of larger companies , because the dor@@ m are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special business@@ s exist almost no more and what is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market rise during the construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration , when the Bit Gallery is actually coming . &quot;
or is it already creating the g@@ hosts bit gallery beforehand to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just doesn &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; after my view , it would have been better to promote a real estate market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmer market hall there is no more space thanks to what I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; when the farmers market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which depend on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair pieces made by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ tics had been a 35 @-@ year sentence , after they publicly made diplomatic reports about the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer science , and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman , and left dis@@ sidents , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama as he only had three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing , such as someone could look like with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , such as someone may be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has already been talking about the identification as a woman , was convicted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ ying act , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; due to the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photograph - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is deliberately sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and has been associated with a plat@@ in@@ blonde . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just coming from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in this way , the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ ical Ar@@ te@@ facts such as cig@@ ars and che@@ wing gum produced by removing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were too un@@ equal letters that exchanged several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; she even created an exhibition of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which would predicted a future in which the President Chel@@ ens would consider and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings had been released for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of happy gathering . &quot;
&quot; there is also a little depth and Star@@ ke at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eters , which he actually should fix it further . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a wall of the gallery &apos;s artistic statement , Mann@@ ing urged with its superior signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) an end of the &quot; automatic shred@@ der , their foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , her mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence is written - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide , according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work is from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a private room , is a page from the above mentioned comic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as she is faced with a Freis@@ ener Ho@@ ef@@ on in hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States , like King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , they won it , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never just the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition in person - just as it was going to do in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of space of masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which summar@@ ises themselves as hor@@ des of protest@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this was also aimed at targeted as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , which had been written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; nationwide human @-@ hunt has been underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which have been chosen as susp@@ ects , after a man had sto@@ cked in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as well as the acquisition of Cook County &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several sticks passed away . &quot;
a warning warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries in his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective exam@@ ines the stit@@ ches as murder while police actively searching for the two susp@@ ects said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now in ass@@ ess@@ ary and exp@@ elled from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates at this study , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
&quot; War@@ ren is Senior Treasury , at the University of Oxford . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the university and the Ur@@ ville College , in an e @-@ mail statement , said that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are prepared to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities to help each other way . &quot;
&quot; the statement , added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set himself up . &quot;
&quot; in Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , Chief Communications Officer , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of her residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip , said the said that in apartment 10@@ 08 anything was happening . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident happened on July 27 , too . &quot;
security cameras was confirmed that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for recovery of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fill@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA program to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ en@@ forcement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could cause something for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results from the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state @-@ sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we conduct the investigation , because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has collapsed an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programmes , and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales site R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA by D@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in Moscow , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved to the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs anymore

&quot; from now on , only eggs are shipped to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative for fi@@ ref@@ using anti @-@ domestic appliances . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
the Start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; Amy deliver@@ er wanted to measure your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said salvation , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed . &quot;
she called people from outside to help .
&quot; a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies , to figure out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; through the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to support surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; salvation said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feeling at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap @-@ surveys and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a high heat card of the company that shows most complaints , which have most complaints and which managers have low access results - so that you can drill , why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that at the fore@@ front of the workplace culture we have to stay , so that a former employee has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als , which has been a former employee of a blog post , who talked about those who have spoken is punished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
&quot; global Governance , Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and to recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ cre@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convert almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t Company lets you send a customized &quot; pulse &quot; p@@ olls , confi@@ dential answers to real time and view the warmth in your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that can notify people of bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main managing director is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the judgment of the public opinion has been recorded by the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff are badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers of fluctu@@ ating and complaints , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ t has used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; previously , if a person wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the problems of employees . &quot;
&quot; now since the company Conver@@ cent set up , problems may be hidden in offices in cities or states that were hidden in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or un@@ noisy practices . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in legal dispute . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen had collapsed because of the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty linen online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and ass@@ els the company with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , where the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given by the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex in research , showing that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assign@@ ments . &quot;
employees like to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then , Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , has used both Conver@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors gain R@@ end@@ ites if its portfolio business run well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the Analytics tools can promise third parties , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance . &quot;
the data about employee commitment to experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is us@@ eless if the company &apos;s ste@@ ward take no measures . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that a change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees can motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company that they rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow staff , &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who passes the monthly employee surveys now , was able to conduct measures on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , to deliver . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting the feedback from the fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was capable of organizing several teams within the company and to add a communication training within the company and to add a communication training . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights over the employees , and it hopes that for a long point of view , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you will lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose your company . &quot;
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it works on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint player on one side of the new teams of the team are talking on campus .
some have moved their tribute parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this unlimited minutes a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 pm .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real t@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the fully packed time@@ outs of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise between the two days is more than a day , where the brood in the start of the camp moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the formal game preparations for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; MOR@@ A said that he supports the regul@@ ating change of N@@ CAA support , even if they have added a further point in the multiple routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous load three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply run them , they are plac@@ em@@ aking , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practition@@ er as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear families of its fields from a adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already become a protection line behind a go@@ p@@ fo@@ sten , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spati@@ ally learned that there could be a problem , as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far from thinking that people can rent there a room and then set aside , to draw an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry about too big .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with counterfeit detection of third parties and their results below the original contribution then , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize the possible detection of detection and to display them at the fact verification from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was crit@@ ici@@ zed as one of the principal points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they also have influenced the 2016 presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political theme in Europe , with the French voters over@@ flooded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan to eliminate the social media networks unless they succeed , h@@ ass@@ orted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German , that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of new facts will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fact , third parties want to be challenged , people want more context to make profound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and worked for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s a si@@ p@@ hole . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his hom@@ ely seat in the Be@@ wl River valley in K@@ ent and now has become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des who is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly thought emot@@ ionally . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acts on the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double room in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
&quot; and letters always smell as smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as it would be even thereby . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who are beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have seen my welcome drink a little over@@ rated &quot; ) everything seems to be true to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days that the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives , and to study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ted hy@@ mn heads to the walls and bottles that have spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigrated to the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ sc@@ oring , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was first given the full access when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rates said &quot; Oh , put it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English emp@@ ires , maps , which represent what possessed : &quot; one could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a starting point to draw on a wider basis into the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm house of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot which appeared in the castle 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant rose in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which is the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ern@@ ers , the family of Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell presented his own funeral by cutting a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was dug out later ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; men seemed to be quite a gate , ever again debts and money for things they could not afford . &quot;

campaign launched : over 300 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ans@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf .
&quot; with the wra@@ pping of the 301 year old Mari@@ ans@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; still until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team aims to keep the logo and its slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it should be the climax of the campaign a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; the makers of the Aktion since yesterday is on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think of course ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their un@@ locked website yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action there is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a omni@@ directional promise , one that gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f allows its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year in early August advis@@ es the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on retirement and convey@@ ors in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was not held in the General Staff building , as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Government , the President of the Government now also participated in the five Viz@@ ep@@ ites as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
thus the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ number .
the government moved to the military in the military .
&quot; General Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 of 326 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ co . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan of the p@@ utsch . &quot;
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people , who should have been involved directly at the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day following the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the crash test as &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; because he would give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is really in the handle ?
&quot; in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ cover in the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are occup@@ ations due to an increasing &quot; Islamic &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head ban for solo@@ ists , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the major clean@@ se on the army and the security forces goes on .
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent a further 73@@ 95 state operator , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als are earlier than the actual masters of the country .
th@@ rice p@@ utsch@@ es her role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state organisation .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan won the power of the military step by step , not least by calling to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is managing targeted by an Islamic military forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who searched after the coup attempt of fear of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is true , NATO could not get cold out of NATO . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is a doubt in the Alliance after cleansing the Turkish army . &quot;
NATO structures and oper@@ ation@@ alist abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks ahead of reducing the legitim@@ ate immigrants to 50,000 per year , stri@@ cter rules for the issu@@ ing of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and will save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the United States , as well as the citizens from other countries , Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent chains on migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to help themselves and demonstrate knowledge that come to our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to gentle track for race driving
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the racing cre@@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought - now it should go fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the tourist route is scheduled to be built on the tourist line . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the race transport in the long @-@ term , according to the public Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au race route , the country is particularly important for the tourism important connection , &quot; explained traffic Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of the maintenance was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country is 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be matched , S@@ üh@@ l explained . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Railway Rail as an operator were already familiar with technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the used vehicles and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that this race shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the racing shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
&quot; during the past few months , during the course of a pilot project , the track was used by sufficient many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the route is also very high in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 can &apos;t even be a cra@@ zier , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny about it , but the company provide a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners to robots , with a silicone ret@@ ina , which feels warm , with aware of human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust its robots according to its belie@@ fs &quot; &quot; and select everything , from the eye @-@ colour of the robot via the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of its finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it will still worry , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would like to make a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots using a silicone ret@@ ina .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling , such as ti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s the &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre@@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of in@@ timi@@ dated and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous personality . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she may like what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she has also heard their voting rights - as real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many be@@ ati@@ fying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ jection of female relations , though you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : opposed ) Far@@ rah , dis@@ rup@@ tive one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with an vibration but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men no Ro@@ xx@@ xy have ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement point to a little dar@@ ker and deep breath in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes , to a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as optional adding . &quot;
&quot; most men of course do not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices its rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is le@@ ak@@ ened out of the Rand@@ om zones , can be found in regards to the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational . &quot;
and many people are not strange or irrit@@ ated until they are the free market for this permission .
&quot; there is a certain conc@@ ision that these high @-@ developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a pre@@ sidents in the White House , who spoke to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Woman &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the worn body and an out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots exists to create physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their peas , they want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , at the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots are no real women . &quot;
they can &apos;t take away from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; you don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing that could distur@@ b anything on independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of total failure . &quot;
otherwise stated : they are counterfeit slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mp@@ se of 2017 : maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human lives
&quot; it has become a binary form of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions , which have polarized the U.S. voters , have also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Harvest Festival , there was newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ relatives . &quot;
&quot; we meet all , supposedly in order to burst our filter bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ oriented poet that lives in Chicago , and has long visited the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they remembered that the unity could have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to see the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left hand was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the basic effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gra@@ ce@@ ful opportunity to get off his kit@@ ten of a day no longer . &quot;
&quot; however , there are still a frigh@@ tened long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which appear at once in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of dec@@ eit@@ fulness . &quot;
&quot; I can now find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the decline , the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked out ) - which was both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact one as very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans may only be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an unbe@@ ar@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ushing and the animals are turning to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ per@@ ing music convey@@ s this in strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many cl@@ ut@@ ees of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are being familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not be just a dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not all over the day , when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park Car@@ us@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and have all had a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the Car@@ us@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked them after luck . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to assess my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option , the rating with a 15 % tip in the same - this to buy something about the cargo table . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be an neutral exchange , but also ex@@ its pressure on the servers to bring personality into a situation in which no need is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zed , while I tired the experience , you get my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us shi@@ fted with breast pain in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after a appeal by public lawyers against a first death penalty .
&quot; he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s early morning , in keeping it several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der who was hiding in the cabin .
&quot; the secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they were too excited . &quot;
the national prosecution authority said that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objec@@ tion could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs at risk that his sentence has been increased to 15 years if public lawyers are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ stroke champ@@ ions were released from feeding and nurs@@ eries in the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
three of the students will be going to school in the school and four on the secondary school .
school@@ master Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental &apos;s House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; as a symbol for school release , the 29 students of four classes elected under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ les that grows in the chicken yard , but then divor@@ ced in freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chickens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope to make a chicken , destroyed , the eag@@ les spread on a high mountain its wings and escaped . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the classes showed three and four in the students of Y@@ vonne Frank . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , that contributed to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eag@@ les stand for the integration , &quot; Teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte said . &quot;
&quot; the young is different though the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to this . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his provision is to be free .
they wish everyone in the fourth album that he felt in his new school .
&quot; it followed by acceptance of the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who will always jump again at Ped@@ agog@@ ues , and the parents represented . &quot;
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit has now passed away to the class@@ teacher Sophia Schumacher .
&quot; they leave their pupils after two years of lessons , only very un@@ skilled , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ stroke holes . &quot;
&quot; for completion , all students had a song from summer time and holiday time . &quot;
it broke great joy in the kids .
eight first@@ fruits have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians , arrested for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ itim@@ ate people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians had been released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have lost control of the free camp and place each one that is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not for this purpose . &quot;

the ministry said that the Court may be fin@@ ed a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people do to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the main questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; the diesel summit will have BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; they are to improve the exhaust emissions of cars from the Euro 5 emission standard , and in part Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the handmade software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates will only apply to the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the power station Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; manufacturers have announced an adequate implementation in the next few months , but still no exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write every person .
&quot; if it is due to an inspection , this is done in their context . &quot;
how long will the equipment have to pull out in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
&quot; the connections from the commitment of the manufacturer , as well as from political pressure . &quot;
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long shall the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could last for three to four hours in the workshop .
&quot; time consuming , it could be an appointment . &quot;
&quot; what do drivers do that do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE should wait for .
&quot; probably foreign producers would withdraw , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive price comparison of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will fear that .
&quot; but , in the regions where the Fahr@@ enheit were dro@@ pping . &quot;
&quot; in rural area there is no worth@@ less value for older dies@@ els , so far . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale .

we do the city leb@@ ars
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes back to retirement next year . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applications are rare .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is . &quot;
and the work still makes it great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his success@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it ad@@ mi@@ red him , so far not to fulfill the demands profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer .
so - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of regular cancellation periods - still enough time for an elabor@@ ation .
&quot; since Has@@ lach has acted to the administrative community as a sub @-@ legal authority , the applicant must prove the appropriate assignment . &quot;
&quot; for this function , the city wants to keep the city . &quot;
&quot; if this wouldn &apos;t fill this anymore , they would have to travel to Offen@@ burg for consultation until Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and it is important to him , W@@ acker says about a good operating climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we are making the city &quot; worth &quot; , &quot; he is sure about the building site and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ floor parking place are an@@ cho@@ red . &quot;
the kin@@ dest bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium premises are still subject .
&quot; the latter alone will beat faster with approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
be designed for a city car@@ et@@ aker great game space .
Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted to many thanks .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green facilities will often be comm@@ end@@ ingly mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for what suits , &quot; if new@@ buildings are approved , the out@@ going city car@@ et@@ aker is emphas@@ ized . &quot;
he also bears high responsibility for the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; At the end , everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; with supervision and coordination , he can count on long @-@ standing number of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; as well as his successor remains , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if Roland W@@ acker wants to be buried , he was able to demonstrate his studies as a graduate engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree as a graduate engineer or a graduate engineer in the areas of construction and building planning law . &quot;

bicycle is thrown on lines : south route closed
&quot; according to the police , the un@@ familiar perpet@@ rators brought the blue bike from the railway track to the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ent freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and search for them since the night hours .
near the crime of witnesses a ro@@ sar@@ ist Roll@@ er@@ cian and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators had brought himself in great danger and is also endangered the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the delay , and the cost of rail transport could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; a total of &quot; considerable &quot; sum to go , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; the Friday morning , just under ten young people , two of them consider correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight rates did not fall , however , they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 meters of upper lines . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and fl@@ aps , recur@@ ring , loss of blood , loss of weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while people usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found researchers at the Washington university found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna declared that immune cells in the gut is patented to ensure the harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in food are not penet@@ rating in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are im@@ pover@@ ished , dissolve inflammation , are balanced out of cells that protect tolerance and protect the body , without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too low towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments it was noted that a type of tolerance of immun@@ o@@ zone in mice , which have a specific bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ate . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in her food , the more they had them of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich nutrition is toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ ils , if the same system will work with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral students of Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan sought a kind of immun@@ o@@ cells that promotes tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated separately . &quot;
&quot; it suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma of the mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but were missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they had l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria explo@@ res the immune system , the researchers sent L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then carried small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ ated cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ abol@@ ism , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the lining of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect the gast@@ ro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans develop as in mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of Dar@@ ms . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous values in the present of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed to &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
&quot; when Manchester United has signed a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria in Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the first 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the final season game before the UEFA Cup final against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed by Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was exp@@ elled from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of blues and managed to improve the M@@ our@@ in@@ ho only 45 minutes before starting the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ a and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to have three more new@@ com@@ ings , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four priority new@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; three of them get , thank you for the club , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they were four of four , but they gave themselves great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner inside the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew by Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
&quot; on the radar shiel@@ ds , the form of a dre@@ am@@ ers was to be . &quot;
the whole thing was a permanent test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new stroke for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , as the wind is turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the SPD boss , the prime minister &apos;s Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no distur@@ ban@@ ces from the party headquarters , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - this was the most important desire of the electoral fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ ruling state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; according to Schulz from the beginning of the year , Schulz would not have been described in the base with head@@ wind . &quot;
there were deep injuries .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and green . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green cannot be reliable , &quot; &quot; said CDU Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction@@ ing of a Green M@@ EPs over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the election @-@ election lost its red @-@ green coalition that her red @-@ green coalition led to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
&quot; Michael Kell@@ ner , co @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party leader El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ed , invited her mandate to return . &quot;
the transition to the CDU means a clear dis@@ appointment of the elec@@ tor .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the German state leader and election campaign in the Green Party Editor ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , but he sigh@@ s a SPD election , when Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message has reached the party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the collapse of the green M@@ EPs from El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CDU without their own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , calm the comra@@ des of stone . &quot;
&quot; according to the Parliament elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then worse - and it became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a deaf @-@ reel , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite cut the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after the weeks , the comra@@ des were ra@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; then , when she had prepared new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next fall .
&quot; Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ shed , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did in the crisis communication after that , so quite everything was wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Weil .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in the criticism of criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese um@@ devoured values came .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past few weeks , Weil was increasingly trying to put the acc@@ ents in the covenant . &quot;
&quot; the order of the former Mayor of Master from Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , was not hidden in comra@@ des by Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , because they talked of because a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in this case , because of the party internal , the Lower Saxony is basically no blame . &quot;
and Schulz don &apos;t even say .
&quot; sometimes , comra@@ des ende@@ av@@ our to stri@@ ve to hold its own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the revol@@ ting par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ines in T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy @-@ democratic , like Mr@@ s T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as a direct can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , but about the state list of the Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party , on the subject of the Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the logical consequence , it would be that she returns to her mandate . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters of voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a leader in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career appro@@ ves the election outcome of a future CDU dep@@ uties , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there is more or more detailed comm@@ it@@ ments of the CDU Nieder@@ sachsen has been given .
funding funds for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to gentle his home in the years will soon get support from the country .
&quot; over this , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler was again seeking a review of the so far .
since 1991 it has been in Emp@@ fingen san@@ itation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the restoration area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous san@@ itation is a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only close new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the information received by the Government of Karlsruhe , which will receive information that it will be a san@@ ction area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount will amount to 8@@ 33 333 euro , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation of Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishment then emerg@@ es ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler continues to investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; it is also a role , whether in the planned area of interest , to san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territorial borders may then shift again . &quot;
&quot; the ste@@ g occurred on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ countries program &quot; &quot; Social City , &quot; which would then be carried out in the framework . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the residential and employment relations and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be related to object , which means per land . &quot;
the restoration area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the payment period for the funding expired since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the inventory intake would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ positions will be made possible , so that in the coming year with the san@@ ction can be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commun@@ e had to carry out its own prec@@ urs@@ or studies .
&quot; it is therefore to evaluate the urban abuse , and decide when san@@ itation becomes and in which circum@@ ference . &quot;
&quot; for the respective property , a san@@ itation is also included in the basic book . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after Emp@@ fingen , and make a picture of the situation , she said . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project was the participation of those involved . &quot;
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and foundation bow , &quot; where it works among other things in the construction state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in grey questionnaire , &quot; household and homes &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
the blue &quot; plant arch &quot; can only be completed if in the building premises are operated .
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a motion for funding . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; - who first comes first orders first .
one could not make a funding for later . &quot;
&quot; to the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make a renovation . &quot;
British inventor himself sets up a micro@@ chip to come with a hand @-@ movement in the house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step to enter his office and can even start his car . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between fingers and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , a consult@@ an@@ aes@@ thet@@ ist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising cost of the white house cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicop@@ ters to South La@@ wn for an event , which fixes the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American builders . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a round trip through products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck was exhibited in Connecticut . &quot;
&quot; the White House of the White House demanded the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the record of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of its superior , the deputy Nav@@ al commander . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds , if the departure from the White House was delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original crew was found during the meeting during the helicopter , while security personnel remained at the ground during the time on the ground . &quot;
&quot; out of the TIM@@ E available , the recordings were not clear whether a second flight number was required . &quot;
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal government to use state ownership of political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander said . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was referred to the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave a violation of reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to con@@ strain the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically favourable purposes . &quot;
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation as the presidential plane before the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America , &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy director of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ations often lead training flights in the Washington area around Washington and South La@@ wn to expos@@ e the US president in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was in Germany at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise programmes in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flight rules for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicop@@ ters include 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved , helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ing drawings for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the US Ministry of Defense for the 2017 financial year , the Do@@ D replacement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the costs of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of an estimated estimates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual resources . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , demand rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into consideration the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans worked in@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is reasonable to emphas@@ ize it . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with helicop@@ ters when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire car . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and moved with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America the O@@ MV can harm
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump does not really worked on Wed@@ nes@@ days as he sat under the law to deep@@ ening the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his mind to en@@ act the law , the congress gave a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; in un@@ packed , corro@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the US prec@@ in@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design looks forward to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors of the Austrian O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed together with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic East Stream 2 in cooperation with other European companies . &quot;
the thr@@ illing is massive .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump still would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .

&quot; as of September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supplies in the urban kinder@@ garten ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , is this good news : &quot; we are all pleased with us . &quot;
cooked besides home : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked @-@ boiled co@@ ols .
&quot; the city operates 46 children &apos;s area in the Kre@@ fields Area , in 44 the children are given a hot meal for lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last day@@ year , 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also applicable in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; from 1 September 2014 onwards , 46 part @-@ time workers have heating up the fishing meals , add to the salad , raw food and fruits , Por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give food off , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides about the hours of hours .
&quot; the kitchen appliances are now fixed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because this is why it works : healthy food and cooking classes .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the Kü@@ ch@@ enk@@ ir@@ ans team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the task of cooling forces - is done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the quality improvement of the kitchen service , which they exhibited in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign currency for the city as the most economic , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time workers are re@@ set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education field , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , the UN says . &quot;
&quot; elections can be representative , if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , Chief of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women in the provinces in the provinces can be di@@ pping . three women can@@ di@@ ets for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women can &apos;t be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative and cre@@ dible , if women are unable to attend and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot;
&quot; Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential election will take place on April 5 , 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban have released threats against a selection process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international host@@ ilities to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will take power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ s@@ om said a strong role for women to rein@@ force Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
the Afghan independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make up a union with Man@@ age of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company held the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross site . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which presents beside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ al@@ manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; &quot; concerns the financing for modernis@@ ing production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can not win clarity over business needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross the future concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have been working here and the workforce are concentrated on the local community and the Big Room Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social benefits . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of job creation , wage and prosperity , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing living costs and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently urg@@ ently urg@@ ently urg@@ ently needed a flour@@ ishing production line at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ manager at Toll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB to Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the ongoing commitment at employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed the employees that we operate like all companies that are constantly growing in an extremely competitive and un@@ reliable business climate , our business is constantly growing - and this applies to all of our business areas and sites - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our rab@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of Toll@@ cross as a production facility and quite an end . should our business processes change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned for three years before Ne@@ y@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their persecution by Ne@@ y@@ mar in Paris , Paris Saint @-@ Germain warned about £ 189 million in its persecution , but they warned Barcelona for three years prior to the world record . &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has been heated in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ y@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages from more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way as Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way to outside , although a source in the vicinity of Catal@@ ans board is that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but the soccer world was warned about three years ago by PS@@ G pre@@ sidents before this view ?
&quot; when Manchester City has been interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they don &apos;t know if they touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but when they try to sign up one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G did clear that they could not allow it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their discounts for Ne@@ y@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report &quot; &quot; Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of mis@@ use crash@@ es Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report of the Miss@@ ing scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to take discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he expected from the former reg@@ aining Bishop Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express its deepest regret about their fore@@ fathers , or their then false evaluation of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican Chancellor &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that the coverage of violence on violence with &quot; two different measures &quot; will be measured . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the handles in Regensburg , no one knows that it might be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and is preparing the public opinion to keep it normally , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis was also in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you would like to go on the church and it &apos;s a red fres@@ her .
&quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; he had been a normal educational agent , &quot; to be done with friends as I was one . &quot;
&quot; you make it un@@ fair , today setting standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was written with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese in Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ed lawyer Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ ades and sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; together , so that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were applied . &quot;
the punishment for the pupils have just been able to drop the punishment for the pupils .
&quot; in contrast to numerous other states that many victims were inv@@ alu@@ able by R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview Hes@@ emann , why the final report for the Miss@@ ing scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains his opinion . &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence on Prot@@ eins &quot; by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dict@@ ory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he also appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , who has been hand@@ some of the ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was not a top performance . &quot;
how do you use this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , one must ask ones@@ elf why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
&quot; he has just been dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the non@@ violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its activity @-@ sphere .
&quot; you can dis@@ card it , too late , or first to take advantage of it too serious . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium , on which he worked , was experienced by practically all respondents as - as literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent witness , &quot; &quot; liter@@ al &quot; , &quot; sin@@ c@@ ere , &quot; &quot; liter@@ al &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; as extremely good teacher , who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always surrounded by children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority is worth over its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which led to wi@@ er@@ brü@@ ten times . &quot;
&quot; he did not only threw up with chairs and threw the key Federation on the ground , but also ear@@ ne@@ cked boys in the hair or ears , he had promised herself for years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for himself . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honor of honour , however , such correc@@ tions were in the fra@@ gment time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used in parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a national gy@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually in this report , namely the aw@@ ful sexual abuse and the violence on the pre@@ school , the fre@@ est@@ ingly excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; one is already asking if it is not to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as a brother from Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media are straight forward to him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood it , still ei@@ vable . &quot;
but the truth is : the report was loaded by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the context of the report , the report was reported very much about the subject of mis@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger filed a burden or complic@@ ity in relation to sexual abuse in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted with the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said one affected deputy for the others , &quot; &quot; it was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ ades @-@ Stud@@ ents R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have had tim@@ ely ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , assume that it can be accounted for ... Bu@@ ying on int@@ ru@@ sive or clear@@ er , or rather , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ants , Confi@@ denti@@ als , etc . &quot;
that one speaks about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in pre @-@ anticipated students and / or their environment confi@@ dential , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is responsible for each co @-@ knowledge . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad@@ vert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to this contradi@@ cted crime in connection , as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
in the media there was much of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s former Dom@@ en@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was indicted in the report &quot; Weg@@ ner . &quot;
has he to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in coverage had all mixed and dist@@ orted to a giant mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of inside , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is a mis@@ use of the report again .
&quot; for example , it is clean divided : between the pre@@ school and the high school of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexually abuse and violence as well as , let &apos;s say once more . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also four decades ago , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of seasonal teachers were forced and mal@@ ign@@ ited , they all took place at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be re@@ igns . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when she had already been at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; on that was , like most witnesses , the theme of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ dies &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline there , but no sa@@ vi@@ ish violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general Human@@ ity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the states on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just started to establish , and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( as the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut up the ears in front of the conditions ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this point , he indicates that he continues to be pract@@ ised in the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; already , in view of the risk of negative press services , he recommended urgent entry . &quot;
&quot; it was of course , of course , at a time when legal clarity had already been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , it took place in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows of us yet . &quot;
&quot; there was hard to estimate for him , where the victims may be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the allow@@ able limit was exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he would have gone away .
that is just not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s educational standards for the then time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak , as of &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck des An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate past today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already quite right .
&quot; but this is not true for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence at innocent children &apos;s camels , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally getting up .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ in@@ izing and punishment , so ear@@ mu@@ gs , and to pull the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he was also strictly held . &quot;
&quot; what is the picture of his reg@@ gae time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot; &quot;
was the subject of exam@@ ining even to language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , the domain bro@@ ader played only one side . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at all , I have no means that he carried out a strict regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said once : without this perfect discipline , without which in@@ unconditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and bond@@ ons only one makes out of rebelli@@ ous boy once a great singer and before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I really learned to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believers and heart @-@ good people , from whom you could not even imagine that he could only do a fly somewhat . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive , how many former domain bro@@ ods are still going to hold on him today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , he is almost blind - and he is treated like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him yet , so he once was strictly speaking to them , are definitely in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly it may be - but even a lov@@ able Resp@@ ect@@ son , to which they look still alive today and to honour them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything that acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were then on the agenda then . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ c@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; the evil intention that stands behind it is , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; because the report , which was just released , is dischar@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; now the inc@@ eption would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired large mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
