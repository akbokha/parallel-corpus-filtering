<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your sight to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt is to meet young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a tomb captains, where the tunnel will now be excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small bandmen generate the poor reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if the maps are not present.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that once had to be exciting because the car-Navi instead showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer by Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than current - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it is distinctly, as towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a Flickenteppich which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large overseen map were used for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were written according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and skipping the first surveying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the spring of 1800, Bavaria has been occupied with Austria since the second coalition war with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave up a topographical recording of Bayernin on behalf of course - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally went off with the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801, there were the present neighbors that created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph proceeded to continue the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the Urposition blatt on Munich is from 1856, and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in comparison to early / today, the capital of capital is most pressing."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the city has grown in all directions, and has grown rapidly."</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is submerged, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 card."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was celebrated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the base in the middle of the city lies."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses are concentrated in 1856, along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: when in the zooming, a smaller map with dozens of lines and figures: handwritten entries from the so-called" Urine, "which was derived from the basic tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers more - but small bandmen of the plant "Land in the Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is drawn north of submerged.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 takes place in the October 19th century, was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urpositional blade one reads in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, not only the street names" at Gasteig "or from the" "At the Lüeig" "- but also in big letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße once you locked up people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich circle-Irrenal was founded in 1858 / 59."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the establishment of the establishment of his psychiatrist, who was brought to King Ludwig II's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and finished, for example, the cops of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to tackle violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged for an exhibition with the Anstold. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"first place for 280 patients was first place, later expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes this capacity was no longer enough - the foundation for the construction of the Kreisirresiitentiary in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatatriots."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the site of the former Auer Anstalt, youth meet in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order bought the building complex in 1920, and moved it into a hostel with education."</seg>
<seg id="42">"located west, the football pitch of TSV Munich East, east residential houses of the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in architecture at the origin of origin of the Irrenees, who had been destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as" "main square", "the department store called" Kaufinger alley. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A crucial change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs broke out many holes in the city center."</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a tomb captains of the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof during those days and on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn stem distance."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the Schieberegler, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole in the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Reserved for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farthing has issued a warning for coloured people who are due to discriminating politics and the racist attacks by the state of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a series of fragile, racial-based events in the last state will be seen and indicated here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recent announcement of the law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionately on minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be beaten or killed because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist leaving against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under fragile circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol anymore during the journey through the State of Missouri, without being accused of crime without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report on the Office of the General Prosecutor's Office of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform about what might happen in Missouri," says Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready if there are Caucasia or the relatives have to know that they are travelling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"by 2015, Missouri recorded 100 pieces of hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the Hassi-report program of the FBI who entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain, a company for locating or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) were issued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) itwarnings for Texas and Arizona after the States of immigration authorities have committed to neglect people because of migrant workers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"the rules are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent times, stakeholders have applied the action as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidecay project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidecaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU and Kordula Kovac CDU and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"the Schwendemann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies, with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of the Schwendemann family."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann, initially granted insights into its operation, in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many as many young houses and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is for him the alternative failure way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">"at the table of the Ferihäste, exclusively regional."</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach, he described the Weidecay project as" elemental important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not tolerate steep surfaces on such a way.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green land care for a lot of work, a lot has to be processed with the hood sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elterian operation and retending these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence, and is happy about the leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in fact, I hope that the armor of the surfaces could be moved out for a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and do thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in the critique</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 pitches of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open-up area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be enforged until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half of the leader was promoted by leader, a district court carried the village of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmer stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of course."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and margins."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White, the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape-counties (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables the state conveyance of incense.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one from the lpr conveyor conveyor.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area should not be margable (hangover 35 percent) and must be threatened by the request."</seg>
<seg id="95">"currently, for the fishing bacher Weidezvous project 2018, the application for eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just 16 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the accounting area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the White House of Trump takes off the Statue of Liberty now"</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these equally like every other - hence the sorrows staged by Saddam Hussein's first place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic Axt in a heated battle with Jim Acosta from CNN concerning the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller doesn't hold the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and liberty-Imitators would have tasted him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he touched their importance, and in particular the importance that you have been attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his basis."</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta coated: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer, was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is feeling properly, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the awful words of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and to breathe freely, and to breathe freely; the poor of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elating waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly stated that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and their friends, who used to place their words after their death at the base, knew very well that she was a high-political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and Americanism, in which they presented the feminine embodiment of freedom in a abused classical picture."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a completely different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, people wanted to change it from the right wing this long."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty advocates that the American flame is in the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a matter of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see how they had seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the Decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of human beings, seeking refuge and improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of welcome you have to hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is, of course, not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever wanted to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when just two Scots of Britain belonged to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland developed something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue to find out until we'll find out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">"the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with him, what they have done."</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of the circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butal - which was to compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was chosen to team captain captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her capitals was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eiliie, of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete with their fifth world championships for the 400 m hurdle, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"in the past year, Muir leads five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will be participating at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to observe the victory for the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world champion when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team capitalists says that they are" enormously proud "on the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but also in some cases also among the medals and the Finns."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be team captain, is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and have chosen me, makes it something special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to Pockles."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech regarding the capitals?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so, it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it that we are again at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it simply will be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public post when you don't wear it from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the papers struck him because of all, from interior politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he responds to criticism, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in the year 1783 Washington declared:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we become like sheep for the slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it, more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online review was full of a reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary coat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electors and play his haarless head following chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, blocking of persons, which come on the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax-dollars - unnecessarily, and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing further than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolley or spammers or hasseted people using the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, and none."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The parish priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarani of Bowie, Md., was not hassmet, but she asked to hate Hasselt."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented as polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and breaking the latest news," she wrote in the commentary section of the message "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea as a number of people in the same theme, then they will be regarded as a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what are the employees of the governors as" concentrated spam attack, "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time, when you had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladders and to burn down demonstrators and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happens just digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants to be criticized for Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, the First Amendment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, proclaimed a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers drafted between 1776 and 1800, and Anonyms briefs beat on his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonyme trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Belisarius, "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"Petitioning, who criticised his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom, have been overwhelmed by the historical documents that were collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put her silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former Europeans no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>

<seg id="216">"I didn't defend the Extremadura Open, since they had won them in the year after I had won them out of the program."</seg>
<seg id="217">Back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories come back from last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon, last year to win."</seg>

<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," said ORR, the man from Helensburgh. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also felt this additional pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing back and I played a solid Golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm glad about how it went so far.</seg>
<seg id="227">"with the trio on the field, the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNish."</seg>

<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we must fit even better in Aue," says the defenders of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Erzgebirge mountains, the rotation chain should also be optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a fool after a freighteousness, the Fortunae would like to catch even more."</seg>

<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better after the experience in preparation with the turning chain, than with the four-chain."</seg>
<seg id="868">"yet, I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is his thing for sure, "because we just can build on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"requirement is, however, that we are even better harmonious and we do not afford so many aborted errors."</seg>

<seg id="877">"but they do not know as much as 100% where they are currently standing," says the defense of the Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">The guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the Encounter (almost) finished stadium of Aue.</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we go away, only because we have the claim to come under the first six is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Aue of nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="887">"until today, Migrations has shipped 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person might be "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is under 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are carried out only in cases where the person's age is asked.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are durable in recent months."</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has unpacked their pockets.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger area," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I showed me this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I made me love in love and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet were completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a dirty layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose she instructed the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without leaving us to gaps."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about to build a simple platform, but the steel that it had the right height or below the right height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan, to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine you can see a classic copper light from Retrouvius via the glamorous area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of skewers plays a role in adding theatres, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can exclude the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">"so, the special thing is that it is about a garage door."</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineering art went into", "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite to it, so if you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne offers additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to increase the floor area and use high-quality materials, which make room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and are therefore helping to create an emotional ties in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself into electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and elevated square metering of some standardocre in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide to leave this."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if yes, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an equivalent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, participated in his first working day with conducting employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he would repair: bad information taken into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly told the employees that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media processor."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television goes back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was annoyed due to a fair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February to POLITICO. "</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign agents could do something that we do not know - that Trumps tweets have not included more ignition with their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">"probably, we will never experience something about the tweets that Trump is not sent."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"when his staff had made it a few times, trouble from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has consistently been able to prevent drump controversy."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem exists in the fact that people in a white house, which are competing in a white house, are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting trump material, possibly promotes their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - with this story - reported in May about the preference of counselors, president of strategic reasons doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press pieces, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he might find out what they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that happened at the end of February when somebody called the President bössing a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, who accused the Deputy Stabiliated Katie Walsh," the source behind a heap of his leaks in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been banished to Twitter permanently from Twitter, or that he has no specific evidence, or that he expressed misvows in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving to influence."</seg>

<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the Board recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "under appeal to the job."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the CNN broadcasts, it is already the first loading of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps and a Russian lawyer."</seg>

<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Commissler Trump personally looked into the centre and find the accusation, whether the President may implored the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Lawys is to examine and decide the evidence in possible fragile cases, and to decide whether the charges shall be charged."</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent of climate change has played a role in the crash of the ice has been unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, since about 30 years a series of unusual merges in the region, the U.S. Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a factorment."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, the exploration can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colon was so far a part of the Larsen-C scarf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Scheleventh swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">"therefore, it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcelebrated is located south of South America almost at the head of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there is quite a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Scheleventh time is in danger, because the front edge had never been withdrawn as far as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"moreover, the ice plate is under tension and can be destroyed, if a piece of keys can be cut off."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Scheleventh and Eisberg increases the sea level, since they swim in the water and pushes the ice so much water, as it gives it to the melt itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of serpentsises indicates that the glaciers are directly into the sea, and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level, but only in low measurements, the British research project writes about the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI-C, the Larsen-C-Schelcelebrated is the fourth biggest sheleventh time of Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"on the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice plate is now in a dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most extensive retreat since the start of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"under scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Scheleventh time will be back again, and possibly return to the long-term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models will say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers have not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to change climate change, so in the past few decades a lot of ice rinkles were destroyed during the Antarctic Peninsula."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends toward South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>

<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children in the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the space: opponent, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug dingggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the behest list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there are no rest from the violence, and during the whole country the bodies are common, more journalists are always employed: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have reached his office in December 2012. there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is experienced deep, even though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice. "two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts, who will be able to show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamanian."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a German Federal Office was built in 2010 to process journalists from journalists, these were only two criminal proceedings under the committee to protect journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organisational crimes each year, the murderers of journalists are only rare in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa while they are incomforting, even though the Terrain is still tilted."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the killer, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the Why, we miss all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times, probably due to the name of the newspaper, who is translated into the" 12th river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter rode away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly to Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing on the topic of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans has been arrested for the last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloody battlefields of the country as rivaling factions here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road, or that the cemetery is full of injured, two-story mausoleums for drug people who are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget it for a minute that there is a state of" rest, "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"initially, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of a rivaling antitational fractions in war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the sons, suspects gear members bought each copy of the output, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper that had the same story to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long to take his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined together with five colleagues at the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars involved.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without paying attention to the robberote problem, "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, hard treffing investigations without fear to publish censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else had to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for its reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for protection of journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where ever she led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in October last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take the task that you get as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done for so many more. why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird that could curse, the friend who was generously with hugs and ratings, a teacher, who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always walk to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask: was his love for routine, being a routine?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own lawyers in question, how they do best do and live in the life."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you have their wives, their children, their little shops, their home runways and runways to move on drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-aging and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it smells wrong, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, not just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"suddenly, no mobile phones met at Riodoce for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days before, Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">"they were commissioned by the state government, to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a central-class area of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporter asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of policemen who were the governor even as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountains, where the drug fighters are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce laid on three main layers."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state spending, which focused on the home town of the Governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about it, who has been kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politics, which ruled the regent Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high karaoke cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter, to write about previous events in this local restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went down to a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously, we knew what happened," "Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El FLACO" "because of its slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sticker, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez made a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning, because of another journalist at the Office of the Prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists had become stronger, by organizing protests in organised protests" SOS Press. ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pronounce journalists and to kill them, because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has since then asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is worried that their anger has violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists were surrounded by the organisational crimes, involved government officials and an equivaled society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco journalism "he wrote that reporters not only have to be killed by drugs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the Media Group" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because she would like to hold the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern boundary of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"in addition to their separate head, computer keyboard and headphones."</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua according to the assassination of the Miroslava Breach.</seg>
<seg id="1903">"others continue, as it did El manana by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004."</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly established the drug box with a Editorial on the title page titled "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it's hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, like the photographer Ruben Espinosa who, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue to stay and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, gives that the drug trafficking is troubled."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the premises in front of the office and drinking beer, when all their phones began to summed up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shooting paintings with bandenrivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war ripped on how it was promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the Bordstles, they have news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heels near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen, the guards stopped to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the legendary founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff followed by Riodoce followed his traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think of it," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day when Javier was murdered, the practitioners asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to deviate his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, though a terrifying."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinorns of a Canadian miners were so well preserved that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well preserved that they could even determine that his flaky skin was from a reddish brown - and they said she could have had something from a "unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "called it as" the extinction of the dinosaurs, which has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably good condition, researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable, ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he joined Suncor Millenium Mine at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something which seemed out of the surrounding rocks at the square, and decided to be more precise."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main writer Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best dinosaurs specimens, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with a armor, resembles a wanding tanks, probably threatened by meat carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily geared dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predatory, and used a parachute technology that is known as a counterfatting that is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings and to evade his enemies, experts say that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"the 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier, made headlines in May, and is now able to see the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in May."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours in order to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sheds and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conshady, an widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature darker was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the consistency is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution has improved the confrontation with the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the contertiers - think of Rehe, zebras or armovers - are much smaller and injurious than loot, what signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strong geared dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been", "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales are also showing that the skin of the dinosaur-brown was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists will continue to study the animal on notes about his life, including his consertation, to figure out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and pushed into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South-orida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with congenital skin, but also in three dimensions and maintain the original form of the animal, Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost identical, like in the early Cretaceous period."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous was a time, as huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the earth moved through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this is part of the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists who appear in the journal current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was lost after the death in the sea and in mud mumified."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creation was found by Shawn Funk, when he finished in the Suncor Millenium Mine at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to thigh."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures had an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters flowed through the western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the agitation of the dinosaurs kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remaining remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the Hautread still cover bumpkin plates along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"rocky remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot is situated on his side, his five fingers are split up."</seg>

<seg id="2030">"she laid their mobile phone, in order to become a Tweet on the Canfield-Drive on the evening."</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police band and people, the crying out, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she observed a live feed, where a policeman stood by demonstrators with a rebellious dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that another policeman told his rifle and cried, saying," I will all kill you... ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "Ferrell remembered her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, which we have used to accustomed to us and that we can be typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at this moment, I felt contills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people living in community and the streets to challenge answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two have a conversation that they had many times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight, what they believe?" reminded her what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it has to know, and it will see and on it."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also known to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the lucky fortune to give her an experience in which they personally experienced no eky racism, it is no different than the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel the feeling I would have a poor service to keep it away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was at a campground when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business partner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped them to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"after 9 August, my activism changed completely," "she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurse Association and concentrated on food justice and health qualities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, just wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question was Ferrell in the sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised up their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestract occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak "said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be depicted."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on hereling experience - to show that it is not a" "Messiah" "movement, but in order to come together," "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participants of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents by" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelel's life as she loves and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be certain injuries in this work, and for the human-purpose of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"furthermore, Ferrelle's history repeatedly repeats the role of the black gay women in the broader Black Lives Movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have minted the film" BlacklivesMatter "in the social media after the killing of the black teens in 2012, identified as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in all," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling at various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"folayan agreed to notice, that" the movement is really held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" "this is not an affirmative type of action," where Ferrell was chosen because of their identity as a heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front front, because with a life on these cruises than a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson has disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to remain."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is placed on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social and social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos.</seg>
<seg id="2083">"yet she kles herself to a singing and she feels obliged to remember this memory, since she walked three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size mad": TV-reader discuss a bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-Gallery moves the people, although it is not built for long."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre in the south of the pedestrian street has been obsolete since the first presentation of 2009 in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the theme is hardly any one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while they say," "this would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "that would be real class" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "does not need a person" "(Siggi) or simply:" "size" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates are building that a gallery has more customers in the city, including all other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmers market stands, in which 13 direct market shares offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction, construction will be completed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery creators want to integrate a Markthalle in the new building - and for Beda-Platz to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we've been buying almost weekly in the farmer market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of Landwives always happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery, a chance is to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also that."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" whether direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this is likely to be low in the new project, but not even low."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why are buying items in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, droplings or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many cargo shops are empty - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here, however, there is not once a regular weekly market, it is the more important that we have received at least the Markthalle."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"because all the goods offered there is freshly prepared, most of them are offered directly from the producer and is obendously cheap."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you see, shop stores in a shopping mall only rented out of larger companies, because the dorm are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special businesss exist almost no more and what is still left, will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market rise during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration, when the Bit Gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it already creating the ghosts bit gallery beforehand to drive all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"after my view, it would have been better to promote a real estate market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer market hall there is no more space thanks to what I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which depend on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hair pieces made by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analytics had been a 35-year sentence, after they publicly made diplomatic reports about the website of WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on August 2, is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman, and left dissidents, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama as he only had three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Manning, such as someone could look like with these genomic data, such as someone may be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been talking about the identification as a woman, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spying act, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"due to the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photograph - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is deliberately sitting on a driver's seat and has been associated with a platinblonde."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was just coming from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this way, the artist portraits of strangers from forenical Artefacts such as cigars and chewing gum produced by removing the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg, at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were too unequal letters that exchanged several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"she even created an exhibition of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would predicted a future in which the President Chelens would consider and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"only a few days after the book was published, Mannings had been released for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy gathering."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a little depth and Starke at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweeters, which he actually should fix it further."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg, after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen out of a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a wall of the gallery's artistic statement, Manning urged with its superior signature among them (the" i "in their family name) an end of the" automatic shredder, their foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide, according to the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work is from 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the above mentioned comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, as she is faced with a Freisener Hoefon in hand from the disciplines of the United States, like King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they chill your speech, they won it," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never just the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - just as it was going to do in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of space of masks, from their own genomic simulation, which summarises themselves as hordes of protestors."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also aimed at targeted as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature), which had been written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people," Dewey-Hagborg, "said Dewey-Hagborg,"</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes who is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly thought emotionally."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that 2017 can't even be a crazier, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny about it, but the company provide a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey at the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sexpuppen have developed themselves from their inflatable partners to robots, with a silicone retina, which feels warm, with aware of human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust its robots according to its beliefs" "and select everything, from the eye-colour of the robot via the form of nipples to the type or colour of its fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will still worry, as many robots have the" personalities "who would like to make a Stepford-woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots using a silicone retina.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing, such as tifications."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there's the" "Frigid Farrah" developed by True Companion, with preprogrammed figures such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of intimidated and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous personality." "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she may like what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she has also heard their voting rights - as real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed to conversation, or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many beatifying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjection of female relations, though you take a step on Frigid (called here: opposed) Farrah, disruptive one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy with an vibration but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men no Roxxxy have?" "it's on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and its increasing refinement point to a little darker and deep breath in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes, to a desire for sex with subjugation as optional adding."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men of course do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices its rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is leakened out of the Random zones, can be found in regards to the spirit of time, in which we live, very educational."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or irritated until they are the free market for this permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain concision that these high-developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a presidents in the White House, who spoke to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most awesome aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Woman ') are not the graphic pictures, the worn body and an outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots exists to create physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their peas, they want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, at the point, when it comes to their" personalities, "robots are no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't take away from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"you don't have a mediation or a background history, nothing that could disturb anything on independence or anything, which could disturb the imagination of total failure."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"in order to see the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left hand was strengthened by trump, but the basic effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the graceful opportunity to get off his kitten of a day no longer."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there are still a frightened long-term scenario, in which Trump of Republicans of the right wing" normalized "which appear at once in comparison to its standards as the epitome of deceitfulness."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I can now find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the decline, the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked out) - which was both compared to Trump in fact one as very mild offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"if Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans may only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an unbearable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2441">"so many clutees of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are being familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not be just a dream."</seg>
<seg id="2442">"thirty-five years later, and I am still not all over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London."</seg>
<seg id="2443">"however, Central Park Carusousel is still a strange magical experience since there are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s and have all had a great time."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flaps, recurring, loss of blood, loss of weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while people usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found researchers at the Washington university found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna declared that immune cells in the gut is patented to ensure the harmful microbes that hide themselves in food are not penetrating in the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are impoverished, dissolve inflammation, are balanced out of cells that protect tolerance and protect the body, without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too low towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments it was noted that a type of tolerance of immunozone in mice, which have a specific bacterium in its initiate."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in her food, the more they had them of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan-rich nutrition is tolerant, less inflammatory boils, if the same system will work with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral students of Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan sought a kind of immunocells that promotes tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated separately."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbioma of the mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were drawn up in a sterile environment, so that they had lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria explores the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then carried small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-tolerated cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect the gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri the cells in humans develop as in mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease. "</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of Darms. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanous values in the present of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440 page report, which was presented by the diocese in Regensburg with the Enlightened lawyer Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of overprint, 67 Domspades and sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" together, so that by Domenellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for the pupils have just been able to drop the punishment for the pupils.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other states that many victims were invaluable by R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview Hesemann, why the final report for the Missing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence on Proteins" by the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise his" Humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"he also appears as a Choleriker and Perfection, who has been handsome of the öfteren when a Domspatz was not a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, one must ask oneself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he has just been dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonviolence at the preschool took place outside of its activity-sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can discard it, too late, or first to take advantage of it too serious."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzymnasium, on which he worked, was experienced by practically all respondents as - as literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent witness," "literal", "sincere," "literal" and "understandable," as extremely good teacher, who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons, and "always surrounded by children." "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is worth over its perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which led to wierbrüten times."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only threw up with chairs and threw the key Federation on the ground, but also earnecked boys in the hair or ears, he had promised herself for years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for himself."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honor of honour, however, such corrections were in the fragment time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used in parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a secular school, a national gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually in this report, namely the awful sexual abuse and the violence on the preschool, the freestingly excavation."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one is already asking if it is not to do with his acquaintness and his role as a brother from Benedict XVI, that many media are straight forward to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood it, still eivable."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report was loaded by Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the context of the report, the report was reported very much about the subject of misuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger filed a burden or complicity in relation to sexual abuse in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted with the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "said one affected deputy for the others," "it was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they trusted not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspades-Students Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have had timely (Georg Ratzinger).</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, assume that it can be accounted for... Buying on intrusive or clearer, or rather, as opposed to their parents, internatants, Confidentials, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that in pre-anticipated students and / or their environment confidential, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is responsible for each co-knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the advert."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to this contradicted crime in connection, as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Georg Ratzinger's former Domenmeister Georg Ratzinger was indicted in the report "Wegner."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Has he to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in coverage had all mixed and distorted to a giant melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of inside, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is a misuse of the report again.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"for example, it is clean divided: between the preschool and the high school of Domspatzen, between sexually abuse and violence as well as, let's say once more."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also four decades ago, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of seasonal teachers were forced and malignited, they all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have to be reigns."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when she had already been at the Domspatzymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, like most witnesses, the theme of" preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradies" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline there, but no saviish violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims were estimating the general Humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation remains to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the states on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just started to establish, and from the predecessors at a school where he had not worked and responsible, (as the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger shut up the ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this point, he indicates that he continues to be practised in the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already, in view of the risk of negative press services, he recommended urgent entry."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"it was of course, of course, at a time when legal clarity had already been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it took place in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows of us yet."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was hard to estimate for him, where the victims may be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the allowable limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he would have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards for the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we speak, as of" Fallstrick des Anachronism, "thus the danger to evaluate past today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is not true for sexual abuse, who was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence at innocent children's camels, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it is finally getting up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplinizing and punishment, so earmugs, and to pull the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he was also strictly held."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what is the picture of his reggae time, Georg Ratzinger has given you for the book" My Brother of the Pope "?" "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of examining even to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, the domain broader played only one side."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, at all, I have no means that he carried out a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said once: without this perfect discipline, without which inunconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of Weltrang, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and bondons only one makes out of rebellious boy once a great singer and before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I really learned to know Georg Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believers and heart-good people, from whom you could not even imagine that he could only do a fly somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive, how many former domain broods are still going to hold on him today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, he is almost blind - and he is treated like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him yet, so he once was strictly speaking to them, are definitely in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly it may be - but even a lovable Respectson, to which they look still alive today and to honour them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything that accuses to him are educational methods that were then on the agenda then."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man only because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make the medial sincere."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intention that stands behind it is, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"because the report, which was just released, is discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the inception would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired large merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
