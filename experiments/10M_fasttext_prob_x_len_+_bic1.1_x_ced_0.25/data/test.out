&quot; I &apos;m always fitted in drawers , or get glu@@ ed out of the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t even have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; the actress spend their time at home , scre@@ am TVs with lo@@ cker@@ ish D@@ utt and Mexican food , it says in the magazine . &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf teacher in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues a little variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
&quot; for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere . &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered her holiday , they ch@@ ased at the fast gal@@ lop of home to feed . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; so that the riding career ended , then again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he left his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not wear a photo . &quot;
&quot; it was the first time in Aachen , and thus at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid delivered the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to sympath@@ etic athletes .
&quot; cross country championships , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen already sha@@ ken him .
long is the 18th winner of the pyr@@ am@@ pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only granted for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring since decades .
&quot; and so , he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 more outstanding Sport@@ s@@ ers , the two @-@ fold U.S. mast winner was included in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the tables are among the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ des and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ cave and pos@@ thum@@ um of the hand of Erhard . &quot;
many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained a distance to the large animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - we want to prevent both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential applicants are subject to tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against it , as the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to strike the economy , and regulate the economy , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will re@@ sign tu@@ uli@@ sts massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , he has opened dis@@ advant@@ ageous opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the tax for the rich will increase , says they . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the needs to be invested in , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost immediately . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are refused by state @-@ critical te@@ ac@@ y wings of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; in Tr@@ ump , there might be a party internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and return the coal transport in the USA .
oil promotion should also be possible to date protected areas in the un@@ protected areas of Paris .
&quot; in contrast to its investment program , Clinton will explicitly extend the renewable energies and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be there . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ azi@@ de trading agreement , will not sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , both of the US do not want to protect from international trade - just better protect American jobs . &quot;
they should then be paid better then for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
she wants to increase it to 15 dollars an hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage needs to be , then he says he would not be altered . &quot;
&quot; however , the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax politics of the two camps . &quot;
&quot; on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to stim@@ ulate the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him ahead , so the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton is standing at least from the rich who wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
flight : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has gained experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women , who flee alone , almost everyday life . &quot;
&quot; if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women sitting .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ essed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she not@@ ices that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the division of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social help in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
&quot; they live in the Munich north , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich female aid . &quot;
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no other men - not as visitors .
the exception is an wa@@ ist in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : every woman who comes here has made experience with sexual violence here , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted , because they send torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honour , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , the further continues . &quot;
&quot; that tu@@ g@@ boat challenge such a bottle of water a sexual action , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that as soon as they come to Germany , he tells us . &quot;
&quot; even here , women in refugee quot@@ ations often would be regarded as minim@@ alistic and ab@@ used in its worst case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 per cent of women living in the middle of the Munich North , traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are not voluntarily taken up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to say that they don &apos;t say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help to help , there are more accommodations just for them , calls for . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District committees for the accommodation of refugees are responsible . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they responded by a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with No . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in the governments of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ sidents of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some common accommodation floors or private homes only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is low Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &apos; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women are accommod@@ ated together , men and women can be found together - persistent - violence against women come . &quot;
&quot; especially the shower room should be separated and accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much can women feel this protective needs , one can read on the con@@ sign@@ ment that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been talking about that there is us , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants st@@ icking : recei@@ v@@ ables for new jobs
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to adopt new jobs during their disp@@ utes in regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire advice from the beginning of September more working events .
J@@ DC said that there would be ministers who were worried about the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students have agreed upon the re@@ jection of a contract that agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; at 58 % of its members , he refused to vote in the elections . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chair@@ woman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government had stopped to problems whatsoever , that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; In view of what &apos;s the J@@ DC management board agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract , the official new negotiations for all E@@ igh@@ te@@ es are concerned . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has made a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to begin a running program of cal@@ endars , which begins in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ utes resulted in the fact that assistant doctors saw this year six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; according to the election of the agreed contra@@ ctual conditions , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana was the leader of the agreed contra@@ ctual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt , said that the treaty for physicians would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of pro@@ claiming the words of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot defend the expression that Ankara wants to be the most reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a blow , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was very narrow , and he hardly felt heat , even for its rest@@ rained conditions . &quot;
&quot; Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , however , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved so much , than would never happen anything . &quot;
&quot; to me , enthusiasm seemed rather to interpre@@ t the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but Putin met Putin that the state of State of Russia , however , showed that the state of State of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the surplus of a Russian fighter @-@ plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ lessly .
Putin par@@ ted and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back .
&quot; even bigger , as it was committed by a friend of my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; building up again , it becomes difficult when not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a strong , un@@ restricted assault on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once again , it seemed to be the Turks to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benef@@ ited from illegal oil traff@@ icking in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting was only held because Putin received the debt of the President of Erdo@@ gan who wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear at hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is first of all the friends who he can get after he has got almost his am@@ assed last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resumed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal tower in the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the national television forecast for fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agriculture imports are allowed again . &quot;
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry for the West as it considers his reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll comes across the snow@@ y cont@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ vot@@ al to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state leader won a bonus that he asked for the attempted coup d &quot; support for the chosen state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a self @-@ understand@@ able thing for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regim@@ en . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace made it possible by Russia and Turkey , one as it described me an analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of out@@ sides &quot; : two countries that were cut off from the West and feel bad , and now serve . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey will support objec@@ tion@@ able pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be notable that after almost three hours , both pre@@ sidents were held on the press conference , that they would not even stri@@ ped out . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey susp@@ ects it to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
&quot; there is no unique con@@ sensus about it , where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot;
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disp@@ er@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey took off the Russian battle jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand must be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s head of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has now dist@@ anced itself , when it had to be saved almost eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this period , brand names &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consumer brands . &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on Spon@@ sor@@ ing from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
&quot; but now she has decided to focus more national brands in the focus . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the head office and the stock exchange to Nat@@ west . &quot;
Ul@@ ster &apos;s brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller trademarks for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand , as well as the brand in which our employees will be busy as we are now going to be a bank of brands . &quot;
R@@ BS was used to become a global brand as the Bank itself .
&quot; now I say that we don &apos;t track global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work among these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not be able to run his Six @-@ Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and will increase the perception of various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , as we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our clients and launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think it will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double with New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th gain &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 year old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches milestone in the flat race .
&quot; Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the dre@@ im@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional because my family is also here &quot;
I am very happy about that it is about New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ quet Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ers when he re@@ covering the victory in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the steep@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career training &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey the Modern and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone in just a few years ago .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thr@@ illed fans since years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie before some weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already brought 6,000 gains if he would not only be one weekend and great tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has been winning almost 30 years of winning players who is great .
&quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British flat screen for two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month sper@@ re , but he showed a stunning strength to resist his two fl@@ ushes and to return to his top shape . &quot;
&quot; and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said before , that he wants to keep up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 45 years of age . &quot;
Russian Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to release his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the closest confidenti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin also ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in 1972 , in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later leader of the head of the government and head of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government , to support your activity as head of state and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
&quot; Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V have asked to leave his position , and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor . &quot;
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for Soviet intelligence service to K@@ GB .
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff appeared on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the fat content of the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power combat ?
nobody knows that .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man , who once asked as potential president , would like to conduct Russian environmental policy - met great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin that c@@ ites on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said it &apos;s true that I have asked you to trust this very complicated item in early 2012 - I could almost say - advert@@ ently for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the position in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ bility Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB was appointed , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could be President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term in office , since a third term of Putin viol@@ ate the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this item was taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
&quot; Putin was Prime Minister , before he became President of three and a half years later . &quot;
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after having struck producers

ri@@ dd@@ les to fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff asked for the identification of fish help in which he appeared in the Ban@@ ff garden .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale who were moved by a fountain of fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of spectac@@ le in hope that someone might throw a little light on the appearance of two inches long fish . &quot;
number of Crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of Queensland , Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is connected with fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; stud @-@ blo@@ wers &quot; to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sw@@ amps . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to get off from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of Queens@@ u Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering at this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel , which were used for this part of the bridge alone . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ ite activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bri@@ de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the de@@ cks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the lock @-@ proof high and deep @-@ structure represents . &quot;
&quot; after installation of the last street section and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the North or rural side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern entran@@ ces bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and very delicate work at the same time .
&quot; massi@@ vely , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to move up to about 3 % at an ascent . &quot;
&quot; the toler@@ ances , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have a good luck to be alive , after they were cast out of their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat was moved from their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat was turned around , and the worst before , &quot; said the director of the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones &apos; rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the wind blo@@ ws the boat apart from their range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from 60 years old and on a bu@@ o@@ ily without the life@@ jacket . &quot;
&quot; they came all aboard the coastal area , and were brought back to the rescue station &quot;
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , were lucky to hurt and be still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had a not@@ ch , but this dis@@ b@@ anded in the boiler of the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has grown about these men today .
seriously injured - man impres@@ ses her ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police divided yesterday , the 50 year old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the soft perpet@@ rators cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when they came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed twice to them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hands and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ arm@@ im@@ pover@@ ished his sister .
together with their partner the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her life . &quot;
&quot; on the street , they met the husband &apos;s former partner . &quot;
&quot; once the two women stepped out the apartment again , the 50 year old his sister to his sister and his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green : investors are to become a lot stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig is going to lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next years ?
the SPD proposes an &quot; action concept &quot; in the coming rating .
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first , it is about the question : who should actually build the affordable housing ? &quot;
a regulation is missing .
&quot; Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we are with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , must show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the affordable housing can also be created in the stock . &quot;
&quot; the great dispute in the town hall was , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how about investors who want to build on private faces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such areas as at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
a new urban housing project which will cost millions and will have to be financed by inc@@ enti@@ ves .
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as a few regulations .
the left is still tough@@ er to investors .
&quot; regardless of what , the Brat@@ mann , the Flag is a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
the action concept will be implemented and will provide additional tasks in construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program does not stand fully : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments , whose promotion will be running in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the planning spokesperson on Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments again back to the price integration . &quot;
this is possible in the West City .
a blow would solve the problem .
&quot; for the end of the Western city , the dead@@ lines run from the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could bring back to the price of cheap apartments there . &quot;
only : these are the owners who do not build homes .
&quot; since the number of social housing in the West city is dra@@ stically increased , it is removed by the aim of the so @-@ called . &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens therefore reck@@ on that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke , said : &quot; a vast majority must be the CDU with the boat . &quot;
this has been concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet another compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is intri@@ gu@@ ing to see how the world changes .
&quot; that te@@ ens and child are no longer going to go outside , but rather they prefer to spend their free time , on screens , was be@@ wit@@ ched in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , people go to get people from the sofa and to be more active . &quot;
&quot; the screen at the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other . &quot;
&quot; I am confident of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were based on the characters , which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed by a cartoon series , playing cards and other sp@@ in off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture sank to the interest of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot;
&quot; within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that follow with a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; taken cap@@ tive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the wreck and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps , which re@@ verses the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ovascular , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35.000 users , recently divided the number of people after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance upgrades .
&quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to bring to &quot; &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; to be able to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day active on deaf ears , because many public messages are getting boring and they are coming from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the significance of sport can not be assessed . &quot;
&quot; whoever is driving a regular sports , reduces its chances to get cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to use them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that it is fun . &quot;
&quot; therefore , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people close hunt even new friends .
&quot; as always , there is also m@@ ür@@ tic playing cards that always have to complain about anything . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should I do ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphones apps like Fit@@ bit earlier have already been able to pursue our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with the time .
&quot; however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ates in real world and will help many people in the hunt , an active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
stunning on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now also the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American tur@@ ner@@ gies on Thursday for the multi@@ campaign itel and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ man@@ sk@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ tle at the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es during the individual majority of women in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American player , who wins a multi @-@ guil@@ d and a total of fifth , while holding its reputation , the best of their generation , or even ever . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when their final score was shown and their long journey was ended at that moment . &quot;
&quot; this success presents her in the same league , as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years of its sport , 15 world medals , including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision , that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on from her said that she has ever seen the best gy@@ mn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expected to last a last test in Brazil , a contest which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other , after having won gold and silver in the individual majority of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she was in retirement of the retirement party , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on top , during their long way@@ ward to have never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child , was adopted by a trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school tour in the gy@@ mn@@ asium , was transformed into force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition for the competition , a victory that will keep as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two turns , the image dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Champion title .
&quot; again , she again took up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating floor - and set it on with 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished she soft@@ ly when she saw her final funeral - a pure form@@ ality - and tears abo@@ de on Bil@@ it brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , described as the vision they once described in their collection . &quot;
&quot; the achievement Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went in a deep@@ ness of Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ old man had called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercising , she threw the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; as it affects , the twe@@ eter @-@ wide twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds from the start of this week has a very new significance : &quot;
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ations in the car .
&quot; according to the police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot that in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first series of series of series , they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the triple murder did not have been the result of a rob@@ ber , because the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 participating in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said , that the shooting of the investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ators to be aware of whether they are linked to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed seven people and two more injured in nine attacks in nine months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expos@@ e the evidence that they have been associated to the conclusion that attacks are associated and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
&quot; a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them , to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music . &quot;
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which is an empty pickup @-@ truck for half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and is assumed that it was the work of series production . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the fe@@ west of his aging , Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I made it not . &quot;
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let myself .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has let itself down , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her has been informed that Edmund she could never recognise them under circumstances , and he may not even survive . &quot;
&quot; some doctors even went so far , that they proposed to institutional him . &quot;
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a salary .
&quot; Edmund could neither sit nor sit down to his third year , nor can &apos;t speak . &quot;
but he is making progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and to sing .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring a drawing language at &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but there is no typical character language -- says she . Edmund invented some signs alone .
micro @-@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic such as at Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Z@@ ik@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forec@@ asting can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it is related to life with the Z@@ ik@@ avirus Indians .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
&quot; for a long time , I was asked for a long time after the forecast , because I didn &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth@@ damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

ste@@ ele said that Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a community requested ten thousand sand@@ bags only .
a flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on the rain in this area .
&quot; on Friday , a flood system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , are reaching a record level of li@@ kel@@ ing over the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could survive many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream @-@ down@@ stream flood in A@@ scen@@ sion is a danger , because these rivers run only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; ticket ven@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi National border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest point on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;

&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house , over night strongly rise . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , had warned him . &quot;
&quot; we went up and shut up the water and shut it in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it got my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years of age , where she lived there , never had ever seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities , and he would have the only one that can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that not@@ ch had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread out quickly , because it continues heavy rain@@ falls , and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers in the vicinity of Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was significantly advanced since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rain@@ falls and roads flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ affiliated WW@@ L reported that a minor amount of 200 flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a 200 .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded now . &quot;
the ruler of the congregation of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were 72 people and seven pets allowed who were fl@@ ushed out of floods .
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to host the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of streets were closed , due to the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants for the participation , the hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems like a similar incident .
&quot; in the pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it continues on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses should be reported as flooded with Thursday , but on Friday there were no reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced &quot; by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is attached . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several gun injuries , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at his transportation to hospital at consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has made a lot , his little body was extingu@@ ished of balls , divided his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ du@@ z with the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
&quot; the boy &apos;s condition became a critical hospital in a hospital , and he had to under@@ go several operations . &quot;
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to be re@@ plen@@ ished .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people living in German@@ town .
&quot; three men were also attached , two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are al@@ igned to C@@ BS Philadelphia in the stable state .

the other two victims were not in the car and the police are determined whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that apparently he had come to a cross @-@ fire between several archers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ ics for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were re@@ tra@@ ced to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , s@@ wings the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it clearly acted on a constant battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the secret , were located . &quot;
&quot; so there were several armed fighters here , which were very active here , divided police p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia with the transmitter . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also taken in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police currently checks reports , according to surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross ra@@ cket on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I front of the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic year in the tower and that of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been around since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ists , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ in , round , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has fixed the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one was one of the female servants an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics in America and in America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible power of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , yet master@@ y Gy@@ ma@@ stic rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold for women . &quot;
Mann@@ a member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport , but can not see gy@@ ms in the whole country . &quot;
Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four tur@@ ists in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is like that Tur@@ ning is a more expensive sport and Turner will unite in the first line in private gy@@ mn@@ asium , which will arise for training , entry , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these verses , Turner receives its entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athl@@ ete since she started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired by municipalities Au@@ n numerous , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ accessible gym . &quot;
I founded my turn@@ out of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have offered free and affordable gy@@ mna@@ stics in Harlem for more than 15,000 people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained as national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) , to offer the youth high @-@ quality tower , which make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports style and benefit . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health and training and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Tur@@ ning and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team and thank you to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organize further strikes after having rejected Jeremy &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes due to a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who voted in a choice refused him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt had revealed its plans to introduce the agreement and said that the N@@ HS were in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any other delay for employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of un@@ pleasant times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ miss@@ ees for Assist@@ enz@@ arians decided last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially in particular that it will be able to deal with the current workforce of employees and to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors have dropped under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts led by the BM@@ A for the solution of disp@@ utes with discussions by the government to take part in resistance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift up the vibration and to address the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have clearly made that they are ready to perform further work fights . &quot;
&quot; the last strike in late April saw an increase of nearly 13,000 rout@@ in@@ oper@@ ations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover physicians on the stri@@ kers . &quot;
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes of the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ tim@@ o said : &quot; working struggle do not reach a little , but over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and interru@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the Com@@ par@@ ee of the assistant doctors and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively , respon@@ ding to the concerns relating to the alleg@@ ations and of course . &quot;
&quot; the employers are hop@@ ed that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as empt@@ ying , flexibility for training , training , mutual recognition of the teaching , training k@@ ins@@ ist , mutual recognition of the teaching , training , mutual recognition of the training , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

&quot; approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting fet@@ al material in the arter@@ ial walls .

&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health centres Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ro@@ red consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have substantial negative effects on the quality of life .
&quot; experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively occur in the reduction of other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people , who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to expand your treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the management bill recommends no treatment that proceeds over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness lets election flour@@ ishing in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed from office for corruption last year due to corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to that widespread election was wi@@ red in Muslim congregations as a devastating government report .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ ate@@ ways to have ignored the evidence of constitu@@ ent abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now a anti @-@ corruption sc@@ ure , said that the duty of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be permitted outside of elec@@ trol@@ ley@@ ines to protect voters outside the elec@@ torate in order to in@@ timi@@ date voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a identity with themselves , to prove their identity . &quot;
currently there must be a voters only called his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , un@@ cover the ink on the finger of a person if they leave their vote to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he urges that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of un@@ official comm@@ it@@ ees or employment groups .
&quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial crisis that began to protect , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Do@@ wning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Elect@@ oral election as the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the government mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man should be on corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign to the basis , that it may be the cor@@ related obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doub@@ tful or a consequence of a im@@ itation , one person as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be no evidence in the whole country .
he expressed himself especially al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post @-@ election - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure to people to choose one candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the conducting , to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; as proof was appropriate to vote pressure on the needy members of some ethnic minorities , in particular women and young people to choose according to the welcome of the El@@ der , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Banglad@@ es@@ ian background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had such a behavior , because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ nic@@ ism and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban to edit political activists letter writing to &quot; reap &quot; voting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May in Er@@ a , requires also harder registration checks to prevent the election directory for immigration and social @-@ recru@@ itment purposes . &quot;
&quot; consider these options , voters before choosing your identification . &quot;
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a 3 @-@ year @-@ old limitation on mot@@ ions to an automatic stamp election .
ban that political activists work full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes .
the police force the power to set aside for voting stations .
&quot; a law change , which is an accus@@ ation for ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( elementary law , 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer prohibited in voting stations .
requirement that only English is used in the voting stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff rule the rule that voters stand alone in the election cabin alone . &quot;
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal charges .
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for reasons , he was found guilty according to the high demands on the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ control@@ ls &quot; of the city regi@@ strations of the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Trial Chamber in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double viol@@ inist and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic Games in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and tape , which has proven itself as an impressive double @-@ course of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is far not the only one to combat gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time of our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists on Olymp@@ ion@@ ics , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celebr@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unters and the wolf : a member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates double @-@ course on the cycling track , many people on the Internet had to be on the Internet as a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has created a tower on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery got mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave him to hear that he had already been listening since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair@@ y , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so do I feel good as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ is@@ ons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur more in the center : the aw@@ ful simil@@ arity between the British transmission Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gy@@ mn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large and expres@@ sive eyes are supposed to go through as a double @-@ counter for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African S@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
&quot; a course higher , this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor &quot;
&quot; another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and A@@ ctor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alists in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ roasted skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans att@@ ested to the &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canadian station C@@ BC had to exc@@ use themselves after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators told that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese under@@ took care of &quot; as M@@ ief in &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was turned off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ator team of C@@ BS on board in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; I could hear : &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; excited as M@@ ief , as a pig died . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming st@@ aff@@ le 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap towards China . &quot;
viewers in all Canada re@@ acted fast online after they were sho@@ cked by the tone and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator has just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; died out of China &quot; &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not capit@@ ulate that they were still on con@@ sign@@ ment .

&quot; the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which many asked him to address &quot;
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard how our en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you only represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # attached .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC programme , was broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze to the comment on a swim performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
&quot; at the end of more than 90 times , C@@ BC asked for people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s .
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his debt to more than 90 other Twitter users who had worth reading Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments , &quot;
the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it upright , that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be aired . &quot;
we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ ze to our spectators on the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
&quot; to be one clear , Byron comments referring to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and attempted to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I made after women &apos;s floating aff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ ement , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have reli@@ ed on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not related to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard is intended and I &apos;m very sorry for me . &quot;

&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she whis@@ pered how she looked at her , she drew from and put it back into the shelf . &quot;

&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of sub@@ tro@@ users from the out@@ lay , moved their own shr@@ ubs and tro@@ users and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not try to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ eing like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; she repeated the same with three other sub@@ tro@@ users , before they finally decided that all of you liked nothing to rever@@ t and r@@ ushed out . &quot;

the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the pieces out of the sale , after she went - what is the same thing . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms strikes
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to go away with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ bers on the sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re approaching from behind , then you should turn your att@@ ack@@ ers , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go out of the line , &quot; Miz@@ ra@@ chi says . &quot;
grab the weapon between your front and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with your knees into the body and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers plu@@ cked up pain in front of pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him on the face and move backward , while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when driving from the front , the technology is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and rotate them , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , leave the weight to the gun and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle before moving back and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ fers .
&quot; but remember that it is a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est , your money is to be over@@ looked - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
travelling Ian Wright for a travel guide to his tongue on the dirty sites of Europe
a British travel with@@ drew his immune system and thro@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - having raised some of the dirty and most popul@@ ous places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and it@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ab@@ te its course on a euro notes , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a squee@@ zing in a train radio as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the end of any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and let us show what he is getting into . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw@@ cord , which was already used by thousands of others , might be completely sho@@ ck@@ able , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he stretched out , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by moving through the world , and ate wonderful things . &quot;
from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ets of toilets ; the task assigned its immune system defin@@ iti@@ vely under a sample
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; already as a kid I was relatively in@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ te water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was just going to meet his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its commission showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , L@@ umin@@ ometric numbers is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to withdraw after their L@@ umin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while fresh @-@ washed hands were less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of places in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; this comes the worst thing I smoked in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing to dirt than that !
I will not touch here because it is in@@ compatible here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer consumer really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explain the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we brought crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings that finished with that we said &quot; Let us call ourselves Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film &apos;s film , added : &quot; let it be so saying - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of things I have reli@@ ed on him , like the Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things , in which it was easier to bring Ian to join them and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we have recorded some of these dirty treats .
&quot; in a survey conducted by the survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of respondents identified Mil@@ k acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they are at least occasionally products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a non@@ oci@@ a family left their social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 , because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their estate , workers in residential community found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls are cl@@ oned up holes , carved holes , rub@@ b@@ ish were scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
&quot; the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed to now live in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment was no longer rep@@ airing . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered as beautiful as Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its call is .
&quot; the pair had three sons , who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that terror attacks had joined the family , bre@@ aches of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , drugs and excessive scre@@ ams , stre@@ ches and curse . &quot;
&quot; in June , Skel@@ don , 47 whose name stood on the lease , got a arrangement for ant@@ is@@ cation behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house which will be demolished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found . &quot;
&quot; there were tra@@ pped in the estate , where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past drugs . &quot;
neighbours spoke out that they had to fight on the streets and to be called regularly the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing di@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week for@@ cible by the estate after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntary surrender .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we can tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep today , tomorrow . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not we lived here !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was allowed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown on the out@@ fitted side of the community house .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ants have so@@ wed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family since a delay is always the last step , Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; that was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely terrible and their actions had to look terrible for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church , which have been cour@@ ageous for us and have provided us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbors , and the message is convey@@ ed that ant@@ is@@ cation behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they are all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that dropped in one of the bedroom of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
&quot; workers from the home administration will have to dig@@ est a gar@@ bage dump , which sur@@ round the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of a drug of class B in trade agreement .
she claimed that the money for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was who came in a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; after having been without the shelter , T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many rooms of the house were gra@@ fted with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will del@@ ve ten@@ ants , which are not kept in the house order &quot;
Angela Cro@@ w of the police from Devon and Corn@@ wall divided that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other r@@ enters not to keep the assignment .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they may behave differently without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour . &quot;
&quot; the police from Devon and Corn@@ wall will never be toler@@ ant and toler@@ ant behaviour , who continue to cooperate with partners to protect our congregations . &quot;
&quot; tourists in Portugal transferred in panic , after a ti@@ rail@@ ed military jet over@@ flies &quot;
sun@@ beds in Av@@ eiro in Portugal the shock of their life
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ esch@@ es P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft of the Air Force took an incredible crash flight
&quot; the Air Force showed that it was at a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment , in the sc@@ ary tourists start to panic in panic after a ti@@ rail@@ ed jet was over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost in close proximity to sun@@ beds on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers pointed out when they began to be worried about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ vest@@ ments , without having to see what caused by the clouds . &quot;
the incident occurred yesterday in Costa Nova in the vicinity of Av@@ eiro .
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ an@@ des , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers that posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down on me .
&quot; tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were placed in panic , when the plane came from the dark , and amaz@@ ingly deep flew . &quot;
&quot; today the Portuguese Air Force showed that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was found on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deep , that this is the only way to identify them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the Jet , due to the bad visibility , was slightly lower than usual , however , the air disp@@ utes insi@@ sted that safety was not at any time at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people died on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today resulted in that the pilot had to fly due to the circumstances of a strong fog and fire - so deep , what his vision were in@@ timi@@ dated . &quot;
the airplane was located on a training flight where the pilot project had to identify as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with wor@@ ries against Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - The FC Barcelona fights first step towards the first win in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup west@@ ward to the FC Sevilla , the match increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must not aband@@ on with the le@@ vy Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reg@@ aining Europe League champion , among others on Ne@@ y@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; also , Go@@ alie is missing talking to Marc @-@ Andre &apos;s ste@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the training , the German suffered a change of change in the training , giving the question at Bar@@ ca at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ alth bom@@ bers in Barcelona has been the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique did not have a clear decision until now and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er Ste@@ am left for most of the remaining applicants . &quot;
&quot; prior to the first mandatory game of the new game , there are doubt about the fitness level of the team that was hum@@ bled on Saturday at a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
at 3 : 2 at the promotional time against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. was not really convincing .
&quot; Sevilla again has to dig@@ est the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , and stre@@ wed the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with previously eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this application . &quot;
Ma Long in his own League for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; &quot; title def@@ ending &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus the World Ran@@ kings first won the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier , and Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese newspaper would catch the single @-@ title in the signs of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ le was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang was left on the plate only , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
they have withdrawn himself on the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests in fair competition alone .
&quot; I played the Mat@@ ches until now , for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I &apos;m playing for me , &quot; Z@@ hang was fol@@ ly told . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver medal winner with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; in his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma was really strug@@ gling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent . &quot;
&quot; after that , he shot down the temp@@ o on the plate and caused Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , the expected ra@@ vening match was developed . &quot;
but nevertheless we were enough to see stunning balloon change .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov had pulled a rift @-@ injury , after that , in a medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; he had to start with metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ de Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become a similar table of table @-@ old Olympia @-@ V@@ ered by the way . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ aming ″ mighty problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leaders of the U.S. Republi@@ can government is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative states for their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now weak@@ ened the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which usually large and confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns , as correspon@@ dent reported . &quot;
&quot; after he threw 16 rival within his own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , the doubt about his success in battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ icals Christians , which he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his famous media shi@@ fted again . &quot;
Republi@@ can High @-@ bur@@ ches
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June 2009 , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor from the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , according to a survey . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that are common for republi@@ can candidates . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he would stop to stop the march of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if there is back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is not doing anything else than &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it does not be rich in order for him on the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is supposed to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , one wants to increase the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress stronger among the arms . &quot;
Olympia : triple but@@ t at D@@ oping test
the IOC will set up a disciplinary commission in the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes threat@@ ens after the second d@@ oping affair in Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
&quot; after an investigation in a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee shared with a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission to establish the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village called a Ur@@ ine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was the team leading team of Ken@@ ias have been reported by D@@ oping control cabinets .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has sought for information about the case to strict research , shared a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was named in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and has issued herself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; says Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who was on the list for training checks of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan Athletics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he should have informed about cash payments of his country on upcoming D@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was supposed to have been arrested by Nairobi at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been at the IOC after numerous d@@ oping tests already since longer periods under special observation .
&quot; with the announcement of the more than 2,000 d@@ oping targets in front of the Rio Olympics , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into force . &quot;
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law passed away a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ start .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya accepted by the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight conform with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
most of the country won most medals at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; in a series of television reports , ARD has always been magni@@ fied that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there will be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IOC member Richard Po@@ und demanded a similar investigation in Kenya , as he was employed in Russian Athletics . &quot;
&quot; in this process , it could be demonstrated that in this sports field , it has been systematically d@@ oped . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salz@@ burger Fest@@ spiele presented the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic , filled with Maria &apos;s role . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra , Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under management of the Venezuel@@ an conduc@@ tors Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix to the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older Maria . &quot;
she rec@@ alls with wor@@ m@@ wood to her love with Tony while the younger Mary is playing and dances .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
&quot; first , because it is extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mari@@ as personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I made Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so she is smart , of course na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to me , my Italian character which I used as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera @-@ singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honor to work with her .
she is a very generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist , and very passionate ! &quot;
conduc@@ tors is a necessity for him .
&quot; it can be seen in any of his movements , in his look , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; both we have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ce and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today we went to the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; these are the same topics , and they are as powerful as then . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London school@@ girl who joined the IS in London was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family experienced a few weeks ago by her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that they killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ work of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family , shortly after she had allowed to leave the war and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good in it is - as a warning and warning to others that this are the risks to go into a war zone - people ever want to do this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , s@@ ult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London went to an aircraft towards Turkey and then entered into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ult@@ anas family has been informed that it was married to a ISIS fighters in Syria - and within a few months , it was a widow . &quot;

&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton will nomin@@ ate the judge Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked their confirmation since his nomin@@ ation by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is the opinion that the next president is the successor of the late judge of the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference , that he expected to choose Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of conscience . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later , that he would not speak with Clinton to nomin@@ ate Gar@@ land , and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ less@@ ness with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nomin@@ ation , Lak@@ ai@@ en and Hel@@ fer@@ workers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;

Tre@@ ats wants n@@ ay calendar for &quot; Women and for Men
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere together to deliver a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Chief Editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us this year that his n@@ ud@@ dle magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys , as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the Calendar .
&quot; we need to return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classical n@@ ud@@ eness , where both women and men feel good and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Shaw in a press release to publish the Cal@@ endars . &quot;
women will be taking part in this project because it &apos;s a wonderful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish Community calcul@@ ates mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever pra@@ ises himself and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Per@@ centage of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the presi@@ ding presi@@ ding Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard approach to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , following the coup attempt , Germany &apos;s Kurdish community is expecting a mass cur@@ s@@ cur@@ sion to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short @-@ term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand protection seek@@ ers from Turkey in the medium term , when the Erdo@@ gan regime change the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k in the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already passed Kurdish high@@ s with pen@@ alties before months , 500,000 Kurds are in Turkey on the run . &quot;
&quot; following the p@@ utsch of the p@@ utsch , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks are added . &quot;
many will restart in Europe when they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even refugees produce refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Board of Directors lam@@ ented the deliber@@ ations of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ical cities . &quot;
so that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the departure day to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wi@@ ped out in the past hundred years or sold , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
the Chief of Staff demanded that the Federal Government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters .
there is also a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics in Germany .
&quot; for the first time , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition . &quot;
fire mark@@ er as Gü@@ len followers destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics of professional existence .
&quot; whoever pra@@ ises himself and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , by the way the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper under appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks occupied the largest group of asylum in Germany because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; at the date of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all have recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there are no lack of war , poverty or pl@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are only politically , so by state @-@ government , individual persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it we@@ aving &quot;
&quot; Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing of the summer election campaign , and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the country &apos;s Day . &quot;
they have understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; in 2021 , the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; as far as so far , it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and landing battle - that is enclosed . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ als , who are to be convinced by the elections , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers that are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a loc@@ als , so do not choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers to distribute posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and the end of the vote only tired . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave once more campaign than the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if one can tell at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , which has been strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU . &quot;
&quot; exciting is , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the land , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , as well as his legendary man &apos;s predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet , and there is a ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ ish Merkel on the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the African . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; We create &quot; &quot; the ascent of the pop@@ uli@@ sts lists , what is probably going to cost him today . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with their top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if one is at the right time at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she also invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Merkel is invited in the Nor@@ theast by Merkel .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Mecklenburg and Mecklenburg . &quot;
&quot; since it was probably the majority of other federal states , Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it too bad not to listen to the other corners of Germany once again Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU deteri@@ orated largely on the usual election campaign in market places and in front of shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; thus , co@@ ca@@ des , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that , on the land the basis is the base that she must be very strict , again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are talking about it like the left , SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely there in the time of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU electoral fighting is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go where it we@@ aves , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , the S &amp; D Euro MPs last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD clearly won 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will be able to create the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they are making a modern virtu@@ e from holiday emergency and put great campaigns on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it calls the state of Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green sel@@ ection@@ ers take care of track c@@ ens@@ orship according to local stimul@@ ants among the holiday hosts .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ di@@ lem@@ ons , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even more beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; voting holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : Gast@@ on@@ gs suffer from Sper@@ m
&quot; at the speed of speed , with which the B is smooth , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for the persons responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all@@ u@@ ber@@ ed praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite different , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the building site could be moved to the south for the half @-@ time to the south , until the end of October , everything will be finished . &quot;
&quot; be praised , also the opposite number of persons responsible for the construction work , about when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ n@@ fs@@ cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday to the south , and also the lock of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and , thereby , the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been relaxed and relaxed in the place . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again .
the ev@@ ic@@ ation traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partially significant complaints , &quot; says the company responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment , Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the local inhabitants of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Batt@@ les sought for themselves and rather confi@@ dential as the signs . &quot;
&quot; in this way , what led to man@@ cher trucks in residential areas . &quot;
&quot; as the speed lim@@ it@@ ments were not kept , the congregation demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable convic@@ tions , &quot; says King that made himself a spot on the spot . &quot;
two to three had been lit@@ tered for two to three per minute .
the fastest one was on the speed of 77 km / km in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site continued , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for business people at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the road is open again . &quot;
&quot; in the cards , business@@ men don &apos;t like to look . &quot;
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led in sales with them , everyone who asks you can see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; final customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the renovation has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; also in Mai@@ er &apos;s deal@@ ership by Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also an assumption that of course . &quot;
most of the breeds are the local ones along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words . &quot;
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only it but all the guest facilities have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; people from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil failed . &quot;
we have to be glad about each euro .
the recorded sales were reduced to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the street prepar@@ es its operation &quot; two years back . &quot;
&quot; half of his employees , he must be released . &quot;
&quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have been re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial balance , prof@@ essing the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it also has dis@@ advantages to carry out through the restoration . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where there was something more generous . &quot;
&quot; with all no@@ ises , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; to understand that other family guests can now understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic control , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you are not able to drive , it is also different . &quot;
&quot; according to the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the greatest crisis which has experienced its host in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of work , this is brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of the terrorist control at laws .
&quot; following the recent attacks , the Minister of Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now puts a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a lack of terror to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals are politically un@@ ut@@ ably , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Finance in the presentation of his new security team . &quot;
they are not asking anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also participated in it .
&quot; as the interior minister , however , it is located on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère left a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
&quot; but these are the more extensive , but the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , pro@@ found@@ ational : that a new security authority to take care of the un@@ lock communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements on air traffic data and arms .
the call after more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities are not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère k@@ icks off a second sign for proposals that were previously un@@ willing to do with the SPD : he wants to pull sympath@@ y for terrorist groups under a penalty and pull out jihadists with double @-@ citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these are difficult points for the SPD , &quot; dre@@ aming the CDU man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he will hold this anyway for reasonable and demanding nothing , which had no chances in the coalition partner . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
this is partly in itself : he plans fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention from people prior to deportation .
refugees who are targeted specifically into the country are to check out their smartphone in advance and open social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; at Dul@@ ces for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some worse than date - approximately such as perpet@@ rators , or their papers to be aware of their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
some even works un@@ balanced and lets questions openly .
&quot; and with some points - in the ine@@ treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ ls , for example - the question arises : what does it mean to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be addressed , that the ass@@ ess@@ ors of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about the high refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that have been deeply involved , they let not go out in electoral events . &quot;
inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the assurance is great .
&quot; and yes , they are fighting . &quot;
&quot; union and SPD rise increasingly in terms of inner safety , therefore increasingly in position . &quot;
in recent days it went up between both parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ dener dispute over the facilities of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Unions @-@ interior minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also working here to reconc@@ ile tones .
&quot; from a return of the double pass , he will hold nothing . &quot;
we satisfy the discussion in Germany .
&quot; you restart , don &apos;t be useful . &quot;
and in a Bur@@ ka prohibition he denied constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional , and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be still present . &quot;
there is quite a lot to worry about dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD are currently attemp@@ ting to pro@@ claim internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals first of a talk of conversation and says , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security of the safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming by Volkswagen .
&quot; despite diesel , the pay@@ roll is increasing worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets there is around .
in the feedback action there is a concept .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries into the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest motor@@ cyclists can continue to show an increase in the previous year despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW , especially in Western Europe , weak@@ ened the overall sales , such as the company noted in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW , in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth . &quot;
&quot; brand ambassador Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , it has been given to a sale process in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was bur@@ dened by the EU in order to explain a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the exhaust gas was first escal@@ ated , is also still a Min@@ us to be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is continuing further by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extradition minus from 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to show a further sales team from January to July . &quot;
&quot; in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles supplied vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software audience .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after conversion of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car driver set the customer after conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , &quot; but not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company &apos;s headquarters . &quot;
reason are legal entities .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; reports , Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed on Monday VW @-@ representatives in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday .
the traffic ministry has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has adopted the editions of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA , to fulfil its enti@@ re@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; stated General Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the change@@ over there are no deteri@@ or@@ ations , and all of the approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business circuits . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen is the possibility that customers will come back half a year after the change@@ over with a car damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the harm has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damages , that will not do anything with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ scandal to have an un@@ locking regarding possible warranty , as it was . &quot;
therefore de VW is using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich spar@@ ks in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It &apos;s only about 139 customers who par@@ ked 40 million euros on poison or day money . &quot;
the German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal savings must not be afraid to pay for their austerity .
&quot; if money transfer money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on poison or day money . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; it has been 40 million euros for a day , which could be raised from one day on the other , and he could not toler@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; these are within me at the central bank account and account for 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I cannot put 4000 Euros for each million . &quot;
he now give the cost after the urs@@ or principle .
&quot; cash is easy to let in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t even want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the officer . &quot;
most clients have understanding and changes to other angi@@ ble assets .
only few emigrated to other banks .
the Bayern federation declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is caused by all banks significant costs . &quot;
&quot; you alone bear to wear , &quot; &quot; business cycle is not possible permanently . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made headlines from the Al@@ ten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , the main managing director of the Bank , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay attention to deposits in Germany , this competition is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cli@@ pper that is rich in wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can be a small bank for a small bank , if it is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is currently no further banks known for the cooperative Association of Bavaria , which calcul@@ ates a replacement for deposits of private customers , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of the German National Ban@@ ks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Ban@@ ks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to be negative at the end of June , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was hard , and it threatening the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
dist@@ ination sheets : who is buying records actually ?
lon@@ ely men in middle ages love plates .
&quot; before you have a comment on the p@@ seudonym , to over@@ look at him under the p@@ seudonym &quot; non @-@ Al@@ le@@ vy &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement will lead from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multiple sound of sound boards do not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that will welcome the ability of physical objects , but due to a mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who have bought a record recently , are all predi@@ ction after the age between 45 and 54 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely cult group . &quot;
&quot; it is also not a hor@@ des through hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older platform managers retain their emotions rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog would be a message report on television , I would follow the camera while I stand in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o run , a modest grey suit , and I stand wild , my hands hold and somewhat determin@@ ative : &quot; so , let us take a look at . &quot;
so let &apos;s throw a look at .
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sales were resident - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera to be able to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I was by Sister Ray ( data count : two young women , three men middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector ? I wonder ?
&quot; I guess it already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this record boards , pictured above ( he has sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed at home ) , clothed the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he had been released and again to buy objects he sold , when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 1960s , early 70s that appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to be too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who want to buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I smoke not , and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who works by Sister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets it on You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also not@@ ices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; of the conversations that I have led , people usually have ent@@ ailed their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs , to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to a specific age of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica to realize that record shops offering a cal@@ ming community of equi@@ p@@ inn@@ s .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans will feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to withdraw stability of familiar record sites , from objects that watch happy youth centres . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void , or ownership of material owners than a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is with me as collectors and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal wrong .
&quot; we are like her social worker ! &quot; fl@@ ashes a staff of a turn@@ out stack .
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard it yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I bl@@ azing at Bos@@ sa Nova compilation .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone recently arrived here and said : &quot; I own not a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio head record in order to put it into the shelf . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ous . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who come first slowly . &quot;
&quot; opp , which has the record of records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ low@@ ly audience when I go cleaning . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ age@@ j@@ ungs and women middle aged . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is slightly relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ tet pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity in the customer .
&quot; none of them looks funny , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are badly det@@ ectable if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of records for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a sho@@ vel bum@@ ble@@ bee than a large purchase .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so the collecting records are not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loved si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record lovers should be inspired by Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the certificate that Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ pants I observe a group of young teenage girls who are interested in a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cro@@ sley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left you find a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at her , perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to address them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; turn@@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , which exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en exist . &quot;
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble@@ bee through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they master the stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ish , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who towers over the shoulders of the middle @-@ aged men . &quot;
&quot; Green@@ land@@ hai , the longest living verteb@@ rates - video clip &quot;
schol@@ ar that Grön@@ land@@ hai has the longest life span of all verteb@@ rates on the planet .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen , who studied shar@@ ks , says that the record was gone by a female , from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long . &quot;
French court leans on demol@@ ition from shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be allowed to sell 72 temporary shops within the camp of goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , selling hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euro in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would have been a parallel business that would not be paid out of which a fire and san@@ ity risk .

&quot; moreover , they led out that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate 72 pro@@ vis@@ as business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; could be completely tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser have to set up the next generation speed tests : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash tools are tested , and the temp@@ pos@@ ers are to be carried out especially effectively . &quot;
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used as an example of accident focal points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
&quot; for example , at motorway construction sites , or to rehabil@@ itate bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary bl@@ itter for compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complex .
En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted knives and the case data are encrypted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be cap@@ tive at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments as well as drive @-@ travel to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ driven condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturers with a trailer cl@@ utch . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it is not easy to che@@ w , it is lowered by the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ ten and also disappear in the safe outside shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 units last year . &quot;
&quot; great Britain covering silver in 7 @-@ star ru@@ g@@ by , after reaching the Master@@ class Gold . &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ aths Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji divided a master class in handling , Side @-@ step@@ ping , after@@ math , line run and raw force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was sunk by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to her in the final . &quot;
&quot; however , in this form , Fiji had been defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team . &quot;
&quot; it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not be - that at least a gold medal for his neck is hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief coach Ben Ryan , the former chief for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game with Ryan Sev@@ ens . &quot;
they only lost one here .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji began wonderful and dismissed the attacks of GB@@ S .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . at , when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , than O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au near the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i still added another attack from the right corner he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly have reached the ball .
&quot; a tigh@@ tly clu@@ sion of Mitchell stopped the Mount of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third gate to achieve , but it is only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner got a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new time since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ p@@ orted by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , when Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB was still over . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led the basic changes to the half @-@ time and ended the fic@@ ji@@ an gap ... for the whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the South se@@ sul@@ aner , whose fans sang and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to see the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ dot dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff sounds that Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB destroyed in the lawn .
&quot; earlier in the days , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Britain pressing a close @-@ fin@@ er match of the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton crossed the line with an impressive foot and scored a gateway to the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant delay of tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the train@@ ers for rowing win
&quot; there will be no more powerful gold than with these games , and that will mean something . &quot;
&quot; from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 harsh H@@ ie@@ ve , who was in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their gol@@ den@@ a moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the appl@@ au@@ ds that were at the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the ech@@ o of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ am@@ pered as they were invited to the second Olympic champion in the two without control woman in the history of British Sports which made such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all of its 3@@ 9.@@ 7 finish , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es that reflects on the surface with the elegance of tails , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on can contribute to the in@@ different progress that make the difference and no one was more helpful as the trainer that would survive this day at all , as he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , oper@@ able and doing it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin the interru@@ ption of a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing to itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ fertility of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a annoying morning to talk a little more than otherwise , trying to handle his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in an effort in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would have no one , therefore , a massive thank you . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I would have no better person to train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
&quot; the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams come from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to sit down .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not to make something great . &quot;
&quot; today we wanted no fireworks , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race which we did . &quot;
&quot; for one year , the pair will take a break before making decisions on its future . &quot;
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding with her own TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve back@@ rever@@ es .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to gr@@ asp that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity of clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ eins Group &quot; , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is considered as &quot; Bavarian &quot; . &quot;
a small fr@@ ying pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association as a model for the great water producer .
it was named after some time in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken signed the Pur@@ pose association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group was &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exempl@@ ary .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ band members , was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes some 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member states are the congregations of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach . &quot;
there are water suppliers for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller had been appointed as water att@@ ain@@ ers in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Pur@@ itan Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and maintenance work , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency number on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the new fountain of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the rehabilitation of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the reconstruction of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stag@@ nation , and I have always recorded innovations , because water is de@@ structive and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her foli@@ age , they praised G@@ öl@@ itz faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used himself with a lot of heart bl@@ oss@@ oms for its water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he has allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ eins Group to nit@@ rate Administr@@ ative Research Forum in front of the Administr@@ ative Research Forum . &quot;
he received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s hand praised water att@@ endant Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together for 28 years with him .
he is the best water att@@ endant and he was a faithful dum@@ b .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his perspective , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the break @-@ in at the high container of Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; at minus 17 degrees the whole night , so the villages have to be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; once again the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only keep up , because one filled the container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ abs . &quot;
the management of the pot@@ able water association has been handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer who will follow the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was shot in a multi @-@ family home on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; the man himself called himself with us and given to have shot his life in his life , &quot; said a police leader . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators will be on the run after him openly .
&quot; meanwhile , nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown and has a glass . &quot;
meanwhile the police has released a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still bear the weapon for themselves , so the police . &quot;
&quot; he who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a T@@ öt@@ t@@ deli@@ mit . &quot;
&quot; we do not say more , &quot; said a police leader in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness , a Special Representative ando ( SEK ) was found at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - lighting review for German steel industry
the cra@@ cked and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional cost in million@@ aires .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from the green electricity funding are from the table .
&quot; during the liberation of the renewable energy revolution , the Federal Foreign Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the German Economy Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in the German Steel Industries &apos; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we finally could finally arrive after two years of negotiations .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission therefore planned to put the steel producers to use gases from the furnace for power generation for their own consumption , to the checkout . &quot;
the steel industry was threatened by the German industry associations additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ : there is now a fundamental certificate with the EU Commission on talks with competition un@@ miss@@ al Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only if the generators in the steel works will be replaced , an EEG le@@ ak will fall by 20 percent . &quot;
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall had welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission on the own production .
&quot; thus , the status Quo of the current legislation will be largely fixed . &quot;
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel , future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; further , you have to follow . &quot;
IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt on the reform of the emission standards .
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied than the world &apos;s largest producer in China , due to the weak@@ ening domestic demand , cast steel to the global market . &quot;
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel concer@@ to price d@@ umping .
&quot; during this spring , the situation has something relaxed . &quot;
&quot; for example , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ etus effect , to others have opened economic outlook in China . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , as sustain@@ ably the price over@@ h@@ aul is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remains c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
&quot; last@@ ly , the prices were stag@@ n@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to exclu@@ de last even closure of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced over 3,4 million tonnes by a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , like the steel association of steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the amount returned to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association is calculated in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing , Senior Citi@@ zens &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the course of studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , merry , and all live , says she . &quot;
&quot; besides , she does something good in her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is equal from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , also tells Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League . &quot;
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music and describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; by regular mer@@ ging , seniors may link social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; for often social and family structures aged over , one choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organize , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of compositions . &quot;
singing can be st@@ res@@ s@@ ful in the positive sense . H@@ ac@@ kler means .
&quot; for doing so , seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who demands his lungs are not so fast in everyday life as quickly as the pu@@ rest .
&quot; even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German labor community of seniors @-@ organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs are w@@ akes up with older people many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , people de@@ file himself de@@ stru@@ cted people to long covered events . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the head becomes a special achievement in singing with the head . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentr@@ ating on their own voice and on a given rhythm , and to adapt the other singers - that is a great cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people living alone , do not practice themselves to focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self este@@ em is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show itself : if I wait for something for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - that experience boo@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , shouldn &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks , little talent . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing it alone - with 50 sin@@ ess people who hears , if a sound goes on beside it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , senior citizens have various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sing someone from the old circle in a veter@@ an ench@@ y@@ ma you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views on cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can contact us directly to the church or the church . &quot;
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbors to ask help at the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should certainly be connected to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats respond more sensitive than cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of young animals
&quot; in Hanover , Bi@@ ologists have examined how the effect of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals did . &quot;
&quot; at their surprise , the males also didn &apos;t che@@ w cold - however , they stopped at the difference to the females always . &quot;
female cats may recognize the age level of cat bab@@ ys on the mi@@ ths of little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster on foli@@ age of k@@ itt@@ ens who think of great need , such as scientists from the School of Medical School and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater also react to the k@@ itt@@ ens of K@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ xes of less and heavily ra@@ ining young for the males either cannot perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wie@@ b@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already revealed that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams were different with the pressures of their help . &quot;
a total of nine adult K@@ ater and eight guards were observed from the veter@@ in@@ arian of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a herd of little ones , which were separated for three minutes from the litter box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger tum@@ ours , which were also lifted up . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the small sample for sa@@ un@@ for@@ cible .
&quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , responded differenti@@ ated on the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they swi@@ vel faster to the speakers when this ru@@ e played the very busy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability might possibly be born or developed using the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males responded even at all , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time , in Turkey a major football match will be held in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ al between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already with the suspension of the emergency , after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ ality should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected to include the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the p@@ utsch attempt . &quot;
it is not even made before the football .
the public prosecutor requested an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
&quot; accordingly , he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group in the South America . &quot;
the Southern R@@ uler of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len shall be responsible for the p@@ utsch of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len .
&quot; this is true for 90 days . in fact , this is valid for 90 days . in fact , the life of most Turks , however , has no impact on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places in the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday , Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into supporters and ad@@ versaries of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are not counted among the friends of the President .
&quot; however , in view of dramatic experiences in the history , the strict de@@ jection of military co@@ aches . &quot;
even the fans themselves agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al winner &quot; Gala &quot; it will be returned to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
&quot; its sporty value set the doors in the past season below proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first game as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; won him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the trop@@ hy .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , the dis@@ appointing season for the record champion found a reconc@@ iled conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; came out early in the Europe League . &quot;
in the South Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who scored 26 season with 26 season covers the base to the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return on the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , at AC Florence , following the signing of the Treaty of AC , Gom@@ ez was announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; he cited the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storms would have to be willing to aband@@ on around one third of his to € 7.5 million an annual sal@@ ari@@ d , it is clear : &quot; his salary at Florence can not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite d@@ oping : these athletes have medals @-@ opportunities at Olympia in Rio , Germany &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others survived athle@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh - they &apos;re fighting in Rio by medals .
the topic D@@ oping is intended for the headlines in Rio Olympics Games .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping lock , had a short start before the games , was kicked off at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
it was a quir@@ ky scene : with a set smile she was still stum@@ bled into the hall and prov@@ oked her gig with her gig .
&quot; as determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ one . &quot;
but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who take the start in the Rio Olympics despite d@@ oping @-@ past .
here is an overview :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he has been locked two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since then , the Olympic champion from 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , it is over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest challenge of Us@@ ers Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world championship in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month sper@@ re after taking the pain using Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had strong dental pain after surgery , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship has been tested positive for the prohibited stim@@ ulate means of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic carried out the ignor@@ ance and was imprisoned for six months .
the four most advanced lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and bi @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive and was closed for 21 months . &quot;
a mean to penis enlargement was responsible for getting drunk Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete have been recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 due to testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; due to a verdict of the 2008 Olympic Games , bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille received the CA@@ S International Tribunal for the 2008 Olympic Games . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he lies on rank two of the world ranking list .
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record woman and gold fav@@ it@@ in was not tested until May , but may still be able to start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement was found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ inist - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday early . &quot;
&quot; they suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this . &quot;
her home trip is scheduled for early September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also are also un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in general contact with the local authorities , so pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; at some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police a Thai change was killed and approximately 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Icel@@ anders and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday early then , two explo@@ sives went up , and according to the authorities , another person was killed . &quot;
Ph@@ uk@@ et was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
a taxi driver has been injured during the det@@ onation of the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police in front of the territory . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on at the south @-@ east coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army de@@ eral Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early before journalists . &quot;
we estimate that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves - probably , however , it is the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern with the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of mus@@ li@@ que@@ fied separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; during the past few days , the authorities have received secret services to im@@ min@@ ate attacks in the south of the country - but they haven &apos;t been informed about the exact date and the places . &quot;
it is still un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed out their officers in the country , security around the main government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment venues . &quot;
&quot; there are still smaller bomb attacks in Thailand , but they usually do not pay for tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to reason of reason bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able on his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ den and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , non @-@ necessary trips in these provinces are sp@@ ared . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution by the military jun@@ ta .
this dre@@ aming the military &apos;s major influence in the years coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs have been an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , keeps himself very good to have the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting the control of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed . &quot;
&quot; just one year ago in Bangkok , at a attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack on the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is listed in the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection .
&quot; according to multiple offices , the Constitutional Court also submitted the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; demands for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate at the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , migrants are diff@@ used in the Middle East or in the Middle East . &quot;
therefore we observe the move too .
&quot; the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their identity by foreign identity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; voting rights in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ as said , his authority pleased themselves closely with the country &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities &apos; try to get their target audience , where she stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts , they speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the same Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advert@@ ised public@@ ity for their own cause .
propaganda is supposed to speak emot@@ ionally .
young people are there in a special way .
this is dangerous .
recently it had given reports of several federal states concerning contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to be African politicians .
&quot; Ma@@ as said , he did not have any findings . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts this type will only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes their target and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so decisive is whether such persons have an influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a look at the significant increase in criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right to terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we found in recent years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it may well be that further rights @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ ves . &quot;
but that is not recogni@@ zable in German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism .
the groups are based on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; do not worry about it , that many over@@ handles on the account of people went , who did not appear in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ect of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed atro@@ cities that had previously agreed with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or left , who have been radic@@ alised with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ stic mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is granted to the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s summer season .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the s@@ ligh@@ ten s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures . &quot;
he just disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te has subsequently been to the viral inter@@ ne@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends with a return of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather not a sporting figure , which attracted the attention of international media attention . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international pool .
this is distributed to do swimming in sub @-@ presented countries .
&quot; as in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia , most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name took the round .
some media looked at him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the whale . &quot;
in the re@@ jection of a &quot; welfare state &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; made it fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; on him .
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , played there . &quot;
compar@@ is@@ ons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took attention to media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the performance of the swim out of Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old had learned to swim for eight months before the Olympics and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the threatening electoral situation not so narrow
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks on a election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should it be done with the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
then he ride in the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be quite no matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will be either fl@@ ashing , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not be rich in order for him on the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; thus , he described the US president Barack Obama and the can@@ did@@ acy of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , finally , more resistance formally formed . &quot;

Gf@@ K @-@ Leadership joins the dis@@ appointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K re@@ ins his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ rest appeared suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K proved that the chair of Chief of Staff Matthias Hart@@ mann will continue to remain uncertain , the longer the success of his promised successes . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management stands the worldwide number Five of the industry in front of a person@@ alised new beginning .

&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ many , it was last Friday , at the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of which continued to lead the continued successes of years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; given the last time of bad Gf@@ K business figures , each inc@@ in@@ ward appearance will eventually be in@@ quiet . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the quota so , &quot; it was . &quot;
&quot; according to the attacks in the preceding quarter , the company will not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half @-@ year sales , turnover of 72@@ 1.2 million euros was 3.4 per cent . &quot;

&quot; two of the passengers suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to turn their data to the opposite L@@ aster , which drove back on the road . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road , and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; because of the location of the bus , the persons couldn &apos;t leave the bus , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six lif@@ esp@@ ace and an ambul@@ ances came to the accident on the state highway 2 .
the last traveler were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ heard district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
&quot; there , you should wait for a spare bus of the travel company . &quot;
investig@@ ators demanded the drivers of the drivers and possible witnesses to report on the police .

the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as an administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new calcul@@ ating of the fees for se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , survivors from the previous cal@@ ming period are also equal . &quot;
&quot; with all three basic san@@ itation systems , Schmidt thus founded the gra@@ ding increases by relatively small se@@ wage systems that fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters each year . &quot;
&quot; due to its low distribution basis , the basis for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be gra@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wage water is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ alled cal@@ cul@@ ation period in all three systems not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair applications in a substantial scope . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt showed that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged for the mechanical ventilation system due to a loss of damage .
&quot; in the pump box , the nearly 20 years old funding from the ground had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first se@@ wage plant had to be installed , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge had to be installed in order to comply with the water requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res came to these extraordinary expenditure and maintenance costs which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 remained significantly below the current level . &quot;
Stein@@ houses made clear that with low san@@ itation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully carried out .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt added the market leader of major entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plant in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain on tour of stone buildings , especially as one could not expand the supply of the se@@ wer@@ age of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ hal@@ al to expand this facilities , because it is de@@ fic@@ tional facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria ranks for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria is 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero has been posted since October 2012 as a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average rating of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
&quot; the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % , and the annual inflation compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods are observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1,2 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained on alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication , as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; Effect as Asian cartoon
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e insp@@ ires is , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel across races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat to change about 150 million daily users to change reality and borders with ident@@ ities at such a way that borders already . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are dis@@ concer@@ ted , specially designed tools that generate more than 30 million wei@@ ght@@ ens per day . &quot;
all Mis@@ sions go to the public .
&quot; Snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past criticism in which they were accused , that the app would prop@@ agate Black@@ face , or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some Us@@ ers proposed a filter , who gave them sle@@ dge , false teeth and abandoned che@@ eks , they called some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yel@@ low@@ ns &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked , if this repeated contro@@ versy was referred to a bigger problem , that the company has diver@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously with diversity . &quot;
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat comm@@ ended that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was an homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but outside , the rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , remin@@ ded the filter to viol@@ ate c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student student , has been widely distributed over the photos that the filter has viol@@ ently viol@@ ate and to be un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; she added that , &quot; it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not joint @-@ secured , but that the yel@@ low@@ ns dra@@ gged into the extreme extre@@ mes . &quot;
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural spectac@@ le .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in a endless diversi@@ fication and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we are all holding in the hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are in things breed di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponent - could rather be expected to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filtering is a picture of snap@@ shot , &quot; so it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed when it was before the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided that it works as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Snap@@ chat accounts for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that she may believe that racial const@@ ants may reflect a lack of diver@@ ity at the contra@@ cting practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white but male leadership and finished their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ Ter@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions they are safe or feel good to say what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diver@@ ity of its workforce and points to its status as private companies .
&quot; on Thursday , snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently focused a personnel responsible that focused on sub@@ contra@@ cted population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said to her , &quot; &quot; I wonder their Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership , ISIS intelligence service , represents the Congress of Congress &quot;
&quot; under the United States Central Command ( United States ) military service at the United States Central Command in order to draw a optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it permits the actual states of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of Armed Forces , Intelligence and Armed Conf@@ lic@@ ites , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , reported how to change their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida to control the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; News Intelligence Information , which were typically dered by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ ers typically , signed a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it permits the actual states of the site and were consistent with more than analyses of other news services , cited a newspaper article published . &quot;
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses presented our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistake in the Cent@@ Com are enough up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; even though there are no direct references to them that government pointed out under Obama , it shows how analysts at the pressure of their pre@@ laws have been exposed , a optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly positive as it corresponds to the facts &quot; presented the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com for example announced that a military withdrawal of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , this is much clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Defence from Kansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the following report to re@@ play the risk by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after them , analysts were worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic members of the Intelligence Agency published its own findings on Thursday , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com established a highly restricted case for the creation of subsequent en@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments for Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; the High@@ est Democr@@ at in Com@@ par@@ ee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. ship , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent report reports , &quot; the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave excessive space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave , no indications to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts on a certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General Inspec@@ torate , which were recorded according to Cent@@ Com analysis . &quot;
&quot; . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not report reports of Congress during the investigation of the general practition@@ er . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and defense ministry welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics in the national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air@@ campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , have dropped to the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for an honest ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the salary information concerning the Islamic State recall the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com ruled against George W. Bush to meet the recommendations of many analysts at the time of many analysts at the time of many analysts on the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in revol@@ t against the present coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team asked Mr. Hoo@@ ker following the government &apos;s statement that contrary to the statements of the government of the refin@@ eries , no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group had not taken significant impacts on the financial situation of the terrorist group because these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ a commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative Assembly because of its superior positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the USA will win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey field of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever had done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , it knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition , and are still in their group with the British on the first place , which remains unbe@@ aten in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will hit the first round on Saturday in the last game .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; the first placed will go to the strong Dutch , somewhat longer out of the way , which lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; like always the game on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games in the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because they did not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better for better . &quot;
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have able to plu@@ ck the ru@@ der completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a return from the s@@ uture . &quot;
India was without victory in the tournament in the game but the team showed up surprisingly and held the game level of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
&quot; it led a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball in the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gateway in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good is on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , too late as it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inev@@ itable , a runner @-@ up between competition and stre@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; it is , when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning staff , which is to protect from the wrist@@ bands to the Turner for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can not set the TV set , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the maintenance long in coffee shop , without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there &apos;s still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could have been sent among these known names , which would have been sent to Prime Time , that if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for the Olympic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
&quot; further from the centre , some in the shade are sports , which are not univers@@ ally recognized : aerial view , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and let it reign for long .
&quot; but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so rare that many people questioned I had asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympic port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; even though the United States sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it up to the final wound . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men , the Chinese , and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women . &quot;
&quot; Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada , defend their gold medal in London this year . &quot;
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jumping has a certain external player , partly because it sounds for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only one enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ ors of his never to end - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ ens and Tau@@ ber , the two sports which are essentially combined . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means that much means like &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a range of falling movements ( turning , h@@ amm@@ ing and sage ) before they landing at the feet . &quot;
you will be evaluated according to official Olympic program according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts hop@@ ed in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes and back , down and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; you do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also in the TV transfer also another height : the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the targeted Stre@@ ets is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir up even a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I feel like to watch this games as something tired .
&quot; including the trampoline , the trampoline offers a breath . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ier is above .
a demonstration movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she pr@@ ams , seem@@ ingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , then go down , then down@@ wards again . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal of no expan@@ se in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as competing with the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final dogs will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will show the final steps as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympic mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked at the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by the Ang@@ us and the objec@@ tivity of male athletes , according to the The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his new fan base to Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the United States &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that many protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in Sch@@ wal@@ let .
is Ethiopia just doing it together ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid board with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government and expanded steadily in more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was in@@ hib@@ ited according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were fired by armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , some of the protests , who are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security personnel are armed with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to summar@@ ise this country and in future it will even be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services closely cooperate with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror into the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new coup in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continued the repression of repression of the opposition - the opposition in the country has been restricted to their silence .
&quot; many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and those no other options have to protest apart , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous symptoms that cover everything from ground use to the sausages in regards to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the ten@@ sions continue along the border with Erit@@ rea . a battle for this cont@@ enti@@ ous , controversial line caused hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front , who were forced out more or less forced on the past few years , could be armed and armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the dec@@ eit@@ ure after years ago are now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved its internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government locked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , above all in protests , so many people can still communicate on Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , they hide where they may stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were gathered to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
&quot; since apples prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and the economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in fla@@ x areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population , who are dominant in the military , in commerce and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ sealed illness in the years 2012 for 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly dist@@ anced in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use custom assigned to make ad@@ versaries and to make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing in this fundament@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ c@@ auti@@ ous reasons to capture the position of Lord Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am came from the south , when Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many feared that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government , which apparently dra@@ gged out by the government and then stolen from the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ ors , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts in Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ mont , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty . &quot;
&quot; but apparently , this has not prevented the intention of the internal abuse of Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot;
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , Protest@@ ants in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , led by tig@@ ray @-@ managed shops and hatred against the tig@@ ray in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests and other Western allies have a unique position .
&quot; the American government , Ethiopia used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ades on the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently noted that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to coinci@@ de in a volatile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin free hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his claim Obama was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the final contro@@ versy over Friday that en@@ forced his campaign by attack that his repeatedly repe@@ aled his claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; these clari@@ fication the new questions concerning communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its fel@@ low@@ men , who stri@@ ve to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the actual position to explain which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating in a campaign events on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the claim on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpre@@ t it , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in a morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; as opposed to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative et@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism went down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand for the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es for economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton had suggestions for higher taxes and that he had bo@@ red their speech bo@@ red . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ kas@@ m into his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he moved strong criticism of himself when he meant that Russians should chop Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later , &quot; Natur@@ ally , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one lingu@@ istic limits to politics and then return according to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then they may be clear ... &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his testimony enough , so they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted a still estim@@ ation of their sound as its res@@ ent@@ eous figures declined . &quot;
&quot; a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attemp@@ ting to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he is accused of understanding his critics or in@@ correct his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he has intensi@@ fied attention in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sciss@@ ors have brought his loyal co @-@ dispute to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ oking his testimony . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said thus to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ bo@@ asting , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government was under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister , it allowed ISIS to spread themselves to the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them before , on each of his words and to be pre@@ set against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ies over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologies than just another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once pushed over the market at the price of the market comes back in Green@@ point
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which was not a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices of its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie business , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people benef@@ ited as the last loss in one of the gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a silk business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , it is also new re@@ inv@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ year employee of old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafés . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer urged him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions .
there are natural bowls .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , so there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ oned stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave herself a while for the coffee and she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was in the coffee and culture in the ver@@ b which was right in me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; again they drink coffee , even if they ordered that day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably dim .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , eggs and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said he did not expect Gro@@ ll that the soap business was taken to the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has indeed to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee bars . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the pan@@ ni@@ an to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , so that he decided to make them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighbouring building .
a new delay is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café was closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt had said that the location of the Lok@@ as and the best a new coffee felt like a return . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a host@@ ility , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ thful for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Jo@@ in soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as a dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with spar@@ ks people , &quot; &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA during Z@@ iegel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side .
&quot; their newest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Polar enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , be@@ bo@@ red snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh salad with olive trees , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable soup . &quot;
&quot; when the reporter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that the ingredient .
&quot; imagine , so many peanuts eat that they serve them as dinner . &quot;
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ves for male Fel@@ low , and it was served freshly baked past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the paths to the country with which the country went to country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans was a central , split theme , &quot; gi@@ fted co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ed food : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and k@@ ett@@ ollen have been pri@@ med up to the basic food , the k@@ ett@@ olle as a wonderful kind , food remains re@@ plac@@ eable , &quot; &quot; noticed Z@@ iegel@@ man , since Kö@@ che un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients could hide in a cre@@ ole sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by billi@@ ard dried fruit .
&quot; meat , for years of the center of the American kitchen , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange bl@@ ends were tried out , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction was preferred before taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book that includes recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a dish of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , the household farm - including Louise Stanley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; published by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ol@@ iti@@ an &quot; &quot; and the challenge to turn p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ m@@ ge sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical d@@ ain@@ ties .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s answer to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ stance . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farms in his kitchen , he sp@@ ans like the million@@ th heavy man of world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; he ate in an almost gilded dining room , and wore a smo@@ king . &quot;
he was very realistic to a strange .
&quot; President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same error if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ u@@ ct him with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the current owner of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was rejected , once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; due to our continued focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food . &quot;
the pair gave to understand the book the eating habits of Z@@ iegel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law better - for example how food could not throw away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man remembered , &quot; They really did get ill . &quot;
there was the wind bo@@ omer@@ ang .
&quot; after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt to lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that there was a common trick to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no proposed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone really di@@ pped a spoon into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E won three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
the hero was killed at bombs &apos;s attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bomb attack against the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group that had saved the life of almost 60,000 people so far . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers rely on their own life to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian dress , which shows him at a 11 hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians to the shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; however , as heroes he has never seen himself , according to the picture : &quot; for me , the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die of dying , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he talked about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four facade bombs on the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ inated gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; says the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest spine is almost 400 years old
more rare sight .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna &apos;s research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie won first with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; floating floating in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it comes straight to 1,@@ 220 meters in average . &quot;
&quot; only if it comes on it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
that of lon@@ el@@ iness @-@ distinctive lifestyle seems to be a god@@ body for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any of Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commenting on the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this life expectancy , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; though the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist susp@@ ects long , that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie becomes a stone old . &quot;
only failed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer to water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface usually only in winter . &quot;
researchers have to know about the lifestyle in Greenland .
her tim@@ eless sho@@ ok it as they went out in front of S@@ val@@ bard for six animals with a transmitter .
&quot; this shar@@ ks do this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed the j@@ aw bone of a young ice compartment . &quot;
&quot; possibly , they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for Kad@@ aver that made up of higher water @-@ layers after down@@ tor@@ s@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard , as conf@@ ection@@ ate from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the greatest 502 metres measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , she analyzed the shar@@ ks of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are contained in the proteins later . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in lens core .
&quot; therefore , after the early 1960s , there should be larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to 220 centi@@ meters in length , the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in the year 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 o &apos;clock was actually shown for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cm @-@ long Greenland at the age of 335 years , while the record @-@ Ha@@ i should even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; when Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females then get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ema live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the former record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland @-@ w@@ al , in its spec@@ k on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught on Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the body of the living animals often runs on spar@@ es . &quot;
so you tyres later - and al@@ tern slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , however , should invest his resources in a long life . &quot;
building background in double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the council at the youngest session is primarily concerned . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel of mayor Robert P@@ utz said that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven housing estate can finally begin . &quot;
&quot; after the basic and security issues were clari@@ fied and the applications were placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; street l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Appro@@ x section 1 ) there is nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau , young families and be@@ ekeeping senior citizens are equally concerned . &quot;
&quot; as it was called , building permission can be cons@@ ul@@ ted from now in the City Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is scheduled to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to further inquiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further industrial enterprises , together with the creation of job creation , the Municipal Council decided to re @-@ change the municipal plan in part in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the field of sub @-@ term lar@@ n , the commercial area has been extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of the Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best chances to draw from London abandoned jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain that money houses can still be operated from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough to have approval in the UK . &quot;
they just use large US banks .
banks have already announced that jobs are to be abandoned .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects a 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , re@@ united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) adopted its head office , but this is less significant for the financial sector as the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large fund sector , spir@@ ited as well as the Dublin &apos;s infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the great airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city ends with slightly available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are around 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of management consultants Mer@@ cer , the city is on place seven , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial position for the European inland market , Frankfurt could wear further banks and investors , &quot; consequently the I@@ W ref@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ xit vote , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business researcher . &quot;
&quot; according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in London , after the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector in the end of 2015 , there were 6@@ 2,500 people in the banking sector . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs of the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US National judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of the legal costs which emerged from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment in the amount of $ 200 million for injury to two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines of Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the law@@ suit filed on Thursday , U.S. National judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the cost , which emerged during the defense of the fish . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to prop@@ agate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck received each other def@@ endants and took possession of laboratory work , as sof@@ as bu@@ vi@@ r zu@@ ground , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; from the USA , troops supported that they reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; by the USA , troops supported the complete control of the northern city Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left these , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have dig@@ ged within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage from the fighters as host@@ ages , sharing Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reuters with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just run up with &quot; , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clinton earn $ 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the federal taxes
&quot; on Friday , Hillary Clinton published their tax statement for 2015 , this resulted for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for charity purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton generated sales of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster , for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ gan@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a cryp@@ tion , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and rel@@ ent@@ ment to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is common to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidate , although they are not obliged by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed as a reason for ref@@ using tax testing by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN said that he would not allow dr@@ ump to publish something before tax checks are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among other things , also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ us@@ al issues relate to assets , its donations for charity , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already cast a video on the Internet on Friday and released a video on the Internet in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump wanted to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke the subject during a speech to the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish its tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax fraud and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign campaign .
Clinton supports a control that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a election event for Hillary Clinton at last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka required buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate asked its seat to share Tr@@ ump into a meeting to share their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to an tax testing of the IRS and must not be afraid of &quot; fear &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has rec@@ alled Tax@@ es until 2007 .
&quot; Clinton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , is an effective Federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approximately 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 tax statement showed that these only USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment was a cost @-@ effective inc@@ entive fund , which was controlled by the Clinton &apos;s dividend and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

&quot; the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , trained together with the U.S. natural protection , trained by volunteers in villages in the North Tanzania , a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and har@@ vest@@ ing without being able to viol@@ ate animals . &quot;
many Spe@@ akers have previously used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world &apos;s largest day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude , with much more confidence that they can hold the eleph@@ ants of their fields without the eleph@@ ants in it , the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and bub@@ bles in a horn .

Jewish director strikes the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots had unle@@ ashed a media court after he betra@@ yed that Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has not listed any Israeli code in Berlin since there were Arabic guests requested according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; sent his arms in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country in@@ discri@@ min@@ ed list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own call center .
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel noted that the measure was a &quot; intenti@@ onal decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election is deleted , the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied from this event and be troubled .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this chain has worn in Germany in just this hotel chain , is even greater dis@@ grace . &quot;
there is no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the incident a rather large reson@@ ance in the internet , at which the people called the whole scandal . &quot;
&quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged responsibility of the Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; it was in another post that was pointed out on which the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all the accus@@ ations of themselves , and called the incident a &quot; understanding &quot; and &quot; exc@@ used &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel wasn &apos;t able to record the fast @-@ voting list , &quot; the South German newspaper quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .

&quot; students strug@@ gled together in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , with the police , when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for public education system . &quot;
the police continued Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke against the protest@@ ers .
&quot; the difficulties began as police officers attempted to deal with students , which led to the g@@ utter , rubber , and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as police . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their minds through the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed during 300,000 students to save money . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; the abol@@ ition of sanctions grew according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran in the same year by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted up against Iran , the interest in Russian businesses grew sharply in stores in the country . &quot;
Russian companies accept existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trading construction is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 grew by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade show was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign country represented around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily the travel route of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries regarding the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one might say that the record figures Irish tourists fall in Russia from last year , he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pil@@ low to the gate of mercy
the Minist@@ erial Meeting of the Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were treated . &quot;
&quot; in order to over@@ take the period up to the next no@@ vels of all minist@@ rants in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round St. Anna decided to prepare for a multi @-@ day pilgrimage migration . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ m@@ ages was checked and they finally decided for the Bishop ministry of Freiburg , where in this year of the year of tender mer@@ cies with the opened gate of Mer@@ burger Münster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ rooms made themselves on the way . &quot;
&quot; on the evening before , Rev. Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , and blessed the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train at the start of Vill@@ ingen , where a Mu@@ enster woman is standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was done from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and fon@@ ts in the morning and in the evening . &quot;
&quot; but on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches are always ra@@ ges to sing together a song from specifically ge@@ ared pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the parish of the local parish are available . &quot;
at the budget proc@@ essions Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for tasty as well as stronger dinner and breakfast .
on the second day he passed through Fur@@ tw@@ enbach to G@@ üt@@ enbach .

&quot; at the end , all participants were interested that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling &quot;
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner , last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , became fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y , and made the legend proud when he was stor@@ med to home a victory of the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the railway world championships in London despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man in whom they remained when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and S@@ kin@@ ner put an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ ander won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , he was almost returned , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy of strategy made a large part of the transformation , where Hin@@ des drove in a higher gear to slow it and to enable it to slow down the pace to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked out from his position as a BBC expert from his position and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y , and Hin@@ des , when they came to the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; we set up an Olympic record in the En@@ dr@@ unde , and defeated the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 , Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys showed that he fell off after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion by Engl@@ ands ri@@ vals .
&quot; in such a victory , this time there was no problem for this time . &quot;
hin@@ der said : &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world cap@@ tions , that it was amazing to win once again at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we are expecting successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of characteristics , it is possible in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would equal to Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint race that starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were further good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ king Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition at the Wig@@ gins with safety .
&quot; yesterday , he fought against the quali@@ fications before the qualification round , when the officials called him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; the respective female competition , which continues tomorrow and ended , av@@ anc@@ é Laura , Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK Team is reli@@ ed on its strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a flock of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations have been achieved for Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ ums were playing in the background , leaving the resignation of the technical leading Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ ons as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when you see the first night of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like it could be the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached the perfect moment of its climax , again . &quot;
the future of the melting of Portland due to repe@@ aling the energy contract
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the plant operator will termin@@ ate the contract contract and thus raising all the delivery contracts as needed .
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the plant . &quot;
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are on the game . &quot;
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ation , as the melt around 10 percent of the total generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melting , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money , and ris@@ ked a cl@@ amping . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years long spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price of the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which was delivered to the large aluminum mel@@ anch@@ ors with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ est Valley , it assumes that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller proportions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for power by the melt means &quot; divided the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continues to continue that the tre@@ aties of so @-@ called &quot; backup transactions &quot; should be made in force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore AG@@ L goes from that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that it had already written the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expectation of termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; skill of Alco@@ as ... &quot; to ensure the melt or the power supply to the melt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have to enter into effect from November this year , even if it is still an explanation , why it has been signed by the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the bad economic conditions of the industry , analysts were melting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is approximately 900 mega@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
both plants should disappear from the market would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of September issue of the Vog@@ ue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ator C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people who love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to weep , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unveil@@ ing of the co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , which ends the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ hunting and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ending with a classic honey@@ s : you have planned all of a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ ee@@ pers action almost every birthday party of a child prize ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You have forgotten that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , Kris has to take part in this Public@@ ity somehow . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes her to hit the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were shown on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue is a league for himself . &quot;
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles a fashion magazine as a fashion magazine , the output is a large number of commerci@@ als ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , of the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the journal le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the modeling &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - that is described by the journal as the &quot; passage @-@ model &quot; of its generation - under the previous category , it is in good society . &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people related or reality stars or adolescents from today who know how to move a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who are looking out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared in the last cover had appeared with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers did not like everyone .
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world . &quot;
in June the incoming Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d crit@@ ici@@ zed them &quot; Mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
&quot; this feelings then came up again , when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vog@@ ue cover . &quot;
but towards the mis@@ fortune he seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it &apos;s in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
she works for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your base of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
it sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .

the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of National Union of Municipal coun@@ cill@@ or revealed that thousands of people were dismissed each year .
Far@@ rell told that the situation without a repe@@ al of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; in Queensland , municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who have for@@ cible relationships , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and pres@@ sive debts , families who have been dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations , workers , who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who will not receive assistance they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will reduce the means by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Prosecutor and the Federal Ministry of Justice and the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , to follow these medium cuts immediately , so people who need to receive legal problems . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of European elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) , Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for government party SPD and CDU are characterized . &quot;
this is a representative p@@ olls of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ Newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could cross country in the north , this is not possible after the fra@@ gment in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both German states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the government of government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
&quot; according to the survey , the party had only slightly ahead of the CDU which could return to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left hand would be 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously : 8,7 per cent ) , the Gre@@ ens are again in the heavy country of Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the country , each with 3 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD &apos;s workforce has only been to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU was only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
&quot; it is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left hand , 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , the Af@@ D would be represented at the age of 14 per cent . &quot;
&quot; at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; E @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ geist : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market . &quot;
the followers currently domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather troubled . &quot;
&quot; initially , the built @-@ in storage was eight Meg@@ abytes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two self @-@ adhesive with high resolution . &quot;
the iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte files .
&quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , lovers of devices can still be purchased on the Internet , but they are somehow taken from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet age . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before the C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer trade fair in Hanover as &quot; office in the west @-@ bottle format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and emails were sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to Web site was possible by HTML browser , even though tor@@ mented . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 Euro . &quot;
&quot; the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in August of 1996 , no one could susp@@ ect that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
&quot; ever since , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was finally sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market already domin@@ ate the v@@ end@@ ors that were all coming later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do this , the well @-@ running business of the countless App @-@ providers and the telec@@ om accounts are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone developed a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was in early 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , everything is easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the Apple &apos;s victory began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch . &quot;
they eventually disappeared Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
&quot; after its invention , the smartphone is a self @-@ authenti@@ city 20 years after its invention . &quot;
&quot; on average , each German now sees 88 times a day on its mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn the smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens Executive Board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now available as a curse and blessing .
England has to expand the Olympic spirit and Heathrow
&quot; Heathrow will not only bring to our local municipalities and in London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow , just like the time in London in 2012 when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be able to reach new possibilities for local and companies near Heathrow .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already 10,000 new apprentices to create 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the flying environment . &quot;
&quot; as they predi@@ ct us in London 2012 , there will be such things to think that the challenge of the enlargement of the season is too large . &quot;
&quot; I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and we will blow ourselves on the world stage . &quot;
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong in Heathrow .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but Heathrow touched every one . &quot;
as the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for single a infrastructure project .
&quot; extension is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport as well as in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heathrow , which has a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure programme in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport enter@@ minal , which was built in the midst of the world &apos;s two frequencies . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third drive , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the Heathrow &apos;s expansion will be one .
&quot; it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and Heathrow and create our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of England . &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and maus@@ oleum &quot; regarding display block &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to handle ad block@@ ers , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - und Maus@@ oleum &quot; earn money . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be advertis@@ ements on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post in which it suggests that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook was shared with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding regarding its advertis@@ ements to identify it , which is part of the public@@ ity that is part of the advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that there has been a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battles between the att@@ enti@@ cing Open Source Community and the conver@@ ters have already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in progress , and that Facebook can soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest businesses in the fight has left in the struggle , is a strong indi@@ ct@@ ose who has become wor@@ r@@ ying display for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe &apos;s last year , some 200 million people use indicators ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users of active users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , make Hand@@ y@@ advertising 84 percent of the im@@ bur@@ ial fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display blocks on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues , so Facebook represents an investment of such stri@@ de as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that there would be his &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over them aimed at targeted advertis@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would like new filters , because they were also blocking content on the side , which are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ters are a m@@ ute means , why we have concentrated on developing tools such as ad pre@@ ferences , to put out more control into the hands of the people instead . &quot;
woman suspected comm@@ itting suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls witnesses , after a woman was transferred to the early morning hours on Thursday at a susp@@ icious suicide by several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred at A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Lake Geneva shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; to the street , and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 is that of several vehicles , including a truck , was to kill himself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some have not been identified yet , the police , who , as well as every witness of the incident , said to report . &quot;
&quot; there was a preliminary proceedings opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter presented the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; that is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not drawn to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - one person in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers didn &apos;t need to go out that a pede@@ stri@@ ans walk in the middle of the night as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman was acquitted when she ski@@ pped a man and killed a man , who was one night at the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious in the street . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the polic@@ eman answered -- that had answered an emergency call -- to a justified manner , and that the presence of a man was on the road an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should be under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus once resi@@ li@@ ent
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble from climate research .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have found er@@ d@@ similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ al@@ lied atmosphere , and slowly turning slowly . &quot;
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de Earth , but had once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and shake before faster . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 per cent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is almost two months of the sun , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of large solar heat . &quot;
the result are average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
&quot; the model brought a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles Evolution , which was suspected by Plan@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; although it was once more hab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed . &quot;
their oceans and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen ent@@ with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a lower participation in the decision making of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the association will immediately seek after a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth to give it a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
&quot; he must also have a decisive decisions on decisions , which influence the performance of the teams . &quot;
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who joined Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked his contributions to the team for the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the winner of the League Adams Awards during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the League of the League .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the two last years . &quot;
the practices in season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ o@@ workers take talks back , put out strike &quot;
&quot; the workers are exposed to re@@ mun@@ eration for the northern sea workers , while all parties involved in a new discussion on the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were held spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea that operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group , as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ end@@ ents trade unions can confirm that we have united ourselves to restart the process process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop a few day sessions in the next weeks that will start the beginning next year to re @-@ start the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , would be a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s ratings follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to companies required the required space to come across the market turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and plans to set up plans to reduce its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ ement attacks with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , a economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament of Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest employers in the North Sea since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many , not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star@@ vation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; the latest Mission , with the Kepler Wel@@ space teles@@ cope , astronom@@ ers helped to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of constellation of Ple@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in star enh@@ ancers , as well as in which connection the rotation @-@ time rooms with the planet of planning . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience the comparison of our results with other star enh@@ ancers , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his Solar System , said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ vation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which emerged about 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
you are now turning the fastest one .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these mature stars fall large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since this winds are travelling by the stars of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is al@@ yp@@ assed , its rot@@ ational rate starts to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star taking the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable constellation -- such as sun@@ spots -- recognize .
&quot; the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars , slower than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull equ@@ ates the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower and slower than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , better against faster rot@@ ors , to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star@@ vation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmetics laboratory to compare pitches such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the shooting of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of us how we would like to learn more about how , when , when and why stars are slow down their rot@@ ational rates , so to speak to her &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; after his emotional back@@ rest notice , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the Tri@@ mil@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
I tell &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant of Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth deal gained a year of 27 million US dollars annually .
&quot; until the end of the contra@@ diction on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with power . &quot;

with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old doesn &apos;t have yet to be taken into the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was on the field so disputed its occurr@@ ence outside of the square .
&quot; already in 2009 , the Super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was forbidden from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was imprisoned for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called bi@@ gen@@ esis scandal . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a rule , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a pleasure for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot;
his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; during many bas@@ eball legends in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include farewell @-@ tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and actress Kate Hudson , sympath@@ y def@@ ends the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ al Boston Red SO@@ x . &quot;

&quot; for Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had been demonstrated last Sunday , that is used as m@@ asked resources for D@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ stan@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en was supposed to take part in the plans of 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; the National Association take the matter &apos; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the examinations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we are working together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the CA@@ S is no longer responsible for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ ened the news about the positive sample near Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive itself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the female athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is supposed to act with the banned substance for the blood d@@ oping agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was provision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow promptly applied immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t get the right battles , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
so about all the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation must not take part in Rio .
&quot; on Friday , the &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested three days earlier on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both den@@ ces the taking , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa case is a further serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport art . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of System@@ atic D@@ op@@ ings , also the L@@ äu@@ er@@ nation Kenya produces many bad news . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous version in China had also su@@ ck@@ led to violent cl@@ ashes between athletes . &quot;
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t seized the Chinese Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , I said Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a meditation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping che@@ aters , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships for the stim@@ ulation of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month sper@@ re . &quot;
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ ting h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ s@@ om
programm@@ ers of ext@@ ortion @-@ Malware are currently targeted and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once , some of some victims of an attack with ext@@ ortion @-@ software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; 40 per cent of the victims paid to be paid by the perpet@@ rators required by perpet@@ rators , to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their ext@@ ortion @-@ software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company network .
&quot; they are successful there , the potential @-@ level sub@@ sid@@ y is considerably higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators were discovered for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once more on the computer of a victim , they are looking for targeted files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as from archives and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of ext@@ ortion .
&quot; to get the final code code to the files , the victim must have money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ gger Bit@@ coin - refer . &quot;
&quot; but where individuals use the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a Ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business activities completely , in one case people were living in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of acute acute acute . &quot;
&quot; we say the sacrifices always : pays not , it only encour@@ ages the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; yet , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to refuse the call of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the researchers from F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the ext@@ ortion and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money . &quot;
&quot; you will explain to their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free @-@ accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example . &quot;
&quot; and individuals who are saved after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must have hard to negoti@@ ate and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s in order to withdraw their data un@@ turn@@ key . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ext@@ ortion , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely to be three or four . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building to the actual ext@@ ortion .
&quot; the existing malware kits were created by malware , advice and additional tools bought for one time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the press@@ ors are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you can log in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set of a criminal and commissioned a further to install the software on your many PCs . &quot;
the payment is performed per un@@ specified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; normally , the crimin@@ als then spy on the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ d@@ y@@ tes survey trust the Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators already pursue new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful enlighten@@ ment , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as client lists or price calcul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the compensation amount depends on type of data by a multiple higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpet@@ rators may now also take new targets on the Internet of things . &quot;
on the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers how they could get connected with the Internet associated Thermo@@ stat under their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of a der@@ art block could definitely be quite a ran@@ s@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators will then block a whole manufacturing street instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , has actually proved extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the f@@ ond , it works in no place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the inside are well processed and are pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ side falls something . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V at the storage room .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ speed and 10@@ 26 l of folded back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bank can be folded like Kin@@ os@@ bo@@ ilers and offer the storage space that is from the floor to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be well loaded , but the charging height is 650 mm somewhat higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
&quot; however , he should set a little more qui@@ eter than his work . &quot;
pleasing is the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine version : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is well balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit of direct .
the equipment can be found in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
&quot; in addition to the security systems , the City not@@ ch ( runs up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the trace driver assistance . &quot;
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ated because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ent objects . &quot;
the remote assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign detection and imp@@ s@@ sel@@ t when needed .
&quot; the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are something terrible .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday suit@@ ability . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on passengers
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the airport gas bridge .
&quot; for a liability is possible only with dangers which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Upper District Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken himself in the fall of a knee .
&quot; however , the accident could never happen everywhere - it is a common life risk , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
&quot; after their journey , just returned money when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ less in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten per cent of the guests are reported to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ating case , a family on the second day of their Turkish lu@@ bs was heavily involved in diarr@@ hea and vomiting . &quot;
she spent almost all the holidays in the room .
their disease conducted the holi@@ day@@ makers on a defective cl@@ utter@@ ance which allegedly poll@@ utes the sea water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey was to be lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; before judgment , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; although the applicant was defective , indeed . &quot;
but the organizer learned just before departure the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to go out until then that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he didn &apos;t hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of the water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - wom@@ bs one another through infection - belong to the general life risk .
only 38 people were ill of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence involved in refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be sober and decided to react to terror at the same time .
safe is : our country will not respond to the violence of the perpet@@ rators .
we will not indul@@ ge this triumph .
&quot; if off@@ ender have to leave the country qu@@ icker , increase the security and strength of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced a further person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism must be pun@@ ish@@ able again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon legislation will be agreed upon , especially the purchase of weapons in the Internet is expected . &quot;
the last much discussed silence for doctors should remain after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical juice , he wants to search for solutions such as endanger@@ ing citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic views . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be prepared better for dealing with trau@@ matic people .
&quot; on the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security of the SPD . &quot;
it is important that the Interior spoke clearly against action against action .
&quot; this was a ear@@ piece for the builders in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspaper of Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abol@@ ition of double nationality previously rejected .
a general ban on complet@@ eness he is problem@@ atic for constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t offer everything you re@@ jects and I will rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about road traffic or witnesses before judgment .
&quot; green @-@ boss Simone Peter rejected the minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terrorism packages and action . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ Left Party Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et and a deep@@ ening of the residence take the people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it is standing regularly on the move road - here a picture of November .
but that is supposed to change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ur shall be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all of the cars , who stand in traffic on the ambient road every night when they ride over the Highway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler road , the right track down to 700 meters . &quot;
driver can then go directly from the Hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , whereby the total of it will be improved on the multi@@ scale section of the Federal Road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West , Germany . &quot;
driving on the fe@@ eder is nervous before everything between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; week@@ days goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ es route , and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler road .
&quot; from here , traffic is only one lane over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be re@@ built in front of a three @-@ quarter years .
the reason : static calculations revealed that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to absorb the heavy duty of heavy traffic .
&quot; as long as these bott@@ len@@ eck and which is connected to be connected , the state office cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official remaining length until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ur , the country &apos;s business is deliberately looking for a limited time in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
Inter@@ cultural tour : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club Nim@@ a &apos;s and the Young Theater now plan a music project .
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s Club allows young people to visit with a migration and refugee grounds , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; class International &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; is an introduction of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster , Germany . &quot;
in the context of the association Nim@@ a &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging of the small house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the club , which has set itself the cultural integration of adolescents with mig@@ rant and refugee grounds , schools with welcome groups have the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most adolescents of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and a little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible to follow the course of the course , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s Association , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers will be able to visit young people and mig@@ rant back@@ grounds between 14 and 20 years , professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
&quot; offers for children and families in the field of theater play , the@@ atri@@ cal language distribution , are in planning . &quot;
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association with many classes , who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather repair
&quot; the weather was made by the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the night of the night to Friday , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was very suitable for clouds and rain badly to observe the heavenly spectac@@ le , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many stars in heaven . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ ei@@ den , which includes 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the quick@@ est stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; at night , one gets around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is not enough to think out of the wake @-@ up . &quot;
this is everything else than relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent do their sleep frequently or permanently as relaxing as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be multiple causes based on them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ak , Member of the Board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand this , but it is the in@@ som@@ nie , so an input and sleep distur@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; as a uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German Haus@@ medical association with practice in the Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el , is not sufficient . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
&quot; organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ oral factors can be used , but also drugs . &quot;
not rare is the distur@@ bing expression of another disease .
&quot; very early wake up is common with depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it may be that various factors are necess@@ ar@@ able .
&quot; for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lying , all two to three hours , and would be bl@@ az@@ ed to greet you all day problems and cause to greet you , We@@ eks gives an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I be with sleep problems to the doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week , a doctor should go to the doctor &apos;s doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , slaugh@@ tered , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve the sleep distur@@ b@@ ulation , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , such as behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ ask . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ fa , head of the inter@@ disciplinary dormit@@ ory centre of the Char@@ ité University of Berlin , has hardly been emphas@@ ised in Germany . &quot;
&quot; this is why you should contact with sleeping difficulties , at first at home , contact We@@ eks . &quot;
the problems can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; for an investigation in the dormitories of medical laboratory , for example with snor@@ ing with breathing , if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ dge disorder , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a circulation disorder . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not only make a nap sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , one goes into bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body you can bear s@@ ungl@@ asses , chest strap and an ant@@ enn@@ as at the finger . &quot;
there is also a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can suffer@@ ers get problems in the handle ?
&quot; there are pretty lots of screws , where you can set for a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; Woe is on : regular sleeping and rising time , not too long in bed , not to sleep long in bed , not watching TV to sleep , alcohol do not throw away from the night - then it begins immediately to calculate , and that &apos;s quite and not favorable . &quot;
what to do with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself for the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ ians .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha , and exhibited his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ athl@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook has committed himself against his involvement in the ex @-@ team @-@ mate . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger gets £ 20,000 , and a k@@ ins@@ el@@ kö@@ nig of 150.000 , no one should wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the feed system in the swimming pool was bad , the d@@ oping controls , however , very good . &quot;
&quot; so we can not compete with countries that are very much promoting and run on d@@ oping down , or even run it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be adjusted here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler should have reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
it is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; if you cannot receive a certain time before the World Cup / OS of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A can not take part , &quot; calls for the Hamburg @-@ Hamburger , who now operates a ice cream . &quot;
airport : gang of luggage was arrested
professional Die@@ be at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police attacked the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ verd@@ ant had committed several hand@@ ker@@ at@@ en- and luggage @-@ pil@@ es as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf signed a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from last theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ ac@@ ies since mid @-@ July , and were involved in general , working and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialist in the Criminal Code 34 , the Die@@ ben , who had travelled to Germany &apos;s off@@ ences to Germany , can prove four actions . &quot;
&quot; they had caught a total of over 15,000 euros in total . &quot;
&quot; built in Alt@@ constructions , a few Lin@@ den@@ b@@ aker , in between another small head of head : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in looks at the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk down the east from the east to west , one comes along playing golf courses , a buffet @-@ kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
someone has ug@@ ly &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; to the facade of a gray house !
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , who should soon be demolished , is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be pre@@ fers with burning cars in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents rent ten@@ ders , on the ground floor , however , spaces are still occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator , Henkel , had been awarded several times for a hard demonstration by the police against the project as &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting @-@ point autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers and three teams in front of the site , closed parts of the road , and held visitors off to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the building owner of the unknown house owners had the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacu@@ ation had been illegal , and a day later , police and workers passed under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ prising . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens lie . &quot;
&quot; le@@ ft@@ ist violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * that are here three children , mostly by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the skin , they share care of increasing r@@ ins@@ ets and vent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to send a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ zing Left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , who occupied the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between Haus@@ er and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin@@ s was actually a traditional labor quarter , which also today has a lower average of average income and a lower risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; also , home @-@ occupied projects and the born living projects are already long as a Kie@@ z : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic , including nearly the entire Main Street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them for 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and elections from around the world : with them share residents from GDR times and former home occupied their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ builds in the Rig@@ a@@ er will be attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them into the designed slices or freshly painted faç@@ ades that were thrown out with color@@ ings .
no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words of &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for this not to view all the neighbors as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to polic@@ emen , according to polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the off@@ ences make atomic facts , rather than new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the cont@@ est@@ ing 94 for 17 years , can be no speech of un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; regarding the violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ ful : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , which were not the case . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal action , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help each other , live together on the road , and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore it was so important that the residents return their streets : from the police , politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the districts . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by rest@@ art@@ ful new@@ buildings in former builders , which push the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many - here , rather people who are not so well , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should one do if someone has never been listening to someone ?
&quot; there places fru@@ stration on all sides , even by the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; a little understanding of colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who moves , should be aware of that - just like someone who moves into a pub @-@ quarter , can be po@@ or@@ ly complain about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons placed only with first names have asked , not to be called by their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee camp
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of management for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it looks as a Cont@@ act@@ in for all stakeholders , refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client from the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now being thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le has now been there , which has a problem , especially a problem . &quot;
so some - less p@@ ott@@ ling than rather on the multitude of desire responsibilities are targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the job .
&quot; for a long experience in the field of social work , an administration for a talent of languages and people connected with a long experience in the field of social work . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; especially , it is about organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is hon@@ ing and full @-@ official players . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been found since some time to find apartments for the connections of fle@@ eing .
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented apartments .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
&quot; the responsibility changes from Land@@ rat , including Commun@@ e and job center . &quot;
problem : there are free objects but not any land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; until now , it has not been working , so you have reli@@ ed on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community apartments must be found , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; besides a firm lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , educational institutions , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or established . &quot;
&quot; more places were good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home master , do @-@ profit char@@ itable work - and the motivated and very tidy , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
that was &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; activity , however , does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people have to develop a random sensation .
&quot; so , offers offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central , that the refugees get the feeling that they are allowed in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must declare the refugees that it will take , and they can make the time sensible , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever can feel the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never be confused . &quot;
the significant majority is motivated .
&quot; but there is also a problem , say customer hon@@ estly , &quot; People , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
that is all a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a tough question : did the two have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client very clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher might be called &quot; . &quot; a residual risk can and would not exclu@@ de it . &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensiti@@ zed . &quot;
these inci@@ dents also relate to the refugees .
&quot; the fear , that the attacks , they would complete them completely . &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and honorary posts must hold on site and look for activities in the region . &quot;
&quot; in the background , they are always in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants might come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a limit ?
&quot; to answer this question , the policy is shy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to put them hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we would like , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Client also makes a clear fact that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been working with that , to integrate the current people . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 persons , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need , they have to help them , both women are lon@@ ely . &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated there is no easy answers .
