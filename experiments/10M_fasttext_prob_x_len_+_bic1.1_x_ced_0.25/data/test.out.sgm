<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - we want to prevent both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential applicants are subject to tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against it, as the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulators."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to strike the economy, and regulate the economy, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will resign tuulists massively, and he is strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, he has opened disadvantageous opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the tax for the rich will increase, says they."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the needs to be invested in, say Trump and Clinton almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are refused by state-critical teacy wings of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Trump, there might be a party internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and return the coal transport in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible to date protected areas in the unprotected areas of Paris.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast to its investment program, Clinton will explicitly extend the renewable energies and demands:" a country will create the superpower of the clean energies and create millions jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be there."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the tranazide trading agreement, will not sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, both of the US do not want to protect from international trade - just better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better then for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it to 15 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage needs to be, then he says he would not be altered."</seg>
<seg id="29">"however, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax politics of the two camps."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one hand, Trump, who wants to stimulate the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him ahead, so the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton is standing at least from the rich who wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the escape:" many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honour, slavery, or forced prostitution."</seg>

<seg id="34">Many women are used to say that they don't say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust, openly about the living, because the shame is too big."</seg>

<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District committees for the accommodation of refugees are responsible."</seg>

<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, women are not divided separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press presidents of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are in some common accommodation floors or private homes only for single women and their children."</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called their union to adopt new jobs during their disputes in regard to a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of proclaiming the words of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot defend the expression that Ankara wants to be the most reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a blow, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile was very narrow, and he hardly felt heat, even for its restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report about five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper that Erdogan had behaved so much, than would never happen anything."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, enthusiasm seemed rather to interpret the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but Putin met Putin that the state of State of Russia, however, showed that the state of State of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his introductory words: the surplus of a Russian fighter-plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was wutentlessly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"even bigger, as it was committed by a friend of my boyfriend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"building up again, it becomes difficult when not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a strong, unrestricted assault on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once again, it seemed to be the Turks to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the accusations of conductive officials, Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trafficking in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was only held because Putin received the debt of the President of Erdogan who wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire is clear at hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first of all the friends who he can get after he has got almost his amassed last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal tower in the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the national television forecast for fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agriculture imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry for the West as it considers his reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent Groll comes across the snowy contempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pivotal to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state leader won a bonus that he asked for the attempted coup d" support for the chosen state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a self-understandable thing for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regimen."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glittering palace made it possible by Russia and Turkey, one as it described me an analyst," alliance of outsides ": two countries that were cut off from the West and feel bad, and now serve."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nonetheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey will support objectionable pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be notable that after almost three hours, both presidents were held on the press conference, that they would not even striped out."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey suspects it to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there is no unique consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disperaster, when NATO member Turkey took off the Russian battle jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green: investors are to become a lot stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig is going to lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes an "action concept" in the coming rating.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first, it is about the question: who should actually build the affordable housing?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Christoph Bratmann says:" "we are with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, must show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the affordable housing can also be created in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the great dispute in the town hall was, however, Bratmann:" how about investors who want to build on private faces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors on such areas as at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing project which will cost millions and will have to be financed by incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" there is no agreement between the fractions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as a few regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left is still tougher to investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of what, the Bratmann, the Flag is a deepening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">The action concept will be implemented and will provide additional tasks in construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program does not stand fully: for the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments, whose promotion will be running in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planning spokesperson on Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments again back to the price integration."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West City.</seg>
<seg id="26">A blow would solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for the end of the Western city, the deadlines run from the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could bring back to the price of cheap apartments there."</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: these are the owners who do not build homes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the number of social housing in the West city is drastically increased, it is removed by the aim of the so-called."</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens therefore reckon that there will be a movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel withdrew his immune system and throeflex of a serious test - having raised some of the dirty and most populous places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabte its course on a euro notes, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a squeezing in a train radio as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the end of any object, he used a Luminometer to show and let us show what he is getting into."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results in daylight. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the rinsing button of a drawcord, which was already used by thousands of others, might be completely shockable, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he stretched out, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his Darms by moving through the world, and ate wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to rinsets of toilets; the task assigned its immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told me:" already as a kid I was relatively inconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and slute water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was just going to meet his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its commission showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, Luminometric numbers is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to withdraw after their Luminometric number was over 4000 units, while fresh-washed hands were less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number of places in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" this comes the worst thing I smoked in a toilet, close. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing to dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not touch here because it is incompatible here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumer consumer really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explain the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We brought crazy brainstorings that finished with that we said "Let us call ourselves Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film's film, added:" let it be so saying - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of things I have relied on him, like the Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things, in which it was easier to bring Ian to join them and others in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we have recorded some of these dirty treats.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by the survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of respondents identified Milk acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they are at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but it cannot be addressed, that the assessors of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees."</seg>

<seg id="10">So let's throw a look at.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of SoHos is slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sales were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera to be able to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I was by Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men middle aged) to Reckless Records (data count: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector? I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess it already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record boards, pictured above (he has sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed at home), clothed the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he had been released and again to buy objects he sold, when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 1960s, early 70s that appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to be too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who want to buy records, rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I smoke not, and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who works by Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets it on YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also notices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the conversations that I have led, people usually have entailed their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs, to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to a specific age of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record shops offering a calming community of equipinns.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>

<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal wrong.</seg>

<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who have bought a record last month, they haven't heard it yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inevitable, a runner-up between competition and streches."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, when the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is to protect from the wristbands to the Turner for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not set the TV set, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the maintenance long in coffee shop, without about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could have been sent among these known names, which would have been sent to Prime Time, that if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for the Olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, some in the shade are sports, which are not universally recognized: aerial view, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it reign for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet of the trampolins."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so rare that many people questioned I had asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympic portart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"even though the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final wound."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men, the Chinese, and the Canadians to share the women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada, defend their gold medal in London this year."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampolinjumping has a certain external player, partly because it sounds for a clownsschool for a clownsschool as that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only one enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous tremors of his never to end - but also the Grazie of the Turnens and Tauber, the two sports which are essentially combined."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means that much means like" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"the winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a range of falling movements (turning, hamming and sage) before they landing at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be evaluated according to official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time." "</seg>

<seg id="27">"you do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also in the TV transfer also another height: the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted Streets is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir up even a spectator."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that many protesters were killed during clashes with the police in Schwallet.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just doing it together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid board with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past few months, protests against the government and expanded steadily in more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was inhibited according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were fired by armed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, some of the protests, who are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security personnel are armed with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to summarise this country and in future it will even be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services closely cooperate with the Ethiopians to fight terror into the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new coup in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continued the repression of repression of the opposition - the opposition in the country has been restricted to their silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and those no other options have to protest apart, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous symptoms that cover everything from ground use to the sausages in regards to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border with Eritrea. a battle for this contentious, controversial line caused hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front, who were forced out more or less forced on the past few years, could be armed and armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the deceiture after years ago are now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved its internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government locked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, above all in protests, so many people can still communicate on Internet proxies, they hide where they may stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since apples prospered the Amharas, mainly Christian highlands, in politics and the economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in flax areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population, who are dominant in the military, in commerce and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-sealed illness in the years 2012 for 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly distanced in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use custom assigned to make adversaries and to make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this fundamentally," "Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively uncautious reasons to capture the position of Lord Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Mr. Hailemariam came from the south, when Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many feared that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested by the government, which apparently dragged out by the government and then stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razors, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts in Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlermont, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">"but apparently, this has not prevented the intention of the internal abuse of Ethiopian government."</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, Protestants in Gondar, a amharic city, led by tigray-managed shops and hatred against the tigray in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests and other Western allies have a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government, Ethiopia used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenades on the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently noted that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want his ally to coincide in a volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr Abdi," "is a very thin free hike."</seg>

<seg id="9">That of loneliness-distinctive lifestyle seems to be a godbody for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal" Science "in any of Greenland, who could be 392 years old."</seg>

<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer to water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the surface usually only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have to know about the lifestyle in Greenland.</seg>

<seg id="18">"this sharks do this sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young ice compartment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly, they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for Kadaver that made up of higher water-layers after downtorswings."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard, as confectionate from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the greatest 502 metres measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, she analyzed the sharks of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, which are contained in the proteins later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, after the early 1960s, there should be larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in contrast to 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in the year 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland's sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens, which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>

<seg id="29">"when Grönlandhai-females then get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalema live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the former record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland-wal, in its speck on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught on Alaska."</seg>

<seg id="36">So you tyres later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Scotland Callum Skinner, last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, became fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy, and made the legend proud when he was stormed to home a victory of the favourites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympiad medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they took place in March at the railway world championships in London despite the backdrop of Hoys just a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they remained when they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolds."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner put an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealander won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, he was almost returned, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a strategy of strategy made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it and to enable it to slow down the pace to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked out from his position as a BBC expert from his position and fell Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes, when they came to the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">"we set up an Olympic record in the Endrunde, and defeated the world champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012, Kenny's and Hoys showed that he fell off after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection by Englands rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in such a victory, this time there was no problem for this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">Hinder said: "it feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we have come so badly with so many world captions, that it was amazing to win once again at the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation who won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expecting successful five days at the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of characteristics, it is possible in the realm of Possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>

<seg id="30">That would equal to Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint race that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>

<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>

<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>

<seg id="43">"the respective female competition, which continues tomorrow and ended, avancé Laura, Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK Team is relied on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations have been achieved for Rio."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, Drums were playing in the background, leaving the resignation of the technical leading Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbingons as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, when you see the first night of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like it could be the legendary reputation GBS, which has reached the perfect moment of its climax, again."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion-Malware are currently targeted and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Abwehr specialists Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, some of some victims of an attack with extortion-software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a Ransomware-extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 per cent of the victims paid to be paid by the perpetrators required by perpetrators, to be able to use the challenged systems and data."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their extortion-software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they are successful there, the potential-level subsidy is considerably higher than in private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware software," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators were discovered for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once more on the computer of a victim, they are looking for targeted files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as from archives and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final code code to the files, the victim must have money - usually in the form of Cryptogger Bitcoin - refer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where individuals use the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off when a Ransomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the business activities completely, in one case people were living in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of acute acute acute."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the sacrifices always: pays not, it only encourages the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"yet, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to refuse the call of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the researchers from F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the extortion and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you will explain to their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free-accessible support sites, or decrypt for free example."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and individuals who are saved after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must have hard to negotiate and pay five-digit sums in order to withdraw their data unturnkey."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potential high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware-extortion, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely to be three or four."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building to the actual extortion.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the existing malware kits were created by malware, advice and additional tools bought for one time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors are looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you can log in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set of a criminal and commissioned a further to install the software on your many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is performed per unspecified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"normally, the criminals then spy on the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Malwardytes survey trust the Ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful enlightenment, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as client lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"with this, the compensation amount depends on type of data by a multiple higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators may now also take new targets on the Internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated safety researchers how they could get connected with the Internet associated Thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the activation of a derart block could definitely be quite a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators will then block a whole manufacturing street instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at night, one gets around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is not enough to think out of the wake-up."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is everything else than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent do their sleep frequently or permanently as relaxing as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be multiple causes based on them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weak, Member of the Board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand this, but it is the insomnie, so an input and sleep disturbing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as a unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Hausmedical association with practice in the Saxony-Saxon Varel, is not sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychic or behavioral factors can be used, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the disturbing expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is common with depression frequently," says Weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors are necessarable.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, if you have a herniated disc, can be poorly lying, all two to three hours, and would be blazed to greet you all day problems and cause to greet you, Weeks gives an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I be with sleep problems to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week, a doctor should go to the doctor's doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite different: one is smitten, tired, slaughtered, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep disturbulation, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options, such as behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inask."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fifa, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory centre of the Charité University of Berlin, has hardly been emphasised in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this is why you should contact with sleeping difficulties, at first at home, contact Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">The problems can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an investigation in the dormitories of medical laboratory, for example with snoring with breathing, if you do not find the cause of a sledge disorder, or if you don't find the cause of a circulation disorder."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not only make a nap sleep," says Fiber. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes into bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body you can bear sunglasses, chest strap and an antennas at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">"there are pretty lots of screws, where you can set for a better sleep."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Woe is on: regular sleeping and rising time, not too long in bed, not to sleep long in bed, not watching TV to sleep, alcohol do not throw away from the night - then it begins immediately to calculate, and that's quite and not favorable."</seg>

<seg id="5">"articles about this" trendy neighborhood "," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be prefers with burning cars in the past few weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents rent tenders, on the ground floor, however, spaces are still occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin Innensenator, Henkel, had been awarded several times for a hard demonstration by the police against the project as" No-Go Zone "for policemen and the 94 as a starting-point autonomous force."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers and three teams in front of the site, closed parts of the road, and held visitors off to enter the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the building owner of the unknown house owners had the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later, police and workers passed under the cheers of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are enterprising."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, a primary school and kindergartens lie."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana * that are here three children, mostly by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the skin, they share care of increasing rinsets and ventrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted to send a majority of police protection from vandzing Left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, who occupied the Berlin Innensenator and the police between Hauser and their neighbours, does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East Berlins was actually a traditional labor quarter, which also today has a lower average of average income and a lower risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"also, home-occupied projects and the born living projects are already long as a Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic, including nearly the entire Main Street near the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been vacated under large police officers, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them for 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become the magnets for tourists and elections from around the world: with them share residents from GDR times and former home occupied their Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this also noticeable in the rents, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuilds in the Rigaer will be attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them into the designed slices or freshly painted façades that were thrown out with colorings.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year so often with the words of "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for this not to view all the neighbors as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to policemen, according to policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the largest part of the offences make atomic facts, rather than new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the contesting 94 for 17 years, can be no speech of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"regarding the violence, it is weightful: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, which were not the case."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will give it right in the Rigaer longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal action, on the contrary:" here you can help each other, live together on the road, and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Rigaer Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"therefore it was so important that the residents return their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the districts."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by restartful newbuildings in former builders, which push the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here, rather people who are not so well," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I absolutely not gutheirs."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone has never been listening to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there places frustration on all sides, even by the police and the residents."</seg>
<seg id="37">"a little understanding of colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must declare the refugees that it will take, and they can make the time sensible, for example, with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever can feel the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never be confused."</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also a problem, say customer honestly," People, in which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">That is all a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a tough question: did the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small municipality like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine client very clearly," "what mancher might be called". "a residual risk can and would not exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitized."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents also relate to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the fear, that the attacks, they would complete them completely."</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and honorary posts must hold on site and look for activities in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in the background, they are always in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants might come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question, the policy is shy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not arrived in Urbach, where we would like," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine Client also makes a clear fact that the Urbacher has already been working with that, to integrate the current people."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 persons, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"however, if people are in need, they have to help them, both women are lonely."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated there is no easy answers.</seg>
