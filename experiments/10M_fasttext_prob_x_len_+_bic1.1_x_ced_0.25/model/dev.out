Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not friendly .
&quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and , relating to the dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , however , there should also be a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been cl@@ amped for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the constant settlement of Israel and prevents the fail@@ ing effect in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of the deal struck by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has further deteri@@ orated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , had held a controversial speech which was used as an aff@@ r@@ ont against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not speaking with Obama , a meeting had agreed with regard to the vote in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor asked to have shot his friend . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told him by Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb with a slightly z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb had been important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; in the house the officials found the Ly@@ che from Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was on a white block : &quot; I just wanted to do it , I loved it , I loved it , and she was the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was , according to the authorities in the letter , and he was well signed from Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication of the fact that , Mississippi , who traveled two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , Mississippi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by the police on the grounds of his office . &quot;
Delta @-@ University Poli@@ gra@@ pher Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ itäts @-@ Emplo@@ ye@@ es have heard this shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fat@@ eful emer@@ gen@@ cies sometime later .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : a lamb took life , when the police ch@@ ained him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and lecturer forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to pro@@ cure yourself a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the con@@ ciliation at both ends of the state details , such as those who knew him who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students told that they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal responsibility . &quot;
&quot; even by him , lamb had mentioned in a written book in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he divided his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both submitted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , of which 17 members includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations related to problem@@ atic behavior .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aches , who praised God , said he was also a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously been asked by Delta State University for health reasons , and thus said that it has any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he established only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the University hopes that the promotion , who had worked so hard for the Lamb , would do no guarantee for an automatic road to be present as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs not@@ ion . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane , when he arrived in Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , but by a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said . &quot;
his car ran on .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs , he described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ y said she was 15 and lamb had been 20 when they met together through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy , who tried some years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
he was then the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; all girls have melted away when he was there , &quot; said Pra@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot;
&quot; lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss , obviously , were some time together . &quot;
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who joined them in the brick @-@ house with them , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; her ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &apos; Ste@@ en said he never met lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago in a summer fair . &quot;
later they played along one or other gig .
&quot; O &apos; Ste@@ en said , his daughter sp@@ ans and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica night at night , after lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica . &quot;
there was no signs that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on the evacu@@ ating and captured .
I mean they both had a good sense .
&quot; Dr. Schmidt , the total professor , conducted the first semester program and specialized in American territory and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English teacher at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of the Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; around 900 people took part on the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , including lecturer , staff , students and members of the church on a parish light Memorial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated at the vig@@ il , while the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
lessons will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland . Mississippi .
&quot; Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now told that lamb had shot the emergency , and that the lamb had shot in his emergency call Pr@@ ent@@ iss already called his wife , but there was no indication of the fact that both of them have been married . &quot;
Toys R Us is planning to introduce less workers for the Christmas season

Michael J. Fox and his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre in the roy@@ als and I note that the seat is next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated track and an arm length being removed , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;

&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ str@@ at@@ ly the biggest time @-@ trip film ever turned out . &quot;
&quot; back in time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinemas in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s strengthening military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen poverty and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss calls for once again all parties , including the shared UN security council , to join together and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban on Wednesday told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member states of the Council of the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly Special Session in Syria to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the insur@@ rection in the Council and in the Syrian people , and the Regional Policy , in@@ sol@@ uble this situation . &quot;
&quot; ban requested the five permanent members to show the crisis in Syria , in order to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they have proven to be a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 responses to show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand cast him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; any@@ how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump of the upper parts at the bottom , it did not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask themselves what it means for the opportunities of the nomin@@ ation of the real estate Mog@@ adi@@ . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the electoral period . &quot;
no claims that Tr@@ ump is probably win the republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ize that at that time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led him to the Rising Herman Cain , who won &apos;t have won only one state in the nomin@@ ation process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; however , outdoor groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ um@@ ps per@@ sever@@ ance and start to flow their dollars to over@@ turn it . &quot;
here are some current survey values which indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary stage :
tr@@ um@@ ps provision values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view from Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures rise in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa last week found that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters will be happy with p@@ umping as candidates .
&quot; in a survey from CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enth@@ used &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed if he would be the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; enth@@ used &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament is not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely crit@@ ici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive drugs , 52 percent of those who had the real Iranian voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul looks the right temperature for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not gain the personality to effectively implement his office , and almost six out of 10 factors that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors are getting used to the idea .
&quot; when they place your schol@@ ar , Republi@@ can elec@@ torate W@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked those who win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation will win , according to a survey from CNN / OR@@ C , four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
that is a change since the date when four of July ended her money to Je@@ b Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this stage in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation , just 28 % for the final candidates , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will see Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump happens almost every day . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ned field probably contributes to Tr@@ uman &apos;s leadership , which is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidate diff@@ us . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is controlling the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of Walker 15 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ am and Chris Christie 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would out@@ run the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a close majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have made their opinion .
&quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have won their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 per cent said they openly advised the door , to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently used for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on the topic of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign in front of two months , &quot; immigrants from Mexico &quot; called the &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic ex@@ pressing of Tr@@ ump is crucial in Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ orient@@ ated efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in question of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparent too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration on the government climbed to new high@@ s .
&quot; by now , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son fall out half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by its out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by The Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can be fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at the Congress , at 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; on the street , a parking area costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros on average . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is natural , it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which particular areas costs a square meter most . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little . &quot;
&quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top @-@ locations , however , one of the price does occur . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ al@@ ex@@ ts in dizz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several ten@@ ths of ten thousand euros - per square meter , well noticed . &quot;
&quot; well , who can afford it ... &quot;
by the way : Munich is not an exception here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two veil@@ tails in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
&quot; a successful hit by Thomas Müller , with FC Bayern created the way to a earn 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus , and then ran it . &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze brought a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; by Pir@@ ae@@ us .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their final play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympics in a hot atmosphere thanks to Mül@@ lers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and I@@ ts hits ( 8 . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth stage success story will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola is finally trying to get the fet@@ al potential for Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller was sent to the Champions League at the Champions League for the Bayern @-@ Gui@@ ded Le@@ aid of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who was going to pass one as Flanders shot of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 3@@ 6@@ 88 as well as the Munich and Munich . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without shine . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ raeus has won six home games in the royal class , among them against known clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 he stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europe Duel@@ ists with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ ageous , for their vig@@ orous effort , but often to cap@@ ital@@ ise works . &quot;
the attacks were cul@@ led too often per turn @-@ back on the link @-@ outside of the Douglas Costa . Omar el@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i was often passed away against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Mu@@ eller had left the right of luck , when his flan@@ k struck the right @-@ field in the left upper part of To@@ re@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;

&quot; even though the Bayern insi@@ sted their usual game , Pi@@ raeus &apos;s sti@@ ff@@ ne@@ che could set . &quot;
but Manuel &apos;s keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was leaving .

&quot; in his first switching , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the imp@@ aired le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came too late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear , 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ rons , Müller served one better . &quot;
before the game it was in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ everyone .
&quot; after a smaller group of partial periods of Bavaria @-@ fans in their spectators blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of the host Pir@@ ae@@ us with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces entered into force against the Munich followers . &quot;

&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smoked , harm not only the lung , but also the teeth - that puts a long @-@ term study of Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; the good news : when consuming too , the risk drops rapidly . &quot;
smokers must have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is evident from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth at an time to 3.6 to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
the researchers observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes of teeth are cav@@ ities and inflammation of the gum , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; in this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors . &quot;
&quot; thus , the link between smoking and tooth loss go back to frequent gum disease in smokers . &quot;
&quot; not clari@@ fied , however , the risk of c@@ aries is also increased . &quot;
&quot; if you heard smoking by smoking , you could reduce risk of developing a short time within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could last more than ten years until the endanger@@ ing again put back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first aut@@ os@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must im@@ pose men out of it , non @-@ smoking , student manager H@@ einer Bo@@ at of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoke cleared the lifetime of life . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge also to a good dental health till the high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years affected by g@@ un@@ less@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking rises the risk of early tooth replacement .
the new long @-@ term study cle@@ ars the findings .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over the TT@@ IP new court
&quot; the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system , aimed at the determination of the dispute over the proposed trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private complex devices for disp@@ utes between corporations and states must therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to much more traditional dishes in its functionality . &quot;
we want to set up a system that the citizens dare , &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström when I was introducing .

delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him , a fli@@ pchart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dated Fol@@ ks@@ cher recorded the picturesque American state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by the Stev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
&quot; he rel@@ ates on the basis of various places that he always records on the map , wor@@ r@@ ying about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were created , and how it looks like there , in his homeland . &quot;
since then Stev@@ ens has been demonstr@@ ating as a wonder@@ fully creative person .
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever composed songs that finds itself harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always dri@@ fts out at any time . &quot;
&quot; it is a rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a crow@@ ned series : each of the 50 US states that should be cons@@ ul@@ ted in a row . &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine @-@ proximity already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and breaks positive certain expectations .
Stev@@ ens is reduced here .

Stev@@ ens then serves to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , and is very extensive . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but of programmed sequences or beats , and plays with all the effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are led to the colourful spectac@@ le out of Neon @-@ forehead , and a fluorescent stage of fluorescent . &quot;

&quot; even though there were nearly 2,000 guests gathered in their chairs , the Stev@@ ens turned off back to in@@ tim@@ acy and to folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
the audience is heard : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one could throw the &quot; sla@@ b in essence . &quot;

Jeremy Sw@@ ab@@ ns &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
&quot; since its vote , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been eag@@ erly awaited by the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , aims to give his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and has created David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ b@@ ying will rise to the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after lunch , with his performance by the media probably and the Labour M@@ EPs will be evaluated . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave colleagues to them .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test to be Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because after being named as a member of the shadow , and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , in the meantime the decision of the Labour Party prov@@ oked on Tuesday during the liberation of the national an@@ them with a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and at the centre of several cover pages in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention . &quot;
&quot; as a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ l , he had stood &quot; respec@@ tful silence &quot; and he held the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in , Owen Smith , told the Labour Party at the BBC Two news program , he got the Labour Party , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve as a leader in Mr Cor@@ si@@ ns , and they are appe@@ aling to differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parliamentary Party were supported him as a leader . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be stacked within Labour &quot; subject to the European Union and the limitation of political differences .
the TU@@ C conference said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Labour changes in order to remove the entire idea of a limit .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pensions , Mr Smith said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , with David Cameron , since he &apos;s T@@ ory leader , over the Disp@@ atch Box over the last decade of the Disp@@ atch Box . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , promised to publish a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ atively , and that he is under@@ taking &quot; com@@ bu@@ stible &quot; and that he has under@@ gone severe problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people instead . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minist@@ ries will be represented , if he is not taking part , for example , if Mr Cameron is abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea to conversation , that other colleagues might occasionally grab the word , and that he asked John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leaders in 2005 he said Mr Cameron , he was to let him remove from politics in style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the findings of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he acknowledged that he failed . &quot;
&quot; when they were broadcast on television first in 1990 , the survey was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of a leader in the under@@ house and his position under his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a caric@@ ature and require a far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the Po@@ unds rose jump according to data , which indicate a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel , the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the prayer target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses came in the UK by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the same period of the same year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and produced ass@@ ess@@ ments using interest increase at the time of 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v arrived .
&quot; one transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and will bring together brands such as Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ ito , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts newest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reductions .

J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sport@@ swear company was reported for the half @-@ year pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the hand@@ bags of the potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that these purchasing power become the higher labor costs by his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could also meet expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

the Peg@@ i@@ da poster brings to the potato @-@ ön@@ er idea .
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in fact he developed in the potato cro@@ wning owner of the Ol@@ den@@ burger icons of Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ i@@ da Movement , Al@@ h@@ ay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster by a Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen chance in television . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer that is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; that is a multi @-@ ult@@ an for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
Lebanese Prime Minister has now re@@ im@@ ed itself to the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , she has been protected as utility models recently . &quot;
&quot; so how much flesh and how much potatoes of the spe@@ ar contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y them . &quot;
&quot; only as much : &quot; it tastes better , &quot; he finds . &quot;

met@@ cash starts ground @-@ breaking campaign for fighting al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor strength campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di &apos;s opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets will enhance their relationship with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through the mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events like Adelaide . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers , sam@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A stores , and shop owners who sell served tickets for the South Australian football section at loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be published further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , if the whol@@ es@@ aler being tra@@ ded on food , alcohol , and tools through its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much about the game , since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and higher profit mar@@ gins of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ aser in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ isch provincial , and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts expect Morgan Stanley that Al@@ di takes away about five percent of food market in these two States twelve months after opening his first markets , and is mainly driven by all existing actors , but mainly independent sus@@ pensions . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analysts &quot; Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley is estimated that IG@@ A retailers can lose 360 $ million revenues each year and will lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and food market and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost met@@ cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Meta &apos;s market shares in Eastern countries , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley is thinking that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will reduce sales in the food and market at 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and a market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is probably going to disappear within one decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass publicly .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has recorded last week .
&quot; IG@@ A market share has fallen from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trade , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflected the operating debt reduction in simultaneous printing on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the whol@@ es@@ aler grew , however , investing more than 150 million $ , in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths to improve their stores due to fast growing fresh foods and to deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business@@ man Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ t@@ ations and loading programs at Elan are said , and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth in four years in the year 2017 . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis network Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for its behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; ongoing storm &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise to view the President of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly said praise as criticism for its own behavior .
&quot; the younger of the talented duo , the younger of the talented duo , has always been referred to as the &quot; Special KS , &quot; ran into the lim@@ el@@ ight with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after that , Kok@@ c@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison who had to be separated by the arbit@@ rators , he said : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA has had to strike Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; last saw how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a struggle with a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet was defended , co@@ ca@@ is defended from He@@ aly is defended . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final versus the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am enlighten@@ ed , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was a bit deeper into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a whis@@ per in the US Open but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration , and I know Than@@ asi enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has been extremely good in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on and I think it deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around it , and I think he was a bit to strictly handled . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he is never respec@@ ting a problem with the other players who is working well , it &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ved it to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; he also supported the decision that C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os begins to take into account that the important decision was made on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common choice &quot; as the right to all , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ lasting solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick has reached very quickly the ascension , which people such as Feder@@ er and Murray have pointed him . he is getting up in the eyes of the public and he deser@@ ved all the criticism that he gets , but we try to keep him optim@@ ally and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ ice , closes the border , keeps refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency and war@@ med the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all that tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country , with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants arrested in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serb police with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; people , who had fled before violence , stuck for an unknown period in a country strip between the two control points of the countries and constructed tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations have increased .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vering above them , the Mig@@ rants &quot; consolidated the border ! &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian dep@@ loy@@ ments . &quot;
some were rejected by protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said that migrants from Hungary would be sent back to Greece , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece would arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and does not harm a coll@@ ater@@ ally .
&quot; there will be talks to Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian Serb border had a day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ blo@@ c could not be made a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they convinced that the next month or until the end of the year - would be an agreement that the EU countries would take more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria sought a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .
but Hungary doesn &apos;t have its hopes for an early Brussels action or its neighbors .
&quot; the Not@@ ice who rested on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities made more auth@@ orization to the crisis , so they could exp@@ end streets un@@ lock and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ net said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire located along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having closed a fence along the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners were used in competitions , the bar@@ bed wire @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Hungary became a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became an entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees that are looking for a better life and non @-@ war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed around midnight in Hungary , crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high Za@@ uns , to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to prosec@@ ute a criminal record for convicted traff@@ icking . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation formed by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 others were already lowered into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over , inj@@ uring the fence , they are now in custody to , and are accused of off@@ ences for the new laws . &quot;

election @-@ 2016 : led by Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders at national pol@@ l
&quot; the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nomin@@ ation at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton thus has support 47 percent of the strong voters in the elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced if he is acting for the presidential candidate , receives assistance from 15 percent of the voters &apos;s democratic elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are the same as the one of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost some profit in a number of demo@@ graphic groups during S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and bri@@ ga@@ des , but these le@@ aps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support for men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are just behind with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit of democratic elec@@ torate under the age of 50 has become weak@@ ened , and they and S@@ anders are now on equal height . &quot;
but Clinton still has a big lead in the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton used to be a double @-@ digit advantage in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half the democratic elec@@ torate of voters were nation@@ ally stressed , they would support him with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party . &quot;
one neighborhood would support them with some reserved and another 15 percent would only support them because she is the can@@ did@@ in .
six percent would not support them .
&quot; perhaps not surprising , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her . &quot;
the views are strongly mixed with the one who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would it enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support them .
&quot; whereas 48 percent of the voters will say that they wanted to support it with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this on its top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question is asked why they want it is the most common answer , that she is the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by a woman that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to dealing with problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president thro@@ ws an potential for the presidential palace , 57 percent of the voters want to see it in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when Democratic Vot@@ ers are asked for the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is on top . &quot;
&quot; by Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half of his followers tell us that Bi@@ den would have been a second choice before S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; however , Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ ct the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic elec@@ torate , Clinton receives the best chance to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important than candidates , Democratic Vot@@ ers mention answers about voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no only democr@@ at@@ yan candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate is un@@ acceptable . &quot;
&quot; with some important characteristics , the Democratic candidate and potential candidates destroy good results in the election of their party elections . &quot;
&quot; Clinton consider S@@ anders , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is the best leader in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ ton strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of the Democratic Vot@@ es do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , double as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion about him . &quot;
&quot; Democratic Ele@@ ctions of the elections are generally speaking , Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s questions on Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and serving as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic Ele@@ ctions of the elections are not satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions cannot be affected altogether . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion of this was March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , though 36 percent said they had deteri@@ orated from her opinion . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered genu@@ in@@ ely and trusted in the voters of their party as honest and trusted , it is still a problem for them in registered voters : only 32 per cent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of those entitled to vote will not keep an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled voters are not honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes in the lead . &quot;
&quot; of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority of them seems to be honest , but as Car@@ son did not have any opinion about him . &quot;
the error rate for the sampling of 351 re@@ voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son stag@@ n@@ ated at a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is close to the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; by both candidates , half of the support of voters are lost in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can elec@@ tors do not support refugees in large numbers . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son pushed up from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
&quot; the survey found that Car@@ son was good on demo@@ graphic groups , thereby exceeding Republi@@ can elec@@ torate with university education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio governor , John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is the deepest of the month , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , comes with 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the error margin for the sample of 3@@ 76 people of rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son rises to the p@@ olls , with 19 % support for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support . &quot;
&quot; according to ABC News / Washington Post , Tr@@ ump also showed considerable evidence . &quot;
&quot; at some point in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some pit@@ ations for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son accounted for himself to question inn@@ um@@ ps faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday while a campaign performance in Io@@ wa . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood have been bur@@ dened by a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder of five people will be submitted during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains . &quot;
&quot; the members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory rit@@ ual on September 2013 and delayed its transportation to hospital , which has contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ ck@@ sack full of sand and was repeated , while trying to pursue a frozen field at a time . &quot;
&quot; finally , Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , and then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood had not called the call number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited once an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to search his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to make advice , said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide , and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in general about the &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; police label Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning . &quot;
&quot; after a self @-@ predi@@ ction report , Den@@ g repeatedly has been attached to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the S@@ ik@@ ery of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the S@@ ik@@ anas , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step of authorities is very important . &quot;
&quot; a County Grand Duke of Monroe recommended for murder of murder , for the first five members . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with racial attacks and education of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take part in the involved people , but if there is an organization official - officially or un@@ official - this is officially declared - we will also lead to ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; says Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood rejected its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; a rate hike is coming , and the house will lead into the wan@@ ing , end@@ ite for bonds , and the economy will lead into a recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the story offers only little manual for the economy . &quot;
a recession followed within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at lifting the interest rate is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are respon@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; as a result , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank therefore insi@@ sted that investors must not concentrate on how it begins to increase interest rates , but rather at the time that is required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables are playing a part . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could see that all the f@@ uss might be exagger@@ ated because of a zinc threat . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message of customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest at normal heights , but still on low level , to the seis@@ mic shock , which many seem to be afraid . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of business could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the removal of zinc deficiency may make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; once the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to be accounted for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps again reflected the de@@ cel@@ eration in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a recent study on what had happened to interest in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate of interest , quite flat in the 250 days after an average yield of 14.@@ 4 percent , then back to normal level after 500 days , with an average return on last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares would continue to occur later in the enh@@ ancing course later and the return on it begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essive , rec@@ essive and zinc deficiency are often promoting interest . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point with a zinc threat .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 people have had a nominal growth rate of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few anticip@@ ate that this will take action and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; adverse events in such frag@@ ile economic drop could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the whole year on a stake of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many str@@ ate@@ urs and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the Fut@@ ures trade show only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all of the enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to today presented in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in GDP and pre @-@ Rez@@ lar@@ es were very fast placed after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile , as the market takes a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks if it change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the pension springs seem to change direction as soon as the first increase in cycle is performed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the operating cycle , bond yields come immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead , that yields are closer between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a curve of the curve . &quot;
&quot; hard @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; intri@@ gu@@ ing , Jones suggests that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; besides the price of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prospec@@ t of more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , ten@@ derness have increased , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and throughout , companies that dis@@ engage in the larger part of their business activity in the U.S. , will profit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , since increasing assets are more expensive on the global market and as well as the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares are pr@@ un@@ ing to respond three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet companies had a weak demand for each of the interest in the 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital out@@ end@@ ings and low vol@@ atility in their shares sur@@ passed their counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
&quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest rates , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock , consumers can also benefit from increasing the US dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings may see gains due to higher yields , even if experts in different opinion can take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says member of the Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the conservative member of Parliament critic@@ ised the Transm@@ itter for its &quot; absurd &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is being more grown from commercial rival is not to distinguish .
he was also targeted at BBC Music Awards and said they only quoted The Br@@ its
EP colleague Dam@@ ien Collins grab@@ bed The Voice of The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do what the sender cannot do . &quot;
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen to distinguish the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; Per@@ um@@ my &quot; and is increasingly no longer able to distinguish between his commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; being interpreted &quot; - but it seems to be transformed into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also posted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontan@@ e@@ ously named examples , where you are actually only editing what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General , broad@@ casts brought back the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to public music and education . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , that I will learn about classical music nowhere else . &quot;
&quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched . &quot;
&quot; and to give the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works in order , I also ask for important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that har@@ dener will be working to engage the audience when it did so in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which , during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport made under fire , came into the commercial rival to its feet . &quot;
the musical talent show Dam@@ ien Collins took The Voice of the Voice of the BBC - the musical talent show of the BBC who was bought from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on a special BBC manner .
&quot; he added , he wishes to find that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our company &apos;s home &quot; , &quot; if it start the next time an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exp@@ el the order from The Voice into the future or add money of the pay@@ er for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August by the slow@@ est and Black Friday may be responsible for this .
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales made three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed down in November .
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping streets were dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed themselves . &quot;
&quot; but experts say there is evidence that the online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there is evidence that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot;
&quot; if you have regard the growth rates for the previous years and back to 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian , said : &quot;
&quot; he declared that the online sales lasted three years ago , as a buyer began to take advantage of their cell@@ phones . &quot;
&quot; it was meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that comm@@ utes , and we may see that growth will be dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the Black Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for its satisfactory sales . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will start their purchases at this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some tra@@ ders had crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers would sl@@ ay for bar@@ gains against buyers , will make purch@@ aser for themselves . &quot;
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium showed that £ 5 spending had spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; some products , such as TV and washing machines , are now carried out more than one @-@ third of purchases over web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the city walls . &quot;
Muslims bur@@ ies in Mec@@ ca for a crane accident in Mec@@ ca - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the bodies of 29 dead are attributed to Muslims with the first advis@@ ors in Mec@@ ca , through the streets &quot;
Saudi Arabia reli@@ es on the burden of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that , in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury them , which were killed when a crane collapsed in Mec@@ ca . &quot;
&quot; filled shap@@ ing filled , largely dressed in white , covered the circuit with respect to their respect when the first of the dead lived their last voyage to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ ep@@ h@@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession passed on the Holy Sites , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then thrown onto the refu@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were decl@@ assi@@ fied for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of the Bin Laden thanks to the catastrophe involving 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Mos@@ ch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im ac@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , was lying on his first pilgrimage , while the crane collapsed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was born with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi &apos;s officials have already pointed out that the p@@ add@@ sch after Mec@@ ca , with thousands who continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group had not been standing for the arm of the crane , as he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arabic version of Dek@@ art , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse of the bin Laden . &quot;
&quot; the news agency covered the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the business is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man brought to reveal what was the fall of the crane which collapsed in a courtyard of the large mos@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ afi took place that later this month were gathered . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has no statements on the defeat of the crane , and their representative were not available for a position . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also led the group because of not recent safety measures and because they have not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of people surrounded by Mec@@ ca ruins encomp@@ assed as part of the massive construction project which is led by the bin Laden .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over many construction projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a command@@ ing son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s family . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of high winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrims , who is at least once a lifetime required for each healthy lifestyle . &quot;
officials said that 158 people are hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
&quot; government officials urged to pay 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent dec@@ aying . &quot;
another ver@@ tex will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople are over
&quot; the British employ increasingly art@@ is@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has an increase behind him
&quot; this leads to the fact that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aiming at professional tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened &quot;
simultaneously the King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets at the country close
&quot; Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent in the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claims that British Conserv@@ ato@@ ire its H@@ amm@@ ers , and a brush in favour of the use of qualified European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out work in their home &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; for Britain , there are more skilled workers to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has already over@@ taken over services . &quot;
&quot; this is why King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , is planning to open up with art@@ is@@ ans and close at 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; she said Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight of ten buying decisions in the shop are met by women . &quot;
at the moment the men were silent at the moment .
&quot; she said that it was necessary to present itself the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ homes that are more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
&quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It &apos;s still a majority of men in our branches . &quot;

functions of a@@ I / D@@ ob about in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the regional court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Group a@@ I / D@@ ob must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and criminal responsibility .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse .
&quot; from this alleg@@ ation , he was convicted in May of final judgment . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the ICC Prosecutor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused were cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that the accused were allowed to transp@@ ose the expenditure of the United Nations in 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to transp@@ ose for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he costs approximately 400,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged for financial statements .
&quot; this assumption was based on the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ en@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to cast the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence reli@@ ed that the association was at no time a wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; the sport officials had not only b@@ illing damage charges and the sport club , for whom they had been active in 1982 until 2011 and invested some 600,000 sk@@ ill@@ ings in the debt crisis - the Passi@@ va came around 600.000 euros in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we continue to cur@@ b the club ? &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the breaking of bread , told the Treasury of the Treasury . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have borro@@ wed money , laid out our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said during the collection . &quot;
&quot; agreed with the association , you can freely manage the money , only no debt may be made . &quot;
&quot; moreover , if the financial success had been resolved to the withdrawal of withdrawal damages up to 1991 . &quot;
&quot; that is why , however , a part of the minor damages became only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; thus , for flat and non @-@ detailed bookings , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
the two def@@ endants immediately administered together and re@@ als , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the out@@ flow for the club had not been uncovered in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interested in detail for the financing industry , important is only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , a sum of 120@@ ,000 euros was presented to the club &apos;s account for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; those had been back@@ sli@@ dings , the accused declared . &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to his testimony .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
the student didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he thought he was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have knew something of this money , the prosecutor asked in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ accused was informed of the function of function .
the reference was form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
&quot; why do pollut@@ ants benefit ? , judge , judge and prosecutor . &quot;
&quot; the first accused , that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been a harm . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; You are all out of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a deputy ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the function said he has never moved down a cent level , he calcul@@ ates only o@@ dges and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; for Di@@ ets , he added 1,000 euros per month to the club , but the actual costs have been much higher than he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years have not been able to prove the accused .
&quot; according to an operating check in which everything had been judged correctly , they had no longer been kept , they declared . &quot;
kilometre was also related to the second accused .
&quot; all the accommodation may be made in cash , where he must be driven by his home village to the Bank of Rem@@ em@@ burg , in his testimony . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard cuts a further 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the ongoing activity reduction for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese , which has continued to build further jobs for further jobs since the end of the company . &quot;
the set of positions by the U.S. Compu@@ terri@@ fied Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not have an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring project , the US technology group plans to reduce the exploitation of down from 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the company will don@@ ate to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company divided on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars that will be falling from the fourth quarter .
&quot; the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed since three years . &quot;
&quot; as at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had approximately 30,000 employees . &quot;
the last publicly tra@@ ded manufacturer Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share improved by 2.3 % .

conflicts : a majority supporting the IS @-@ IS training mission
&quot; but a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be mainly based on decl@@ ining : 54 per cent said against it , 35 percent showed their votes . &quot;
&quot; other countries have air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 per cent have been positive . &quot;
&quot; however , 24 percent are against the conflict to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a collaboration with the Syrian Est@@ abl@@ ishment , Bashar al @-@ Assad , shot from 51 percent of the respondents , 20 percent would be for it . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Serbian Border Break@@ ing ( Serbian Border )
&quot; at the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ front , the Hungarian police accommod@@ ates several hundred refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ wall correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent cl@@ ump at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees cut through the border .
&quot; behind it , a polic@@ eman formed and behind the polic@@ emen came up with a water designer . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees arrived with stones , rams , and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
and the officials were first un@@ interrupted by pep@@ per@@ oxide .
the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as for the first time .
a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as has been spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was thus dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now been temporarily withdrawn .
a pregnant and obviously wounded woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the Tr@@ än@@ tie , cried out . &quot;
&quot; other refugees have lived together and suffered during breathing . &quot;
also the spokes@@ man of the Serbian police suffered serious injuries by the use of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and pep@@ per@@ mint .
time of decision on interest rates for the US banknotes
&quot; the world is observed when the US score bank on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to meet the important decision , whether for the first time ever since almost a decade the interest can be raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were interro@@ gated by Reuters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rate will remain in the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL amounted to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may go to the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , managing director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level . trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only one low inflation .
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; you have warned the markets to set up an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are against such a step . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
&quot; deaths at the Delta @-@ University , leaving certificate of debt &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he killed his colleague later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that it could not be sorry for his first murder and he could not put it aw@@ aking &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said that he had shot on someone , and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; lamb had said the staff of the emergency center , causing the police to send police officers to their home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but that no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the asking for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to do it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me loved .
&quot; following the notice of the note , Lamb approved 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police ab@@ stain@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs not@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities testified on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was given by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married seven years ago as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; O &apos; Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; at the bottom . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss has worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met for approximately three years with Lamb . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help others , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , lamb had kind@@ led relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; as police officers arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in this night , Lamb opened his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods , and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; lamb received a PhD degree from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his lifetime is based on the University &apos;s website . &quot;

&quot; Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group &quot;
the Lufthansa plans a large Group structure .
&quot; a half billion euros per year , the Lufthansa company will save you alone with a better organization . &quot;
the company &apos;s unit will cost around 1000 executives around the world to work at work in around 150 of the world .

hat@@ ch Luke Shaw by Manchester United may not play for a minor fra@@ cture
&quot; with the Champions League defeat in Manchester , Luke Shaw applied a double fra@@ cture of his right B@@ one at the PS@@ V Eindhoven 2010 . &quot;
&quot; while this le@@ ft@@ ly def@@ ending the left , he brought him out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ tat Mor@@ eno after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw was in the PS@@ V area .
it was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg as well as in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic , and then that &apos;s happening . &quot;
&quot; in the dressing cabin , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have double freight , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a mo@@ ist .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ish@@ able the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red himself .
&quot; they can judge for yourself , when I say that a mo@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account wrote : &quot; thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;ll be getting stronger again . &quot;
in relative : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ entive for the European Championship in France to recover from this coming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ coach , said : &quot; it is a very serious bre@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves with this type of injury to the place , everybody is very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our player to viol@@ ate his opponent .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a sur@@ ge , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate his opponent , and if you hear that there is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel really bad . I &apos;m sorry for that .
&quot; the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital , following a f@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot;
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s a thing that all parents want to learn soon : if your child does a book , it will not last long until you know almost familiar . &quot;
&quot; unless you are David Cameron , perhaps . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who released in 1971 , chose Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is allegedly describing the content of the book , instead gives a content in the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short origin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone , and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to see the girl of his dreams , reads , &quot; &quot; said one love inter@@ acting was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was born and that of 1991 , but is completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet suspected enough : the text of Cameron ev@@ isions to be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy called Ted , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , a girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is admitted to being a prag@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron is so much familiar with the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , speaks to a stub@@ born and stub@@ born being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ pers that the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Do@@ wning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text may probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons Elect@@ oral office .
&quot; super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ mine employees was delivered , but there was no more immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th openly threat@@ ens the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult .
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but if you have selected the Ka@@ der which has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ ing @-@ Ad@@ ult , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry a sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a teen positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
locally @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th leave out from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; leaving the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course to analyse as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , of course . &quot;
&quot; there were two good attacks in difficult conditions with the seven tests , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are looking forward to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question@@ ings at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nomin@@ ation , there - and I said this to her own best choice . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , when he hits New York for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss comm@@ ended his position , even though he did not provide such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question of how much time is a test screw@@ driver , to set his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - Sam Rob@@ son got up against him , while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got nine . &quot;
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and recovery .
the only accus@@ ation that you can find was that England first Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in high form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales coming in , and he is a striking man which I am high . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ cher , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in early this season when he achieved 236 people on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as they were before him , but this depends on the team competition in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; introducing the idea , Mo@@ een next to Cook , bring up an extra @-@ lap Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks , I came up and I didn &apos;t have anything against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a dr@@ um@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and that Link@@ sh@@ lands have already shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is not a number 3 for her , and there is no difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 test on the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
&quot; people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think , it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins , which raises her hands and the coach have chosen for youth . &quot;
on this tour he will learn a lot .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some smart supplements among exercising people . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the farmer from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test play could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ le of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has benef@@ ited from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the dressing cabin can bring fresh breeze , even if the news lies in line with what they said . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was awarded a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that . &quot;
&quot; indeed , some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ building do not determine the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you must remember that , as with the players dro@@ pping their jobs from the results . &quot;
such decisions are not taken to a slight heart .

&quot; my European friend , who wish to look outside in the inside of the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more whe@@ eled ministers and officials have come to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or going . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel over@@ turned out a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for it as it looks bad for it like th@@ at@@ cher like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or to en@@ forcement in 2017 .
it is also a se@@ per@@ ate force .
&quot; Poland might soon become a nation@@ alistic legal government , Spain . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will ri@@ p one leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better being used to prevent from the UK - something which they don &apos;t want to separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even plan a fre@@ eing ann@@ ot@@ ion , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s speech campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process . &quot;
the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ural &quot; and &quot; Britain has not won any value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how r@@ ott@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons as they did not in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; you are accepted to remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opponent team who had made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas in Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; with all his re@@ im@@ bur@@ ring , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; it belonged to Med@@ ley of tax @-@ advoc@@ ating attacks , telephone @-@ h@@ acked ali@@ ens and p@@ seudo non @-@ domestic , most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but noticed that if one sat at a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you should get better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he resi@@ sted himself on cam@@ er@@ ons Speaker To@@ bel , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which then opened up by France and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press never has forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ re@@ n , who gave me a friendly little bit on Monday in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he would not have time to say more for me - to repeat the boy@@ cott of Mur@@ doch fired 80 @-@ s years , a mistake back then and now . &quot;
&quot; it may take you , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position in Europe - I don &apos;t press it - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ p traditional bl@@ iss@@ ar@@ b@@ ur tendency and the wild animals of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV this week , as the sc@@ outs fought in him to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow sprung up had a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year old , when his old father worked on TV to be faithful to his Labour Code &apos; cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances , &quot; Benn@@ s expressed himself - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and M@@ EPs on Monday evening after all reports . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n doesn &apos;t want to mediate , remember that he has even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free map to Europe , which allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in refer@@ end@@ ums to su@@ i@@ bility , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ si@@ ns fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite economies , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion in the left dis@@ sidents , to which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ et is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to the outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin turn out political capital - they have also mis@@ guided voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this could be po@@ int@@ less ?
&quot; the United States were quite disappointed of the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power that I was remin@@ ded on Monday of something which was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the public health insurance report about e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et , joined the Lanc@@ et by implementing the public Health England ( P@@ he ) report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report . &quot;
&quot; he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; in the past month , and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have asked the power handling of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industries .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind foundation &quot; based on the P@@ he its most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the alleg@@ ations are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the University of Liverpool and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on proof of its effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public estim@@ ation expects the statement of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful to smoke than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ critical criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to produce their opinions on the damages of different Nik@@ ot@@ ine @-@ based products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a meeting of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was to have received before British American Tob@@ acco Directive ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 subscri@@ ber participants said to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not financing , which he said after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to add them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champion , of which also specify a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
the tobacco line of pe@@ es also took part at the meeting .
&quot; the research work of the group is &quot; de@@ fle@@ ct &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
however none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director for Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said , has already responded to the claims of BM@@ J earlier . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifetime smoking is dying from his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the unique fee to the public about what evidence shows evidence and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80,000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking takes the national health system two billion a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only have a fraction of the damage caused by smoking by smoking , we meet our national competence . &quot;
BBC should leave East@@ En@@ ders and says former Chief of Channel 4
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival parties would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting service should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent through other UK channels .
&quot; they critic@@ ised the BBC to place public law programmes , probably seen by a smaller audience , in hard disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rival and stations like the BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with the BBC in his time in Channel 4 for six years . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends them , which also clearly proved by not subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the upper @-@ house communications committee in line with his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think about the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least do his production at least on programs that do not make it or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed even without subsidi@@ zation .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own product productions . &quot;
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I stri@@ ve to see how it should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give back what the former Director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal N@@ IC programs can go to BB@@ C4 as they can &apos;t measure the public , but they can claim their tasks , and they can argue , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them in a window , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot;
&quot; in the radio fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course you all think we &apos;re all thinking that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me whether this is true , because they don &apos;t use much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ liner and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , ordered that the BBC should examine its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain them . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC production would have been officially classified as education . he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should have an example to inform and enter@@ tain them in public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ ba , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful in television will be shown and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters alliance to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ son@@ ogen@@ e@@ Genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des will change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are with sound impul@@ ses , that have high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard . &quot;
&quot; impul@@ ses are working through the switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane switches that react on ultr@@ asound waves . &quot;
more to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ Genetics , which can be used by ultr@@ asound , to enable a number of brain , cardi@@ ac , muscle and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the deep @-@ brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asive method that ab@@ normal@@ ise the healthy pul@@ ses into the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; generally , F@@ aden@@ oids would not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves , which penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves are based on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves operate the opening of these icons , and enable the cells , to which they are assigned , according to a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled em@@ ato@@ des , the Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ized TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; if it turns ultr@@ asound to different creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by micro@@ flo@@ rets and transferred to worms , where they turn out the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ ar@@ ities to op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , allowing researchers to switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses on light and off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ Genetics could have some advantages compared to that technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that need to be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position inside the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound tissue should be weak and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , human neur@@ ons are temporarily attached to the ultr@@ asound signal in an clinical development for specific neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped smile of those who I made sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long@@ ish compl@@ aining about others . &quot;
&quot; most of the time I have learned , can dist@@ illed in eight simple rules . &quot;
the mov@@ able student residence is enough to frigh@@ tening up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to write : people tell whence you come from where you come from where you come with regard to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re frank@@ ly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask Questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out people who would like to figure out what you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes would be fire and extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people allow people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to them : do not remember to start the Uni with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residence train up a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally and to li@@ fel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture will allow you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship , but you have to go away so that I &apos;m getting away the energy , that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhausted from soci@@ alizing , and send him an SMS instead . &quot;
an@@ ap@@ rop@@ os anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
place the friendship with B@@ aking .
&quot; as you start the Uni at the height of forec@@ ast@@ le mania , the knock at the doors of people in order to imagine themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have somewhat baked to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a couple of personal questions . &quot;
providing home @-@ made treats is a good way to close friends .
&quot; her ro@@ omm@@ ates feel free to enter@@ tain , and will associate her face with a delicious surprise at the end . &quot;
of course it depends on whether you are a regular ba@@ it .
&quot; badly missing cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make sure people sleep to sleep when you anchor ank@@ le . &quot;
&quot; steal food , is a common crime in student residence . &quot;
&quot; of course , the cl@@ a@@ ws of chicken is an ste@@ aling , but is it take a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea even ? &quot;
check that with the dairy owners .
&quot; the chances are good , they say to yourself , even if they cook within . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your matters , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to treat them more balanced than my fel@@ lows who added your milk a deter@@ sive agent to ir@@ radi@@ ate th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should do no noise that keeps people out of sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about it to be a permanent man , but that you belong in the true meaning of the prover@@ b to people who sit in the jar . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked their neighbors , if it makes them something that makes it a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they acted to him with more loud music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she didn &apos;t leave her neighbours still two hours before leaving their own music , shut down their door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
&quot; wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would be into the same student residence by chance ? &quot;
&quot; the contrary , it would not be imp@@ en@@ sible if you managed to take a resident partners for your future sp@@ ouse if you have to separate themselves and see them every day , and may see how they bring together all shared friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot soldier is definitely not your future wife ? try at least to talk your fore@@ igner to a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its key in its not sealed room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good blow is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never spare any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
&quot; shut up their door , and put their keys in a glass of water , which you place in the freezer - but wi@@ ping your possessions to the ceiling not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all@@ ach@@ ers , Ger@@ mer@@ earned &quot;
the real estate owner Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on the Central American Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; for instance , for Refu@@ ge@@ es - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need administrative space , but also the only en@@ cap@@ tive mother and the end @-@ earned . &quot;
&quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in the interview right now , I show how to build even today and good . &quot;
thousands of refugees are p@@ ushing for the housing market .
&quot; entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how rapidly cheaper homes can be created : he builds for refugees in one project . &quot;
Yahweh : many refugees are p@@ ushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : no sustainability in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because the people remain in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also require much living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a whole , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
this is different if you under@@ take people in living sacks .
&quot; each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees are saying , it &apos;s peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be transformed easily , according to the needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 ,000 euros , without property . &quot;
that is over@@ age@@ able .
the building has taken six months .
this is reasonable .
does construction legislation make their plans complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : building permission to have gone through my project .
&quot; particularly complicated , it always makes the dro@@ pping Dam@@ aged , special construction and pitch control order . &quot;
grey is cre@@ epy .
&quot; it will still under@@ take , who manages three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is lacking enough space .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there was that accused me of creating luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not right .
but do not tigh@@ ten the compet@@ itor for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true : we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but they were made the luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , including normal people as a living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only inherited mother or the end @-@ deser@@ ved . &quot;
I show how to build and build well today .
that is why it works .

&quot; iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system , if Apple update is released &quot;
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install . &quot;
&quot; some are sc@@ aled after the installation , as they get an error message that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are recommended to wait to either wait until the attack goes back or try to update over iTunes . &quot;

&quot; witnesses are looking for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ oral : Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 pm , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old communist , followed with the police his two friends , at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .

Dr. Frank Müller continues to take practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen .
&quot; also seed @-@ maker Bernd Bor@@ mann , business support in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hen@@ fried Kab@@ bert also . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , physicians and As@@ endorf are missing : Dr. Frank Müller will take over practice in practice there on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen has reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing next to his successor in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October and invested 3@@ 10000 euros to the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympath@@ y at first glance , when the Fel@@ low had met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing her training in the hospital , which is currently completing school in practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit in good practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller &apos;s wife enjoyed the idea of completing his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; proximity and continuous contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will see his own head soon . &quot;
&quot; and so , one was intri@@ gu@@ ed , the tr@@ ash bought the house with practice . &quot;
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; up there , the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up and his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical surg@@ eries and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed leader in Die@@ ph@@ olz and is honored at the DR@@ K @-@ read@@ iness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19 , practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sen@@ ausen serves as a resident , his wife specialized in Ur@@ sel ( interpre@@ ting ) on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mül@@ lers , both interpre@@ ters , want to settle down as in@@ denti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the final os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examination as well as long @-@ term - and load @-@ EK@@ GS offerings .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
a grant of € 50,000 is given the Mül@@ lers in the framework of a support programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued &quot; , &quot; stressed seed @-@ citizenship Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come to practice Fel@@ sen@@ ausen in practice , according to Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l each quarter , in the average German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
there is another house practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive effect on practical participation by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remained in As@@ endorf according to the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no sequ@@ el had been found , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; if you have visited Mu@@ eller &apos;s talk , he continues to look especially in confi@@ ded faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and puri@@ fying the cleaning force of the rock . &quot;
&quot; with their farewell in As@@ endorf a era , at least the physician have pract@@ ised there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; remembers Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness disp@@ ers@@ ed her after the long time already .
&quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are still often seen , &quot; says the Princess . &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; until now I have always de@@ pressed about garden work , now it could become different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple got two grand@@ children and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are carried out on our southern border also , &quot; says interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make an application for asylum , is evident &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it takes significant signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept cont@@ act@@ less migration flows , nor of the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously informed , even Slovenia wants to travel in direction to Austria and Germany and also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too . &quot;
&quot; not so this , the Minister for Internal Affairs , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the surveillance of the border - mainly to Hungary - intensi@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an outside of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slo@@ veni@@ ans wants to complete its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government ha@@ sted , the first refugees tried to arrive in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid the registration . &quot;
it was able to adopt the Croatian police in the nearby corn@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police esc@@ ort police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; primarily , there are mainly Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children . &quot;
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country participated with around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bus@@ ses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would also close to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that previously diver@@ ted migrants to the Hungarian border , to Croatia and reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade meets , however , that it was to take human beings in way to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do that , &quot; &quot; it was . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id had arrived in the early morning , in the course of the day , further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; across Croatia , Slovenia and Austria &quot;
&quot; the passengers were the entire night of the Maced@@ onian border crossing through Serbia , some 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has arrived , so the police said we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , it could actually be the prec@@ eded shift in the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities to border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic previously pointed out that his country had prepared plans for the fall of a strong state stream of refugees . &quot;
he did not define details but he pointed out that Croatia became a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities to control the border control . &quot;
keep strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been doing this since 2007 , and the EU partners have since then passed a good witness to the country , affecting the standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side stuck behind the Hungarian border , around 300 refugees are still stuck . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border trans@@ itions suffered from Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves are to travel to the Croatian border , it is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Minister of the Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ania was trying to calm at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he will stop the debates about alternative routes , after the Hungarian border is closed , for early spring . &quot;
it is currently not possible to take on extremely high refugees .
&quot; one could not say , whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers - migrants - Alternative alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already begun to distribute the refugees maps on which alternative routes by Croatia are drawn . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , it is still not ro@@ uting mine fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police found that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is said to have listened to a ring of cy@@ ber@@ tus , which is accused of un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites like Business Wire , Market@@ bl@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the exploited information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were fired . &quot;
&quot; current comparison shows that even those outside of our provincial borders are ultimately caught , &quot; it says in the SEC communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accus@@ ations continued in the case .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are expected to operate in both the United States and Eastern Europe as well .

&quot; hence , this approach to the 20 year @-@ old would be good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to speak openly to the tablets , however , is comprehen@@ sible to finally do a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is still subject to Tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ itals in the last few years has contributed much to that people will open . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex @-@ results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the runners @-@ gi@@ ant lowered his prize over a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boy@@ friend service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for their holidays . &quot;
&quot; last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot;
the share fell slightly more than 2.5 per cent to the Pre@@ market trade in 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. told you to earn a gain of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in financial year , which ends in May , 20 cents less than in earlier forecast . &quot;
analysts were expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will be on average in 4.9 percent and on 4 January and despite the higher supplements for bo@@ b@@ outs of heavy and large packages that will be le@@ vi@@ ed from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that the result is expected that compared to the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher revenue , and because of growth in online shops . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will produce solid earnings when weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for school employment have been announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to set 90@@ ,000 to 90@@ ,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex made $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of T@@ acks investment research asked analysts predicted . &quot;
net sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in the international priority ship@@ ments to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in his unit Express Shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has improved the results for Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit posted higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings fell in freight rates as a result of higher earnings . &quot;
&quot; wholesale trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of losses for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;

&quot; and this third term , the X @-@ factor may be in a decision to predi@@ ct them to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the close @-@ term interest rate from the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already more careful tra@@ ed representatives to increase this vol@@ atility by the increase of interest in the treasury - and be it only by one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; apparently the labour market and inflation in first instance will be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of Economic Policy at the Mak@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which guarantees the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
&quot; but the financial markets are expecting a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key @-@ inde@@ xing plate , which only represents a 30 % chance . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists conclude the blow as they promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday the Dow Jones achieved average score of 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations found that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the phr@@ ases at this point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in case she does , it would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not fall into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a rate of interest would calm the financial markets , because she would remove the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; one month before a month the F@@ ed seemed to increase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow con@@ stri@@ ction of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen were in spring and early in early summer , that in this year , despite the problems of Liber@@ als , more economic progress would be needed , an increase of the pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement was solid during the job market this year . &quot;
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month ; the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels that the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
wage increases are demonstrated signs of a recovery .
&quot; despite the inflation of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason would be the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them on the job market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world got together at the end of the month after China had upgraded its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial at average fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would slow down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market re@@ covering something in this month , the Dow is now about 10 % below the St@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , the market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculation when you should increase interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy did not appear in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US music bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he pre@@ dicts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making decisions . &quot;
but in the end effect the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was huge in recent years .
&quot; the she@@ er reference of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could gr@@ asp their monetary expansion . &quot; it also dissolved the globe around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined in the markets and economies , they are not only expected to monitor the developments at other places , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding for the global economy . &quot;
&quot; the decision of decision is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements , that apparently , with the economic foundation of financial foundations . &quot;
&quot; h@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , devoted to a interest of interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ tivity by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions entitled &quot; &quot; to reduce the growth in the United States &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed Representative started these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should not only place aspects of financial stability during a heavy crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il should not come near to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; surely she doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation , in which they fear of a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still does not contain the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that has been modified , I do not believe that it should be time expected . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : minor tourism aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of the volunteers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole number of people who support unlimited asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with her body and soul .
they still teaches with their 74 lungs as well .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , there is completely different classes than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
&quot; the Brazilian President SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women in sho@@ cking ways , how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation time . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted in breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of protein , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a powerful immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake would not be the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; according to a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet involves pregnant women who protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can ad@@ ver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
&quot; the Municipal Council , Bern@@ ard@@ ent approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall . &quot;
and he was an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar plants .
the plans for the long @-@ desired gy@@ mna@@ stics building at the Bern@@ ol@@ ina sports grounds are step forward by step forward : in the latest common ground generation was her@@ ed@@ itary construction application without large discussions .
&quot; prior to this , the body also had a request for the implementation of a valid &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; there was permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot;
according to this a &quot; semi @-@ roof &quot; with non @-@ mit@@ es first and roof over shall be built .
&quot; background design is planned for the use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; this will get a wonder@@ fully large southern roof , &quot; Mr Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger stated in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the Liberation , again , the liberation movement , for energy reasons , declined slightly different than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the hall is therefore significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction had no &quot; exceptions &quot; to the roof incl@@ ination , whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council normally falls into restri@@ ctive for liberation applications . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not include a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says Sta@@ berger . &quot;
the gym of the sports centre is a joint project for the community and S@@ V Bern@@ lo@@ ried .
&quot; at cost , some 2.3 million euros are generated . &quot;
grants are expected from the training and lat@@ itude transport .
&quot; next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter hall will now be submitted to the head@@ land meeting . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ stre@@ berg Hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district court , which confirmed the Land@@ r@@ ations Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , the Supervisory Board intends to decide on a decision on the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; plans should be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees were employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ stre@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the far existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees who can not have access to Sch@@ ong@@ au is to be offered at a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim . so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; triggered the change from the resignation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the beginning of the physician of Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic , and is now moved to a private practice in immediate proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question asked who will succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came out in the game which began to take over leadership and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this meant the &quot; appreciation &quot; and spread of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer said with his team , when the Supervisory Board decided to decide both houses , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ader@@ ship , which still has 35 beds , will definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ stre@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the district planned to have been planned for 2018 , when it is currently running in ongoing development at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; meeting in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also the chair@@ woman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Constitutional Court , will be used as an accommodation for asylum . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll close this . as it goes on to the property , J@@ och@@ ner &apos;s White was unable to say that there are several refle@@ ctions . &quot;
at present there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric illness .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; said Fischer at the Qu@@ ha@@ zi Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch , who had been fully accepted by the employees &quot; positively and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where fishermen works for over 30 years .
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again from closure , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;
in the evening of the Rhine @-@ Neckar lion this evening ( 20.@@ 15 clock ) was called on the mountain@@ ous HC .
&quot; in Wuppertal , the ranking of the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga was certainly the clear favorite . however , there is no occasion for the vote . &quot;

two Tra@@ ctor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn crop in the afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the aber@@ ration at a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters in use were in action like the police . &quot;
&quot; after a gun , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;

&quot; a crime of crime has led the police to glue who had been missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate , since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the interro@@ gation , the 20 year old studied to have killed the young people and thrown into a canal in a channel of rock breaks . &quot;
one has been missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate for a victim of violence since Saturday .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosecutor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a deal of digest@@ ion , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old also considered a person who had the fact that he insi@@ sted and investig@@ ators led to the findings of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was previously reported on Sunday morning , after they had not arrived at home on the eve after a visit to a festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in search of young women , investig@@ ators identified first on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in case of un@@ question@@ ings in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old has surrendered . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the arrest , the authorities were interro@@ gation and interro@@ gation by the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and have placed the body in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be guided by the port on Wednesday , and the investig@@ ators wanted to give him a total load . &quot;
&quot; in fact , with the circumstances of the circumstances , the further investigation should bring . &quot;
refugees need accommodations : study warns of r@@ attle
the situation on the German residential market is sharp .
there are also more refugees looking for a affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing estate is facing a challenge .
the distribution plans on the German housing market have begun long ago .
&quot; with the approaching refugees and jobs from the EU , more and more people are ushing onto a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compete with income citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; to cover demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this result , a study commissioned by the Association of Con@@ federation &quot; Social H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; this means 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many are kno@@ cked in the housing market and lined up in front of the apartments .
&quot; however , according to the Federal Office of Statistics , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent in the last year . &quot;
but the negative development of the housing market is not only a large number of refugees .
the study also makes significant fluctu@@ ations in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany : a residential settlement before turns out to be bigger from year to year .
&quot; in the ball@@ room areas there are already around 77@@ 0.000 living units , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many working inhabitants stayed in major cities in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults were left un@@ intenti@@ onally upward in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in major cities , the number of square metres per capita has decreased for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot;
thus new inc@@ enti@@ ves are supposed to boost the construction of social housing .
&quot; thus , the government tax could be wai@@ ved and the basis tax for funded homes could be exposed . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to the Alliance attractive fiscal adjustment possibilities . &quot;
&quot; the sponsor@@ ing programme for refugee business , Kf@@ W heads , is already good at towns and municipalities . &quot;
a good week after the start was announced with 184 million euros a week already more than half of the € 300 million available on Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia at the corridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no longer a passage , since more refugees always choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces itself to provide a passage from Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia plans to communicate with neighboring Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked about the Sloven@@ ian Minister for Internal Affairs , and when it &apos;s necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after be@@ ating the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees had broken into Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television broadcast live . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees at the day before .
new laws which came into force on the same day are superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; you can pass through and we are preparing for this possibility .
&quot; those people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who don &apos;t want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first fug@@ iti@@ ves at the Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after her arrival , they would have tried to reach on foot about the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees are not bor@@ f@@ ences . &quot;
the boundary of other dangers : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war during the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ield will now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hung@@ arians , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police ra@@ ced 3@@ 66 fierce people .
shortly before the door of Tor@@ que on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws have the over@@ coming and damage of the border with an off@@ ense .
35 criminal proceedings instit@@ uted in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years of prison and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sa@@ i &quot; in total 94 asylum applications have been made on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - in the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees hanged .
&quot; practically no one has a view in Hungary , or granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
&quot; before the &quot; transc@@ eiver &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
workers began to ren@@ ch up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish one to leave the tens of thousands of people during the last weeks at the edge of the road .
pl@@ illes gr@@ illes were destroyed and one of the shooting store@@ houses in the border was rebuilt .
no one would express itself to the goal of this building .
Austria is only reaching a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants continued to settle in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany . &quot;
&quot; the train service , from there to Germany , was stopped by the German authorities in the morning . &quot;
&quot; in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot . &quot;
Mayor of &quot; rocks &quot; crossed over the border
&quot; after the bridge focused on Sunday with the spaces , ten people suddenly saw with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ ity mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists changed by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany stopped on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so mag@@ ler , who offered immediately his assistance and ran ag@@ grav@@ ated along with two further hel@@ pers and whose cars crossed the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had the un@@ trusted guests only once , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
we have just said we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; for us , this was self @-@ evident &quot; , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man had not taken it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the chassis passengers were on Sunday evening , Wels , a train hit by Pass@@ au on Sunday evening , to follow it after the short @-@ time pro@@ clamation that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , yet to attempt to interv@@ ene . &quot;
however the regional train was put down in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ ste@@ es combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , before a two @-@ bridge sporting event organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; today , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now send another Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us , is a logical result from a seem@@ ingly sacred politics : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke warehouse , in order to help establish structures that ensure Human@@ ity , our Chancellor has officially embra@@ ced the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ geous &apos;s policy are not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the poultry industry also must be aware that the &quot; yel@@ ob@@ ese country , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing as a further refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; there will be a major challenge , given to the persistent refugee flow and the near winter , to establish a decent condition for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater in Austria - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter@@ ing Qu@@ arti@@ facts
Konrad has fully carried out every hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word in weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the first public centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad , had already won the grip . &quot;
&quot; we do not have any homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday after Austria was carried out without large work , commented on Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; Meister@@ leistung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry spoke , however , by a &quot; cra@@ cked situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Konrad , as a result of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ facts in the he@@ ur@@ ky year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , the total of 35,000 accommodation has to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are expected to provide the 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; stated Konrad . &quot;
he already led talks with the state capit@@ als .
they would have assured him even for the coming refugees to Kh@@ os@@ ere .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Scho@@ born , in doing it will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
the asylum Coordin@@ ator is also focusing on the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ ping like us . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
one also hopes to be vac@@ ant in the winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ cho@@ don@@ ors have to comply with a certain height of the holding holder or the size of the upper end . &quot;
for temporary time the &quot; security standards &quot; would have to be considered .
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior during the accommodation , Konrad , based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , which is forbidden without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
convic@@ ting force be its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no cost as they themselves explained .
their employees work to increase their number from three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz for a better split
&quot; not an opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings , such as tips @-@ Arena and design centre for the accommodation of refugees , the city Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary now , because people are currently under investigation without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for an emergency , however , more sites should be inspected for their capability . &quot;
criticism pract@@ ises the leader in the distribution of refugees within the Bundes@@ lands .
other districts have to contribute here to their contribution .
sea hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer phone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ er@@ inger ( VP ) informed the further action in the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
sea hofer had assured me that German borders will not be sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there is the appropriate limit controls . &quot;
there will be no longer any special trains with refugees according to Germany .
&quot; the protective personnel , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; in other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ sen@@ inger demanded more ampli@@ fied solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; now in Austria to re@@ define inspec@@ tions on the borders , there is a logical consequence for P@@ ü@@ b@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the fore@@ front of Germans . &quot;
the next run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard , and later to be acquired . &quot;
&quot; as early as the start , S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er has promises : &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T was invested in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; more than 30 percent of the 2700 square metres of residual area in the building are already booked , for another 40 percent give requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ is opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to buy a dog .
&quot; this project had to susp@@ end the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ it from Li@@ a Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ ben@@ market @-@ Ark@@ ade : last@@ ly , it has grown to grow in the form of another office . &quot;
&quot; now , in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop over the business , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around $ 75 of the hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is opened in operation since yesterday .
it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; but I have survived long , if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot;
&quot; the decision was decisive for the decision , inter alia , that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were driven by the idea of a company site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones that sell the brand in Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest did get the cra@@ dle of her mother into the cra@@ dle .
&quot; I am most happy about it , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so some women looking at a nice hand@@ bag in dist@@ ressed , even the woman can not answer the last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used every out@@ fit .
the e@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher made of K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest ancestors came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot;
this property also connects di@@ ver with the billi@@ on@@ aire that wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he comments on an alien host@@ ile , journalists gar@@ des or kno@@ bs will be revealed in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential candidate are plan@@ ed . &quot;
and cuts good on them .
this will also be registered in the pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ ic K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .

&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del has turned a film about heav@@ ump .
and what are the vill@@ agers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in its true style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native @-@ born woman has directed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spro@@ uts , besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would certainly live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; although there is respect to the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high @-@ German : the dealer , she says . &quot;
&quot; from the village , Tr@@ ump is coming out of the village . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later re @-@ immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ s . &quot;
the foundations of the real estate company were the first land of land in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from the tragedy : your wish to return to the home country , in the Bavarian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was then . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t accepted Tr@@ ump when he was once without approval , the director of the Institute for pf@@ ul@@ tural history and folk music , Roland Paul , explained the film start . &quot;
dump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that is in contrast to the mit@@ ory statements of the follow up .
he was repeatedly spoken by Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boar@@ der to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as is the case , it is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote back k@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement , the Americans looks more dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so ar@@ ating . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never looked at K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit for the church organ , which was generally well attached . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know whether this is good . &quot;
if those who had the Clevel@@ anders for the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been as he would have never arrived there .
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ sch@@ tok Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serie Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently f@@ wit@@ ched father , which closes up with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ cer star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result from last night responded with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
&quot; the X @-@ Factor on Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results on the evening two from The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new Quiz @-@ Show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23.@@ 000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia took 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the drop in the odds of the second evening by The Chase Australia will be confident to ensure that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to transfer the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
revealed truth ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are perhaps un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who won the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was finally covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three left girl left will certainly not give in , whether they are the one who received the last Rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we are with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before we checked out three two , you may not acci@@ dentally be given who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood with@@ holds his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left in ly@@ rical ways , why wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers be destroyed , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named both quickly - except itself - Mack@@ ay , as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ i &apos;s energies , I felt that they were fairly compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is on Earth at both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki also added . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen her along and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
&quot; Sarah Mack@@ ay believes , that she and Sam Wood were very suitable for Sam Wood . &quot;
&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay reported that the visit of the Haus@@ ar made her clear that Wood &apos;s &quot; One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw it with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m already holding on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when asked whom Wood was to choose if not she was , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ left girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL @-@ career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest for moving to the USA , and there were many other teams sent after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ on chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ si@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
&quot; some co@@ aches have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , when he lost a di@@ ver like the Aussie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League conver@@ se on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and Hay@@ ne had the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
&quot; rather than grin@@ d his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ si@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special experts coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ron@@ age and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched at a point which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings
&quot; surely , it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian financial success would have hop@@ ed for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not present worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ den contra@@ cted the shar@@ pen@@ er in his debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a T@@ ry for Queensland . &quot;

&quot; otherwise we will get di@@ classi@@ fiers in the Bavarian Ministry of Education . &quot;
the everyday occasions of the Free elec@@ torate has failed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
basically other main topics were intended .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free Day of voters .
&quot; of course , the subject of Asyl@@ um may en@@ camp the retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger challenged the establishment of a UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it did during the 1990s during the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it doesn &apos;t go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; says the Free Day of voters . &quot;
previous asylum seek@@ ers want free elec@@ torate so fast as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff in the administrative quarters that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the FW body crit@@ ici@@ zed several states that several states are not consistent : &quot; we need nationwide standards from the states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is sho@@ ving , others not . &quot;

&quot; the G9 Book must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the FW body . &quot;
we require freedom of responsibility for all high @-@ level gramm@@ es who want to do .

4 people killed after police ra@@ fting rubber on protest@@ ers in Nepal
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber @-@ fin in a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out at the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , senior official officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had assembled outside a police station , some of them cast stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air , before they returned to rubber @-@ fin . &quot;
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber ra@@ cer used in rubber , which is known to kill them , but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ als Southern Level , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ mat@@ i say that new provinces were formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to decrease their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal from the Th@@ arus &apos;s ethnic group who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; when the four great political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed by centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution is on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature have agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses during the Constitutional Court in Kathmandu , and officials said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;

now the plans for a new holiday resort at the Little Sea close to Em@@ den at the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est@@ ent , the medium @-@ sized development company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the urban development committee of the Em@@ der Council on Monday evening . &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , submitted by investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ inger went on board the management team to the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t got any questions on all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the Council and over 50 . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling donations for collecting $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double @-@ in donations that aims to bring about 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations , who should have tax@@ ies thousands of refugees trying to flee the European nations as they flee out of war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of donations for donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of rele@@ asing a manager of the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who had fled to the Kabul family when she was seven years old , over her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; during our journey there were many dark lines and bus drives , also hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I had good luck .
&quot; but as the refugee and mig@@ rant crisis in Europe are grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of € 5.5 million , to goo@@ gle@@ .com / or donated to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many were also fle@@ eing from the war torn in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya . &quot;

&quot; for slightly above @-@ important se@@ at@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
&quot; overall , the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly above @-@ important people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study . &quot;
&quot; it is too early to say , whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive not @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the deaths data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study at j@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use several methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has been proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out with people who have become ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people who have a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery - bin@@ b@@ ypass and stomach mu@@ gs - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes by people who were easily overweight . &quot;
the average BMI of which this surgery has under@@ gone surgery was from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; under it , the BMI of the one who did not @-@ surgical intervention received approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved at 36 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes slow@@ ed down completely only by one percent , in comparison with only two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also overs@@ aw the blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; at the best below 7 percent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is thought to be the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also toler@@ ate average results among the two kinds of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the Gast@@ re@@ tom@@ y Group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached larger back@@ rest in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not reveal a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study serious human being in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who underwent an Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery , approximately 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought the conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it is so@@ othing for people interested in a BMI of 35 who are interested in the process . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , without an elevated risk of death or kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we &apos;re too long to wait until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have been associated with obesity and diabetes , the reverse is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently resi@@ zed in Bell@@ etri@@ cs : a young woman , un@@ popular and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets the flock of their youth up after years , and he fell in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently released Nov@@ el &apos; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ ha@@ ke@@ e readers , as he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution in the refugee crisis in the Middle East may fly . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called on to stop violence in the home country of refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of persistent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , an ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that under the circumstances in any circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put to interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the response of West European countries in the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to rest@@ rain the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions as a true peace and genuine development , primarily through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the application of violence never has solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence , and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attacks of September 11 , and turns out that the non @-@ violent reaction of the USA moved to a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I published my dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush ; and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence , and that caused an unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold rise of consumption disinf@@ ection by children in the last 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ation centres in the United States report about an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which are highly vali@@ ant infectious agents , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , reports of revenue of hands @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years to report the control centres , from 3.@@ 266 to 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children getting more frequent to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the not@@ ebook , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children have disinf@@ ect@@ ant drinking , while some do it to im@@ press her friends or for a mut@@ at@@ y with the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube will show how you@@ Â disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents have their disinf@@ ect@@ ant mixed with non @-@ alcohol mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be dis@@ qui@@ eted by attractive tra@@ ilers of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ amount .
&quot; disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange @-@ du@@ es which are very attractive for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ant agent contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ es in very young infants can result in an alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated drinking alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ebook Center in the Hospital of Kansas , Broad@@ caster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let crum@@ p whis@@ ky , but people let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants reach within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year old girl who recently had taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the school after straw@@ berry made infections in the school was brought into an emergency step towards the treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is compulsory in an adult female , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who handled her at the G@@ win@@ nice Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to walk when it arrived in the not@@ ebook .
&quot; doctors overs@@ aw this night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and kicked off his head , said Rit@@ sch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been deadly to be deadly .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers , to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of mobile disinf@@ ect@@ ants that ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities believe that the product me@@ thanol contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was administered as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students from the fourth class in New York , to pois@@ oning her &quot; a &quot; teacher , &quot; by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says it a police report . &quot;

&quot; Mr. de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila . &quot;

&quot; D@@ eila said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had already before bad times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel exactly the way - but we have to continue .
&quot; we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
now to be used is so important .

why I be witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation took place first in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day approaches , I began to fear me . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a ma@@ kab@@ er lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected will be able to observe it with emotion@@ less .
I cannot do that .
&quot; I will sit down to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps , my own relationship with whom I have developed my own relationship throughout the months with telephone data and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh so much if we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to capture a not@@ ebook , and pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma sent me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of a prisoner , just as he wants , and you will receive access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; it acknowledged that she could have been better phr@@ ased , but she still thinks that it is false what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he wants , that an international reporter is present to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of po@@ d@@ casts which I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go to all the details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ es would condemn him to be a dem@@ ig@@ matic indeed .
&quot; but I think there is a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood , that it is not guilty of murder . &quot;
I sure it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will see him . &quot;
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
&quot; there will be other drivers , in which you can contact them . &quot;
&quot; what you get from me , what it means to see a man should die unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had allowed the bomb during an interview with rac@@ et@@ ing.com that the Integration Unit had tried to pick up his barn . &quot;
&quot; eighteen months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to give information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly be outlined in their n@@ oses because they hold me in an attempt to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the Route L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of the current CEO of Route L , and are still conscious of the company today . &quot;
&quot; does this make me feel , that it is personal ? &quot;
has the RV@@ L beha@@ ved himself and does not make people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there I am .
&quot; you may take my license to me and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say to them now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and they rush to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the adv@@ ent levels of the train@@ ers have collabor@@ ated with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt research at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching resulted in that he could put his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known through its preparation of the unbe@@ aten performance of the Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the post @-@ day treatment principle &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or tone was applied to the horse run@@ way , which over@@ threw the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is about the rules of racing sports .
&quot; I have to take over full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has swallowed up mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been so yesterday all day so much as it was .
but it was also the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race tag . a study of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy jumps towards ri@@ vals for claims of Ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy gives criticism about the tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier@@ ship favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the Ar@@ bit@@ ration of the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring struggles &quot; with his team in the qualifying finals in Sydney will have allowed Friday night to Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Bennett did a clo@@ aked note about the Storm team after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; sample &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ending the dum@@ pl@@ ings of his team , said they only concentrate on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy said that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team , however , urged him to be confident that they were worried about the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that doesn &apos;t appear again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ ve , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed anything about our def@@ ensive system or techniques all over the year . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es , and this has been the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent is there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to get used to it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny as this always emerg@@ es again to this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds of his ment@@ or that Benn@@ let St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting your game was &quot; Bell@@ amy &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team , and Wayne made that he will take care of a sh@@ it of divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that &apos;s exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you want to play when you have this type of gam@@ bl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , making it as they can play like this . &quot;
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago they have not thought about us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game &apos;s game against Roo@@ sters generated a higher profit than the game Bron@@ cos versus co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more experiments in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and doesn &apos;t require any points ?
for me there are the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet again in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team has free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with@@ holds $ 200,000 deposit on drug attacks
&quot; a man who possibly had a life sentence due to his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilos of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled after Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ o@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men detained in the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that it could not possess the whole lot and that in the Café might have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the risk of trouble at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the pen@@ al court , he lied the police to his residence . &quot;
so@@ si@@ mov@@ eable mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to get his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; Judge Arm@@ agan said . &quot;
&quot; but this alone won &apos;t be enough to stop him , not to appear , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , among the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serb pass , reports on the police daily and stopping at cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A5 at Karlsruhe : driving building breaks apart apart
&quot; during a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the Motor@@ way 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured at the Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three participating trucks had been bra@@ ked in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noted it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate from the last moment , as the police have shared . &quot;
the driving home of the accident @-@ driven plan was completely separate .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to s@@ ling pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ um used the phone of a 11 year old girl to require pictures of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone , when this slept , log into an online mess@@ aging services , from which he was sent a number of un@@ common pictures of children who were sent to him from another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages , al@@ armed instantly their mother . &quot;
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures she analysed and analysed the five pictures she was found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches that used concepts for finding an independent pictures of children .
&quot; then , H@@ og@@ g claims to the officials that he would have done it as to &quot; P@@ ant@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; handed over to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the state lawyer E@@ ili@@ dh Robertson said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he would be ad@@ dic@@ tive to people . &quot;
&quot; he said that the search was done on the computer from him , but said that it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to make pen@@ ile ch@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; after his talks with the unknown artist , he was asked to send him the pictures and he asked to send more pictures . &quot;
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said , he would have pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and she was her weeping and her weeping . &quot;
she then looked down on the phone and con@@ front@@ ated the accused .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said that the accused uses computers and play@@ station to speak with girls who , looking for a lot younger than he . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment , un@@ decent images of children on the 14th of June that year to have viol@@ ated the editions and not appeared before the court to be hearing a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;

locks soft to small border trans@@ itions to Germany
more and more refugees are blocked off the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many attempts from fear of discovery and arrest increases the people in smaller cross @-@ border events
&quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot;
along the boundary Inn between Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have been raised more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday .
they were on foot about bridges and fl@@ ashes on the German side to reach .
they are accepted by federal polic@@ emen and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; however , at the Munich Main Railway Station , more refugees came back to the German Police Office in comparison with the weekly closing of the week . &quot;
&quot; there are some 700 people in the capit@@ ol alone until 8 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : tower of Trop@@ ical tower &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the South@@ west
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n war@@ n before d@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the south @-@ west of Wed@@ nes@@ days .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure region over Western Europe , hot air air currents are currently expanding the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
the powerful depth is the runner @-@ up of the &quot; Henry &quot; Trophy which was pulled to the Atlantic over the last days .
violent storms and lightning are eag@@ erly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , up to Thursday morning the M@@ WD is still available in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ ische Al@@ b and Lake Constance , with bows from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen longer than the sun . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car drivers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA 2013 .
&quot; in 2015 , mainly movement of the compact cars are present , which are currently particularly well sold . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals are currently in high demand by the Federal Office ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( audience days September 17 @-@ 27 ) .
&quot; this year , numerous new compact models and luxury cars will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre @-@ premier@@ es for the German high@@ lands is the Opel Astra , which will stand at dealers in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann to the trade fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; with this the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry level below its biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf , starting at € 17 650 . &quot;
the current Astra is available from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
&quot; the Astra is available with a new 1,4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , the first three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra boasts a five @-@ fifth Opel Astra at first . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA 2013 . &quot;
and what is driving along with the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available in a conventional and an emphas@@ ised sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of next year , as Kom@@ bi , he is coming . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ branch would like to find its position in the heavily growing segment with the new model .
&quot; thus , the compact Infin@@ iti with its shred@@ ded lines is full in the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in addition , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) following the manufacturer &apos;s manufacturer .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not entirely new , but renewed all around is the compact class DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA 2013 . &quot;
&quot; outside the outside of the Citroën , the Citroën built a Citroën built @-@ in before all hand : the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed spot@@ light with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; at the IAA in the compact class , there are a series of trans@@ itional and new variations like the Mercedes C @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel &apos;s pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary priv@@ ilege to be accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
&quot; because of the injury of their human beings , in@@ mates are generally eligible for financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made public by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
&quot; the persons concerned may even hope for money even if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was succeeded in Karlsruhe . he was accommod@@ ated in a private cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who had been lying on free foot@@ ed according to his lawyer , was laid out in a larger cell . &quot;
his custody shall fail because of the in@@ famous detention conditions against the Berlin country .
but the Constitutional Court took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Berlin and referred the case to the renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s human being hurt .
chamber court now decides about the amount of compensation
&quot; also , if for legal reasons only a few days of dis@@ claim@@ er were decisive for the compensation , it was a failure to say it was . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be to worry about the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber now has to clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
&quot; in the past , the judges often have strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; as a result , they were only in@@ treated in April to an in@@ mate for compensation because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
human in@@ worthy is to take place in 2011 as well as the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe , in addition , confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , as a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ ding case in November 2009 , had a decent housing . &quot;
&quot; the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff , for three months , passed between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons were in headlines in the recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
&quot; prisoners are therefore kept free again for 23 hours , while the aggressi@@ veness rise , even to be@@ atings , it is supposed to have already taken over because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the justice section of justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel was not occupied because of young offspring , 19 were to be left in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to forecasts of the German Ministry of Education in Germany this year , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will be able to register one million refugees according to the signing of the German Ministry of Education in Germany ( SPD ) . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in light of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I tell you again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , convey@@ s the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different forecasts , it is estimated to be used between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Justice ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as ever built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatically emphas@@ ized , but above all at affordable rent objects : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the rent bond , and in order to apply these particularly advant@@ ageous apartments . &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euro .
&quot; much too little is the result of the pest@@ le @-@ Institut : 80 000 social housing have to be created annually , and this would have to invest a decrease of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of State are aware that there should be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 per cent of those in Germany can be employed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked about their respective quali@@ fications to help you get started out , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees but it is crucial in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the migrants , said Mig@@ r@@ ative researcher Dietrich thr@@ ill . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ ill@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour to the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that seek@@ eth asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
in society itself - mainly because of the skilled labour force - mainly the visibility is made possible that refugee flow should be made faster than access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the job market is missing German .
so far there is no inc@@ enti@@ ves of general and work @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs most frequently be convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
&quot; thus , the development of networks is the Königs@@ weg on the way to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few paid parents give their children in the Kit@@ as , it is estimated to have 10 to 15 per cent , &quot; said Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ ically , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the managing boards have in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators would rise strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - by increasing more skilled institutions . &quot;
students without German @-@ speaking teachers will be prepared for lessons in the countries .
&quot; but they are not always teaches by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack in them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suitcase from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German student organization estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ ted subjects - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ u@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude however . &quot;
studies of student could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce will not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ ers in law , when they begin studying . &quot;
the latter is basically no b@@ ah@@ ö@@ G that they do not fall under the circle of the af@@ en@@ ög@@ i persons .
&quot; Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to be a grant of B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing point has also to be closed ; Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will continue to play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should have gradually shed the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to the founding of a Islamic welfare association which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also duties .
&quot; so , the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and will be ready to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control options . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the read@@ iness to take heed to religious foundations . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could be carried into Germany too . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to engage in these conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately got their right to stay here , at times , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will continue to be a lot more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; in this way , the majority of majority shall have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - over a decade ago , an anti @-@ discrimination clause and an General Gender Equality Act . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slowly learning how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ Series showed , in the police and authorities systematically dis@@ respect the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and advoc@@ acy groups not require long @-@ term expectations and for an international agreement such as anti @-@ rac@@ is@@ mus@@ cul@@ um Germany must be reality , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally , Germany is unable to provide medical assistance to the expected refugees , by the president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery , president . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we accomplish this , &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
but no money is needed to flow into the system .
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery invites everyone to get to the regi@@ sters of health cards . &quot;
&quot; brought benefits to the federal states later , later . &quot;
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited service catalogue can be derived from the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
otherwise doctors perform the doctors most of all the language barriers .
&quot; as far as far so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved to be beneficial to migrants as well as other diseases . &quot;
&quot; not only in medical clinics , including in medical surg@@ eries , they would have taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have also been helped with more gener@@ alized medical response centers in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; in refugee camps there are much more un@@ processed people , and with the young people go to HIV @-@ En@@ lighten@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; but by her education , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes in part with the partly other diseases of the disease . &quot;
paras@@ ite attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as far as the medical don@@ ors may be possibly radic@@ ally even reli@@ eving in sight .
&quot; the Syrians have developed a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be practic@@ ed , they would have to re@@ prove their qualification and possibly over once again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates of the Federal physi@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most suffering from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress response or depression .
&quot; Africa Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K , are particularly vulnerable . &quot;
a recent study of the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth of Syrian refugees are trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
&quot; whoever is irrit@@ ated in an post @-@ trau@@ matic stress , is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong scre@@ ams and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic diseases , an early treatment necessary , amm@@ un@@ ition was necessary . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can pose a request for a psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not educated for mental illness , would not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Sim@@ s@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell on the stairs in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; it remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly beyond the social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by claims of delegates of the opposition , that they had warned An@@ ony@@ ms of death threats and warned against them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
last month they had seized him and interrupted at the State &apos;s State &apos;s State . this is what he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition polit@@ ician News received SMS messages on their cell phones that warned against Mr. Mu@@ ch to dis@@ rupt .
&quot; the message comes from a number which is not indicated , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists according to Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament warns that the European Parliament &apos;s immun@@ ity has ended , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard creates up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; in this year , HP will split into two publicly tra@@ ded companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected job sequence leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett Packard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger , when HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies during the transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual turnover and will be focused on providing integrated technology solutions for companies so far , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it is divided into a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard . the Palo Alto Garage was called &quot; The birth@@ place of Silicon Valley &quot; by the Palo Alto garage .
HP has a massive re@@ structure in order to transfer the convert from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on a strong focused company that will hold a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; W@@ enger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , when his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario means already that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss out at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great dis@@ grace in this present problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le injury , and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; those kind of injury not threatened the career , &quot; &quot; W@@ enger said . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which was not well healed . &quot;
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t in connection with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true in a medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also evol@@ ves a pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 League play in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League &apos;s clubs which have most vulnerable days .
&quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the case of injuries will take place during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a reasonable time , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it , and he will run through the way that he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal begins with the Champions League @-@ season at Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on next Wednesday and W@@ enger represents a rotation within the teams .
&quot; nearby Bell@@ in@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a little break @-@ break , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal come clear easily through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games once the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday , whereby it was measured by the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League cap@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven far from the far hope , with his management to the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this engine is immense , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked on Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friends
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is evident , especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves , now have become more desper@@ ate than ever before , like suicide among young males , on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men ranging from 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ is ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ aign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) in 2015 announced the year of man to question the culture in question , the men seek to seek help if they need this . &quot;
friendship is the heart of struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms showed that when suffering a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery had doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , it hal@@ ves a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media @-@ guided communication , with its main focus on substance , the in@@ fertility of the reply is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to seem to be strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists will call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a much deeper effect on our mental health . &quot;
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained that money may not really buy .
the nice thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his job , but by its personality , which sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents in the soccer look in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire from Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men rely on any case even if they are often back to explore fully their emotions . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of the telephone conversation , it declared to me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who would feel de@@ pressed people and at risk of hom@@ icide , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends , often . &quot;
&quot; the old Rede@@ mp@@ ing &apos; I come to right &apos; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind , when I try to offer long @-@ lasting vision mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships , too . &quot;
&quot; so very my objective status via telephone the people in moments of desp@@ air may also help you , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend of com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day totally re@@ designed scenes , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink at Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone sitting around alone , give it a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what the difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all the 236 Ep@@ is@@ ers - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
arriving to PS@@ G by PS@@ G to grin@@ d Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh Grand@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hits on Malmö .
&quot; in his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and the PS@@ G , di Maria will lead to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game report and reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Grand@@ son Cav@@ ani participated in Paris as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season , with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met just four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who raised the French master on the way , but thereafter it extended a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ lamp in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A takes Paris a strong start to the Swedish master , since they are not only stri@@ ving the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ - laps , but an improvement on the path to the fifteen final stages in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class turn@@ out of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ able gli@@ ding opportunities in front of the gate . he later became in play against his home @-@ team and against the club , with which he started his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win and look back to our opponents , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; it is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret it , we did not have scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; Cor@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury to the Paris team after a violation of three modifications to the Paris team , which last weekend was 2 : 2 , which was placed on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was dischar@@ ged in the fourth minute due to Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian lawyer was regarded as the husband , who was also accepted as PS@@ G at the next level in Europe , when he finished in Manchester United &apos;s pass behind the Malmö Defense , before he completed Johan Wil@@ and by beautifully carved in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic race in a play @-@ off struck the stage to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was up@@ set up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who went far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they b@@ alled little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G gave himself up occasionally , with some patches with flaws and bad agreements , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was in the first half of merely five attempts and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had deployed him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill if he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic to turned the Di Maria in a shooting , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally landed shortly after Cav@@ ani . at close to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had thus the sixth full of season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thought that Malmö cannot be returned to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to beat the final result before the replacement player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a fool at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later gave that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; as a consequence of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown was using this the need of alternative perspectives and in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the selected script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it in the score of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with bel@@ ated un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor taken by The Mar@@ tian decided .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to give people to think about it - who will always be the director of the Harmony , as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;

&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip , using &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks on the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - this is SO W@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ que@@ urs since its release . &quot;
&quot; at a time , Dam@@ on comments is at the exact time representation representation in the media at the fore@@ front of social discussion . &quot;

&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock at the winning price of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had for life , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap money . &quot;
suddenly very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the Executive Produc@@ er K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all at the circuit , not just any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it &apos;s one of the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life is changing , he receives the great ones . &quot;
I don &apos;t think it swe@@ eps at about a Gro@@ ll .
&quot; he is just so happy to have done , what he did . &quot;
he received awards from his fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would like to have felt like , when they changed the roles . &quot;
America Ninja Warrior has been extended with a@@ wn@@ y season and scheduled to begin fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ aking on Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ MB@@ W@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once earlier , they were once one of the top teams in bas@@ eball . today , the tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , however , this part played perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 Target Field . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wins lost a chance to climb up in a game of Houston , Ast@@ ros , for the second American League of Wild@@ card @-@ Platz . &quot;
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return to the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to hold over a big part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad pron@@ oun@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon holding his early offensive support , when Detroit suddenly scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit three times for the first 6 times and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was just his third succ@@ es@@ ful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns and his first R@@ B@@ Is in mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first three hit @-@ game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has shi@@ fted well the perc@@ ussions &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ la@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good for ( kick training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he carried it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three cen@@ time in the back@@ yard , at the end of the seventh heaven , T@@ wins took their best chance to come back into the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ d@@ Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ st@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy was running on the Berlin Wall , the only man confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the vice @-@ president Miguel S@@ ano , which was dealt with two @-@ run by the right @-@ handed . &quot;
with a pair of buyers and the finish @-@ run in the second brought Ver@@ h@@ agen the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
it was that of the major league &apos;s 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play .
&quot; at the end of the ninth inside a Insurance @-@ Run , it struck a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed leaves , however , in three pitch for the fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited to the start of the game from an even not moving Phil Hughes .
&quot; the tig@@ ers took three ranks in the first two inside vs. the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the injuries number , after having been missing a month because of a dor@@ sal . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished me &quot; , &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; &quot; but I felt better , when I started and felt that I would get some pretty good pitch out there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ LP made a single of the Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with a sc@@ oring in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , but managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which finished the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers decided on the second , a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not struck especially well , but he got the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hughes was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , and had no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the revival of the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ctor . &quot;
Hughes made three hits at the out@@ set of six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez was eliminated because of a violation of the alleg@@ ations .
&quot; he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who had operated the Sanchez &quot; shoulder in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ tro@@ t , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with Sanchez , L@@ HP Morris is kn@@ itted from the vulner@@ ability list in order to win the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the tig@@ ers , since it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 . &quot;
he joined forces in the Right Li@@ ft@@ ist since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are expected to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the most enriched people should be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 adv@@ ent refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ish capital have been prepared for this case during the last days .
up to 1000 refugees may temporarily come subject to temporary .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , we have arrived in Hessen , according to the government responsible for the ruling convic@@ ts of around 7@@ 500 people in Hessen . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au spent a large number of refugees furnished in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the horri@@ bly re@@ thinking about military action plans should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; con@@ structive direction . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was glad that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict passes at our front door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for massive increases of international aid for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria has once again established inspec@@ tions on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the Austrian minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared that no one will be sent back to Hungary at Tuesday night . &quot;
also Germany did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been dealing between the General Director of Public Security and representatives in Germany . &quot;
concrete figures were not called them and did not show talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; during the last few days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your target is mostly German .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann applied together with several other EU leaders and government a special summit for the next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a shared action in the crisis .
&quot; on next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU ministers will want to take a new inc@@ iner@@ ary on the distribution of further 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the first@@ intake and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries of Germany , in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the German Chancell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ ed the impact , those people who would need to protect them . &quot;
but he who doesn &apos;t have a lead eye could not remain in Germany .
this conception has been de@@ pressed in the lap .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or pointed out , the state as a whole , now has to face an &quot; huge strength of force . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; only a few hours later , the government in Budapest has announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat from Romania in response to the planned new border . Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condemned the Plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants arrested along the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; finds its ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond Fin@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the E@@ isp@@ an@@ zer of Saturn En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , Satur@@ n@@ moon en@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ app@@ ends a global ocean . &quot;
this will include researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; so , the moon is situated gently on his train to the ring . &quot;
&quot; this diving movement is only small but nevertheless too big for an all @-@ day sky@@ diving , it says in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analysis in the fields &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; had already discovered the ice volcanic erup@@ tion on South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon , the water vap@@ or and ice @-@ particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers included it back then . &quot;
however the extent of the hidden ocean was not explained .
Rama is missing several weeks in Munich
&quot; in 1860 , Munich has to aband@@ on Val@@ det Ram@@ ans Rama a month . &quot;
an investigation has given an ad@@ duc@@ al breach of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old divide the association .
Rama had already accused pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis is expected to take a break in four weeks . &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , Rama is a heavy loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think of course , &quot; &quot; said Sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ rest@@ n &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a unified professionals . &quot;
&quot; however , the sixth was presented as a training guest at first . &quot;
the 30 years old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently in Belgium and was also under contract for the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg .
the Cro@@ at currently has the possibility of giving his expertise under proof .
tor@@ h@@ unters Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian National Player has to enter running training .
&quot; Ok@@ ot@@ ia pushed forward in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , at a sharp equ@@ aling head . &quot;
&quot; contrary to initial concerns , he remained without a serious bl@@ professor . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and mo@@ ist @-@ sweet .
&quot; but if anyone wishes to pay his sl@@ ender line , it is often rather disgu@@ ised by them . &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits . in them B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos are much vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; who eats the fruits , thus supports se@@ per@@ ing , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when you buy , man@@ gos should not be too soft or firmly to smell . &quot;
the form@@ work color alone does not say anything like ripe is the fruit - so green man@@ gos are delicious .
they should store in room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; however , a man@@ go is a special note . &quot;
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter flavor of man@@ cher leaf salads such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney is suitable for fish , poultry , lamb and wild animals . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. service company UPS represents the Christmas business in the US , up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; the company already started the recru@@ itment of seasonal workers , shared by UPS on Tuesday . &quot;
mainly drivers are wanted .
&quot; already in the past year , UPS had its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hi@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online store , UPS and its rival Fed@@ Ex has been fin@@ anci@@ ally since previous year earlier , to be ready for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , deliveries delayed to the package services . &quot;
&quot; first con@@ cave , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night breaks the hair @-@ side of the hair @-@ f@@ ohn table , like the Met@@ e@@ os@@ ch@@ ant@@ z on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday evening and Thursday the f@@ öhn stops partly with a storm of f@@ lin@@ ers .
&quot; after speaking on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front , the powerful rainfall , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decrease . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area about the British Is@@ les in a powerful re@@ flux . &quot;
at the Alp@@ enn@@ ess site the night becomes on Wednesday of the hair @-@ dryer through the valleys .
&quot; in the after@@ math , the f@@ ohn was f@@ aked until Thursday morning in the con@@ cave with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Föhn can be imagin@@ able up to the adjacent County , and on the mountains even organs of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; during the north on Wednesday stor@@ er@@ oom for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture begins to calm down the Alpine slope . &quot;
here rain is taking a rain until Thursday nights .
&quot; in total , the remainder of the Alps has to be reck@@ oned with over 100 liters of rain per square meters in the next 48 hours , after already huge amounts of rain during the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the f@@ öhn stops the air , in a row , a cold front with thick , swe@@ at@@ ched , swe@@ ating rain from west to east through Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind blo@@ wn up strong until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are going well back . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present at the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz . &quot;
in the presence of Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino on Wednesday a previously famous place in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill was christen@@ ed on the name of the German reform .
&quot; he is now honoured with the &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature was requested by the evangel@@ ical Council of Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants could live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the place , becoming visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) worked as a young August@@ inian mon@@ ch around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he received the town then as a comm@@ ent@@ able sin @-@ label .
his negative impressions might be encouraged according to histori@@ ans in his future fight against Rome .
Luther ended with his thes@@ es in order to aband@@ on the sec@@ rec@@ y of the rus@@ sian church .
hammer Artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main pieces made by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has form@@ ulated its very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different moti@@ ves . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ anci@@ ful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adjusted the respective issues , it may well be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt let work on his Bible project , which he created a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic choice from the many different subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles have created cycles , dedicated topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fath@@ er@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; he sp@@ ends spontan@@ e@@ ously multiple partners : this is true for the Luther Publishing with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books . &quot;
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who deals on the basis of painting with the particular scripture .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible of the &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; Bible and , &quot; Today , &quot; into current Conne@@ ctions . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original @-@ Bible quote by Martin Luther , and each of the artist &apos;s sentence , which explains his very personal thoughts about the particular situation . &quot;
the cost@@ ume jewelry cord has gold stocks .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows dou@@ bly deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
it is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; finally , emot@@ ion was even a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that affiliated to the strict Protestant congregation . &quot;
&quot; then the education again took place by the pi@@ pel@@ let , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to get it up , to help me also with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second concern is to help art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of educational worlds is influenced by advertising and which is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images always have some mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt let us know that the viewer can &quot; &quot; cap@@ itali@@ ze &quot; &quot; on the images , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is seeking his opposite . &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost gest@@ ed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot; it has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like working with his paintings .
&quot; I don &apos;t have to understand the Bible completely , but they are selected for him important , also myst@@ ical topics . &quot;
&quot; that was no collaboration with eye level , &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; here we are about the pictures , the lyrics are explained only . &quot; &quot; this was a pictures of the Bible . &quot;
&quot; by Hans W@@ hol@@ iers by Luther Publishing House , this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for fittings in both the Bible ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and screens - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung on 15 November .
construction start for BM@@ X track
&quot; plans made , space found , company contra@@ cted , model design@@ ate for a circuit : one year later , nearly everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railroad was already completed . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ comp@@ ences in politics and administration were sor@@ rowing , especially among the residents which did not toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill slo@@ v@@ elled , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the permission will go down in October , and was able to announce the First Commun@@ e in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , a child and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year happened to be visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; then , without a &quot; further &quot; inter@@ mission &quot; to be started with the work of former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to the refugees from 2003 to 2019 , in the Bundesliga a clear sign . &quot;
football is respon@@ ding to the dominant position in Germany and secu@@ res the policy of making its help in managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing going on , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; it must be interested in every single interest , this subject in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he wants to inten@@ sively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Kanz@@ ler@@ amt and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ lu and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or .
&quot; then , the theme will play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football could and help .
but the turn@@ outs must place the policy .
&quot; therefore , the German soccer federation has extended its own initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Kid@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Federal regions support this programme .
already on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ f@@ one put a clear sign when they on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship Leader ( Hermes ) will help im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make sure that everyone should help them , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sports director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler and called the &quot; Image &quot; Newspaper &quot; ( Tuesday ) . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every day , nobody must be seen . &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer players , no , we need to use our beam strength , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have been so incredible , said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
&quot; for the Euro @-@ finals of Hungary on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large common German football team . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ing contracts entered into their own sites would be great .
the same is that tiny and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year and the next year , the association will jointly serve 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called all the sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Board lost an eye at accident
&quot; the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost several reports by the fall of July . &quot;
&quot; in an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he was worn at the left hand , the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s nearly dist@@ ressed , but he was to@@ wed out to the road - he tells us so tells us last week , &quot; &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; was quoted &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Plat@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager would be able to meet and are able to work out at the meeting .
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to conduct the software corporation . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was standing for the entire time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually travelling between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; anyone can happen to anyone . &quot;
&quot; it is important to rise again , once you fell . &quot;

robot@@ ic cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be the pace of technological development of technological pioneer . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday at the edge of the Frankfurt Motor Show for a &quot; new mobile era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated and connected drive will increase traffic safety and make less steel , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the theme with his counterpart , the G7 countries , and will also come together with representatives of the industry . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , st@@ resses the importance of the mobile broadband infrastructure and a generous impact on digital radio stations . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is created on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the German Federal Government seeks to check the legal framework conditions , &quot; and , &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use such an internationally that the maximum permissible speed is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vi@@ enn@@ ese Convention , which so far only sees people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; taking automated driving , the car is taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which process the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study published by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; still , driving @-@ free vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at location Germany will estimate the authors of the 2025 study to be around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic . &quot; &quot; the SPD traffic sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ kers S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l said . &quot;
&quot; the question of liability upon accidents and safety of the drivers , however , needs to be clear . &quot;
&quot; still , the Germans are still sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; one of the results of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA , come to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent are not expected to believe 31 percent at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of respondents were looking for autonomous cars by 2025 , 33 per cent in the US . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a collection of the new alliance , Bit@@ kom account , only seven percent would agree to their control during the entire voyage on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way , this could imagine only 15 percent in the flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , everyone would leave the car under any circumstances . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
it &apos;s a mixture of a very big fashion show and a watch @-@ figures gr@@ ati@@ co @-@ cable : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which makes it terri@@ fic according to video projections . &quot;
&quot; you carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others , featuring Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the big star of fashion scene - so that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair .
&quot; previously it was too light , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th in the Kuns@@ thalle of the hyp@@ o @-@ cultural foundation , it is a fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his way to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was on the other hand because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit &apos; death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you dies , one comes into the museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection had previously been in Montreal , Canada and Paris . &quot;
&quot; so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into that hardly an instant work of man who has written fashion history without ever completing a training .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ e the d@@ olls , an example of a St@@ yl@@ ist was involved . &quot;
14 tons of materials have inherited the cre@@ ators according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October Festival there was another special treat : a leather tro@@ t out@@ fit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
changing old ted@@ dy styles is also shown in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ul@@ ly mo@@ wing mercy @-@ attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and badly in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the dis@@ card of fashion did he join himself later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers alike as Gaul@@ tier was thinking .
later I bought it then .
for his first fashion show he will not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry held Gar@@ dine - outdoor tip as fashion niche
&quot; previously , it went to the long embroi@@ dery and to make pl@@ ush about that meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were made in large amount of customers , which they continued for example to ceilings and she@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; today , this alone works no more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ w@@ lers Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ener tip , fashion all@@ ot@@ ted a larger part , was then pushed through the home textile industry , and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against the past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , has an increasing contra@@ productive capacity . &quot;
&quot; if no commercial use in the textile branch in Germany , nothing is more on the market . &quot;
&quot; with us , they already make half of all contracts . &quot;
Mo@@ vers Pl@@ auen is together with nine further companies member of the association of pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover collapsed . &quot;
private trade businesses and also the wholesale stores do not exist anymore .
our products are scar@@ c@@ ely achieving our products on this way .
mass media must now be made much cheaper in the Asian region and exp@@ elled almost exclusively through chains .
&quot; in addition , the export res@@ sions are also exp@@ orting to Russia and the United States . &quot;
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also proved to be characterized by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Em@@ ig@@ ma in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a seal of quality , indicating that we are ec@@ ologically efficient and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger office of the Sax@@ on University in Z@@ wick@@ au , Germany - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips . &quot;
&quot; to meet the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; a field of tension is formed between the fres@@ her ideas of designers and businesses that need to think particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a existing design can often only be easily varied to hold a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ located the historic snow @-@ head . &quot;
the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates small cows on some places .
the pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith &apos;s master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach - she was inspired by : &quot; I was able to do nothing with traditional pl@@ au@@ ener on top . &quot;
now they use the head @-@ pointed tip for their jewelry .
&quot; in an elabor@@ ate method , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region are identified with the topic of pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; they also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , and that would like a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with that I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of pl@@ au@@ ener tip .

XI is p@@ ushing to push the economy bro@@ ader for the world
&quot; the economy has to open a wider position to advance growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping has contra@@ cted the Tuesday to a group with steering the steering . &quot;
&quot; China should encourage themselves to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how , and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central leadership group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promote new inv@@ entions to promote and promote reforms , new moment@@ um and vitality will bring in and new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of directives , including a neg@@ ativity list to regulate the market access , recovery of border controls policies , to include private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , the sectors and companies that do not come into question . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it guarantees a major role in the allocation of resources , which guarantees a legal business environment and designed the market , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will lo@@ osen controls on those transferred to the company &apos;s own powers , making companies decide how they lead their businesses . &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border @-@ border operation to explore new models of cross @-@ border operation operation and new mechanisms in promoting the regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , government controlled sectors will open further areas for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change their policy towards foreign investment and will protect the lawful interests of foreign companies , and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier to apply for foreigners , to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimized and simpli@@ fy the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their function , and to use professional judges and attor@@ neys , was also discussed during a session . &quot;
&quot; the session also attended Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders , such as Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ fishing
&quot; the European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in major pre@@ dat@@ or and represents a clearly higher dose of thr@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ood@@ le consumer organization , which is a corresponding working group of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans , risks and side @-@ side effects of industrial and environmental policy , Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt told F@@ ood@@ le . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve food should be raised to large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , so that on the basis of existing limit values , about 50 per cent of the could not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limits , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be compens@@ ated for sale . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU plans to increase the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ le described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller bur@@ dens , such as Kar@@ ps usually are so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ance of de@@ composition that helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a high @-@ quality heavy metall . mercury is particularly sensitive to humans in particular for the food chain .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; even small amounts may cause the nervous system damage caused by the nervous system .
the Federal Environment Ministry states on his homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values but that a &quot; health concern for the general population is not expected . &quot;
mercury is used by the coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of German coal @-@ em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; mercury in fish are concentrations of mercury in the river El@@ be , Rhine and Danube . &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; had passed out of the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , mercury @-@ European war@@ nings had already identified the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
