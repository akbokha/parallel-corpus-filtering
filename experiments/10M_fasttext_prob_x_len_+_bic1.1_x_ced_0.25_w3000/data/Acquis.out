&quot; containers and in@@ fusion devices are set up before shipment with an English and French label , which corresponds to the samples contained in the equipment 2 to 10 of this protocol . &quot;
human whole blood can only be sent to containers in which the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C during transport .
&quot; the preparations and devices in Part II must be ster@@ ile , ap@@ y@@ che@@ ated and po@@ ison@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the ship@@ ments to in@@ fusion , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot;
human whole blood is the blood of a healthy man and mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
&quot; C ) Not free from blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this may be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; the blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is headed by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ ing solution was filed before ster@@ il@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; after completion of blood flow , the bottle is closed immediately and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , it must be opened immediately prior to use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans@@ ing must be no longer than 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration must not drop 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously placed on hand of blood cells and power ; determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by investigation of blood cells at a new sample of the dispens@@ er .
&quot; as far as the blood group determination in individual countries are standardized or recommended procedures , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific tests have the non @-@ existing the anti@@ gens C , D , You and E . &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , the blood is intended to be used only for recei@@ vers of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot;
&quot; the human whole blood is in ster@@ ile , closed bottle from micro@@ organisms to store and keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permissible only during testing and transport necessary times , which can be reduced to a maximum of 30 minutes , on which the blood is to cool down to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood , from which the biggest part of the Plas@@ mas was removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been gained ; other blood body components can be present or can be removed . &quot;
the fluid content of the concentration is either made from the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ on@@ ici@@ ally wat@@ ery solution which was added to the Plas@@ mas distance .
&quot; however , the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells are used , thus the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the manufacturing processes must be carried under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . sealing must be done under use of ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively through pressure . &quot;
&quot; since then , an artificial aqu@@ eous solution has been added , so the label is also to be put to its volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through drying of the liquid , which ab@@ uses at cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging or se@@ dic@@ ation of human whole blood . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through refriger@@ ation , or any other method , which is avoided by den@@ ying the proteins . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can be easily dissolved in a water @-@ quantity , which corresponds to fluid level , from which one went out to produce the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentrations of the so derived solution may not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution may not have a visible sign of sh@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) a dangerous content of is@@ oh@@ em@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ or@@ glut@@ in@@ ine have been identified .
&quot; if the plasma is shu@@ ff@@ led and frozen within 48 hours after the blood flow , the ster@@ ility must be detected in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to turn the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood don@@ ors , the characters of a bacteria @-@ contam@@ inate are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to decrease the risk of transfer of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ she@@ ep@@ itis , are to reduce plasma cutting @-@ st@@ resses which do not apply more than 12 donations or to apply other methods , the most known masses have been reduced in a similar way . &quot;
&quot; depending on the production of the plasma , corresponding water quantity should be added , the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 ° . &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which was produced by the fluid level , which was produced , and the solution will under@@ go the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) If you use 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of th@@ rom@@ bin or calcium chloride , the process can be accelerated ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ step drying process in presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ d , under pressure of 0,@@ 02 mm mercury in the human dry plasma loss may not occur more than 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human drought is in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , closed bottle among any micro@@ organisms and after the possibility of protecting any moisture ; it is protected from light and keep at a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma rot@@ ein are specimens from the protein component that consist of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the human whole blood .
&quot; without regard to whether the final product is flu@@ ffy or dry , the preparation of an appropriate stabili@@ zer must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container in the final container of 10 hours to 60 C ± 0.5 C in order to dis@@ able the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ she@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in preparations , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins have to be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
in both preparations no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G are present per gram of the product .
&quot; if the end product is frozen , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the faction of human plasma is manufactured as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; as a solution , human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ ative measurements of the viscosity and tr@@ uss@@ ing , and cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging with the Ul@@ tra@@ z@@ entri@@ fu@@ ge and elec@@ tr@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , which are made before and after heating to the solutions , no signs of a den@@ ying of the dissolved proteins are allowed . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six stu@@ ds in a mechanical shooter , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The maturity tests with specific ant@@ is@@ era must indicate that there are only human plasma proteins in both specimens ;
&quot; II ) the elec@@ trop@@ ho@@ res@@ is represented by fre@@ est@@ able particles amongst acceptable and suitable conditions , it must indicate that the mobility of the alb@@ umin@@ ous component of normal human plasma has at least 95 % and in preparation out of human plasma tor@@ rot@@ ein at least 85 % of protein mass amounts . &quot;
&quot; in other preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma tor@@ rot@@ ein , sodium concentrations may not exceed 0,@@ 15 mol per litre solution or re@@ produced Tro@@ k@@ ken@@ preparations . &quot;
&quot; the potassium concentration of human plasma tor@@ rot@@ ein must not exceed 2 m@@ mol per litre solution or re@@ produced dry preparations . &quot;
&quot; the pH value of any preparation must be used to di@@ lution on a protein concentration of 10 grams per liter , with a solution containing 0,@@ 15 mol of potassium chloride per litre , at a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.8 ± 0.2 . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ step drying process in presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ d , under pressure of a maximum of 0,@@ 02 mm mercury can not occur in the dry presence of weight loss over 0.5 % . &quot;
human drought in an nitrogen atmosphere is in an nitrogen atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in ster@@ il@@ em ; sealed containers of micro @-@ organisms and to the possibility of moisture ; it is protected from light and keep at a temperature below 20 C .
