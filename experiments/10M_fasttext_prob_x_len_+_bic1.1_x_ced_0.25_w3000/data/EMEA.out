the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) presented the conducted studies to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packing instructions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; for further information concerning the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for injec@@ ting ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mis@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic illness in which patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ate with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is applied for rapid control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness or behavi@@ oral problems when oral medication is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties are prepared . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole works probably mainly as part of &quot; particip@@ ates &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l is such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower measurements when neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder plays a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of brain , elimin@@ ating psych@@ otic or man@@ ical symptoms and will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the resum@@ ption of the symptoms , was investigated in three studies by up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased ag@@ itation , compared to a period of two hours with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy received over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which were stabil@@ ised to prevent the man@@ ian symptoms with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ ing was found in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder affecting at increased ag@@ itation which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scope for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets , and the solution to be absorbed ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with the injec@@ tor det@@ achment , patients who received ab@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly stronger the symptoms of increased ag@@ itation than patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the re@@ perc@@ ep@@ tive episodes of patients who actually treated patients and if additionally was administered to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses , Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions also reduced the symptoms of increased ag@@ itation and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , anxiety , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , anxiety , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , ru@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moderate to serious man@@ ic episodes of patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l spoke to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness and behavi@@ oral problems in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the office of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily ir@@ respective of meals .
&quot; an increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not demonstrated .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patient , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify that ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction has been removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ at@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides is one of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the onset of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder showed no increased su@@ icides risk with Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied to treat patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial or isch@@ em@@ ic heart failure , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conv@@ ection disorders , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be drawn into consideration , reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y must be removed . &quot;
&quot; hence , Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in an@@ am@@ ol or at states that are associated with cr@@ isp@@ ru@@ ptions in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dos@@ ing , a significant relationship between the dos@@ ing and the response to un@@ wanted dist@@ orted events with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients that were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia related events , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients that allow direct compar@@ is@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ th@@ p@@ it , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regard to a deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effect , and may lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ a zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is offered when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with over@@ ly side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not considered so@@ unding . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) recorded the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects have , and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ition@@ ers can result common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l . compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively @-@ intensive met@@ alli@@ zation .
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should survive the potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should be similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose above the companion of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and can be calculated with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
&quot; clinical trials showed a significant impact on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ological morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
people should come to inform their doctor if she will pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the in@@ adequate data situation to the human being and due to the reproductive studies at the animal , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant @-@ side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the down@@ side effects were defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including le@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ic and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed with patients under Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another controlled study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term period of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups below Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events that occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality with older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or un@@ intenti@@ onal over@@ do@@ si@@ bilities was observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 m@@ g. and without loss of death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis has a high plasma processor in the treatment of a trans@@ do@@ vi@@ zation . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors are medi@@ ated on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine @-@ alpha receptor .
&quot; during the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ z@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the cleaning . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled study in week 52 , the proportion of the patients suffering from the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvements than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which amounted to 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , with the primary degree of weight gain ( N = 18 or 13 % of the valuable patient rate ) , there was significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l to placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a substantial effect on placebo was comparable to placebo with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol per week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also pointed out 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy found a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ian patients who had reached a re@@ mission before Rand@@ om@@ isation in comparison to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline in the mania . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for Deh@@ y@@ dri@@ fication and Hydro@@ xy@@ de for Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l with extensive met@@ alli@@ zation of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ition@@ ers via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , likewise at an pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic examination sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients do not have sex dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed a reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the effects of the noise on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ genetic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with various gra@@ dient liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw s@@ no@@ bles at their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional clinical trials , tox@@ icity at repeated administration , tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and for can@@ o@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular dangers for people . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;

&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precipitation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold at the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ z@@ Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l , not more than 6 % of the concentrations in the study were detected in G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold in the central Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose . &quot;

&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , with the primary degree of weight gain ( N = 18 or 13 % of the valuable patient rate ) , there was significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fi@@ xer or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if a oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by ob@@ tru@@ sive regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given at least depending on the individual clinical status ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems which caused differently than sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in addition , a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ az@@ ep@@ inen is also considered necessary to be considered necessary , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations for the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions are not available for patients with alcohol or medicines ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied to treat patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial or isch@@ em@@ ic heart failure , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conv@@ ection disorders , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ th@@ p@@ it , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regard to a deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effect , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers ( 15 mg dose ) was applied as one single occupancy in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and which received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ um . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ dar@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not considered so@@ unding . &quot;
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ izing the common application of high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 has resulted in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should be similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose above the companion of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ um , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant @-@ side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :

&quot; 107 The effects of the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified into clinical trials involving oral Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) , see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed with patients under Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ z@@ ol@@ - and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term period of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al problems was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ ting solution associated with statistically significantly greater improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / sexual dysfunction associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ ility and behavi@@ oral problems associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
&quot; the observed middle improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS @-@ Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced patient number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement in mental symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled study in week 52 , the proportion of the patients suffering from the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study records , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ Depres@@ sions @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which amounted to 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia , the 3@@ 14 patients included in the primary degree of weight gain ( N = 18 or 13 % of the valuable patient rate ) in significantly less patients compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study on 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not give an excessive effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study on man@@ ian patients who had reached a re@@ mission before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ for@@ zo@@ l showed to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline in the mania . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulation .
&quot; in 2 trials with healthy volunteers , medium time to reach the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and apes and resulted in any direct tox@@ icity of a target range according to a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproduction hardened according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns according to maternal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure was 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) to security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity , repeat@@ ed@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and for can@@ o@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular dangers for people . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a primary study , where the 460 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who had conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy of disease and survival compared to the disease . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , expressed in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing drugs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it must not be applied to patients who have low neutr@@ ality numbers in the blood prior to the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist agent ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients , where the first treatment was no longer so@@ lic@@ ated , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication should not be given to other drugs to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Official Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited approval for the office of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and for which is not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neutral amounts &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; when sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 is to break down , until an improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
&quot; there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) . &quot;
no studies involving patients with affecting kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dos@@ ing adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to cause harmful and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked Nan@@ op@@ arti@@ f@@ ulating from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could be essentially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and treated a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in the patient , no re@@ fresh treatment cycles should be conducted , until the neut@@ rop@@ orti@@ zation has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with heavy liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven in the context of cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed patient collection are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients suffering from Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarr@@ hea , these are treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ als and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women in the aged age who do not practice an effective conception , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women in age @-@ capable age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be attached , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child . &quot;
male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sperm mot@@ oring since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as fatigue ( very common ) and dizziness ( frequently ) that can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; in the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ otrop@@ ia ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side @-@ side effects are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; commonly ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ose hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; Dy@@ ch@@ ag@@ ie , bl@@ ur@@ ging , burning dry , dry mouth , mer@@ cen@@ ary g@@ ums , pain@@ t@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , pain in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal diseases of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , genital pain , pain pain@@ s , pain pain@@ s , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , un@@ eas@@ iness in the structure , muscle weak@@ nesses very often : &quot;
o@@ hel@@ o@@ idal 1 The incidence of sensiti@@ vely reactions is calculated based on a definite fall in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no contra@@ ctual relationship with these events were established . &quot;
&quot; pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ active antibody that promotes mer@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tu@@ bing indi@@ mer@@ cies and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing of their Dep@@ oly@@ mers . &quot;
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a standar@@ dis@@ ation of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is medi@@ ated by plasma components in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ ax@@ el promotes transport from pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor is medi@@ ated and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ating protein SP@@ ARC ( Pol@@ ted egg aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of tum@@ ors .
&quot; the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is treated with data from 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study . &quot;
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
this multic@@ enter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation to prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 minutes in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; when taking into the study , 64 % of patients had an impact state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % for metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who have received the first @-@ line therapy , are below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who lived at a time during the therapy a peri@@ ph@@ ere Neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 , evaluated . &quot;
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for c@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute In@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials . &quot;
the liquid exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous gift from Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer , the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration in multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or pasture with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced tum@@ ours patients the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ genetic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 intraven@@ ously with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
&quot; Clear@@ ance from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a solv@@ ent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ lized on the first line to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the average total dose of less than 1 % of the total dose , with less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ xy@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than 75 years , only few data are available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ genetic analysis . &quot;
&quot; the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , and light @-@ protected light over 8 hours . &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and as well as in other potentially toxic substances should be careful when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ring@@ es , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chloride @-@ in@@ fusion solution is in@@ jected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ In@@ side bottle . &quot;

&quot; member states must ensure that the owner of approval for placing on the market will be provided by the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets with the following information and materials : &quot;
• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug content ( technical information ) ; labelling and packing instructions . • With unique image of the product acci@@ dentally cold boxes for transporting through patients .
this means that abor@@ tion is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; in case of patients with normal blood samples , it may occur in relation to blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with abor@@ tion must be led under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is shown . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
injection can also be made by the patient or his counsel@@ ors if they have received an appropriate guide .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients are to be control of treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency should be administered , and ice @-@ energetic should be administered during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or by that the body does not suff@@ ice to the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ ine . &quot;
ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and the consequences of a loss of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it be@@ ates to the formation of ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a primary study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia compared to reference drug .
all patients had been in@@ jected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been in@@ jected at least eight weeks before they received either re @-@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also put the results of a study before , where the effects of the skin spec@@ kled Ab@@ se@@ amed was investigated by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were applied to the same degree as for those patients who continue to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continue to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl to the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase of blood pressure , occasionally to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
abor@@ tion may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
&quot; se@@ duc@@ ed as injection among the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist Drug Administration ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine was provided according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence , that the medicine was a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which produces Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug . &quot;

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) unless the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie .
&quot; symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total illness . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided for a period of four weeks .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;

if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored and monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms . &quot;
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher output outlets than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .

&quot; patients should be monitored and monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ g@@ inal number has risen by at least 40,000 cells / kg compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 kg / kg should be maintained three times per week or 450 kg / kg per week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the reag@@ ent number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 kg / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.e. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value at ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ g@@ inal count increased to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl each week , the dose of 300 kg / kg should be maintained three times per week . &quot;

&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a f@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ on@@ ical cooking solution to ensure the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in at a ery@@ thro@@ blast open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) , should not be given an abor@@ tion or any other ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine ( see section 4.4 - Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stro@@ kes within one month prior to the treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep ven@@ enth@@ esis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ stly known ven@@ ous thro@@ bo@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , the application of ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is contra@@ cted in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ al arter@@ ial disease , vas@@ cular disease of the Kar@@ oti@@ des or zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ inary disease ; in patients with recently built @-@ in heart attack or cereb@@ ro@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular event . &quot;

&quot; in patients with sudden loss of loss , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ speaking ( iron , folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ at@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ is value , taking into consideration the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &quot; Index &quot; ) , which is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / Mik@@ rol@@ lers or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be weighed to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in patients with a risk for anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 of the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; in clinical trials , an elevated mortality risk and risk of severe cardi@@ ac cancer have been observed if ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese @-@ stimul@@ ating active ingredients ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit , which is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins , when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased on the control of an@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of increased blood pressure .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ sely cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ising or storage @-@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 of the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; according to present findings by treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Epo@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine response should be taken into account ( patients that may be trans@@ f@@ aded ) . &quot;
if the H@@ b increase is lower than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) to minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic an@@ emia - Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the respective patients , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia are examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should have an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular disorders , especially in an initial cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting rate of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ ins did not prove to improve survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia which significantly reduce the risk of the tumor . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received chemotherapy , received a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8,7 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa will be applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ is should be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro @-@ vitro tests on tumor guns , no indications can be seen on an interaction between ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F for hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;

the most common side effect during treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ ovas@@ cul@@ ous events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treatment , in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood don@@ ors to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular complications may come . &quot;

&quot; survival and tumor legs were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients , four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and &quot;
in the open study there was no difference in survival compared to re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients with a an@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ ant consistent , statistically significantly higher mortality than with the controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are treated on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in for tumour patients treated with the aim to transfer a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value under 13 g / dl , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ value of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that can be reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they are appointed 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;

&quot; • In a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or stroke , if you suffer un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first stepped or increased breast pain ) , the risk of blood pressure in the v@@ eins ( deep Ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis ) is - if you have occurred before such a le@@ th@@ rop@@ ause for example . &quot;
&quot; you are suffering from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ial arter@@ ial disease ( vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ oti@@ ves ) or of the brain ( cereb@@ ral disease ) or brain ( cereb@@ ral disease ) , and recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with abor@@ tion , it can come back to a slight dos@@ is@@ cope with a slight dos@@ ing number of persons , which will return to another treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , their doctor will conduct regular blood tests in order to regularly check the number of bleeding during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fol@@ acid re@@ ins , should be taken into consideration and treated at the beginning of the therapy with aby@@ ss . &quot;
very seldom was reported on the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ body ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( among the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ y open@@ ie , he will break your therapy with abor@@ tion and define how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated at best . &quot;
&quot; therefore , abor@@ tion must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; when increased or offensive potassium , your doctor may consider a interru@@ ption of treatment with dis@@ se@@ amed , until the cali@@ bre values lie back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to present knowledge , the treatment of blood flow with abor@@ tion in adults with chronic kidney problems ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) that are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the efficacy of abor@@ tions .
&quot; 200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust their ab@@ duc@@ ed dose accordingly to the risk of le@@ ather@@ proof ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ted compared to the treatment with ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa derived advantages , especially if you have an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events such as you are ob@@ ese ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or lung em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , you think Ab@@ se@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a major orthop@@ ae@@ dic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed was examined and treated accordingly to the cause of an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of bleeding after the operation . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you are taking other medicines / apply or previously applied / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with abor@@ tion if your doctor may apply certain blood tests in order to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ in .
&quot; laboratory studies have no interaction between ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F , or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer - chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood flow ( an@@ emia ) speaks to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests in order to check treatment results and ensure that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value .
&quot; as soon as you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ d@@ ations between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests in order to check treatment results and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .

&quot; to ensure and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treat@@ able doctor will conduct regular blood testing . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to cut the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 kg / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before the surgery , the day of the intervention and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a sickness , which makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause as well as in men . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including those who suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip break like in patients ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hat@@ ch@@ itis should get a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain , and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ ometric was attracted to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently had suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; it was investigated the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies with 3@@ 57 patients and six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was , whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme which is to be norm@@ alized in blood ) in the blood , or at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ ra@@ tions in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced by 70 % compared to patients compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients receiving placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
&quot; most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur in the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequently in case of repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( extinction of bone tissue ) in pine . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a introduces recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • In men with an increased risk for fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a newly @-@ trau@@ matic low @-@ trau@@ matic hip . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long R@@ emis@@ si@@ vity was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , accordingly to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , a initial dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the prevalence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney problems ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patient groups .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data on inno@@ c@@ ality and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because of these patient population are only limited clinical experiences . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a pre@@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia is treated by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the quick integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , with symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ cal@@ an@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , accordingly to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , bad oral hygiene , should be weighed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates a tooth@@ ed treatment with reasonable preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require d@@ ain@@ ees , there are no data available if the interru@@ ption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ate reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the pine area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by investig@@ ating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of one patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the prevalence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may occur by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of serious adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon Rec@@ ur@@ tic Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall incidence of invent@@ ories between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , undes@@ irable medicines are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney function disorder C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic has been associated with kidney problems ( i.e. an increase in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the variation of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis of three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory tests , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values found below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures following a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the pine area Gel@@ eg@@ ingly became , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the pine area ) reported using bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients according to Zah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other D@@ ental@@ ein@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients with oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in a pine area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and treated patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hy@@ po@@ cal@@ an@@ emia can be reached by gift of oral calcium , and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once annually has been shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ um ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ ist .
effects on morph@@ ometric disorders ( A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral fra@@ c@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a pointed out the same lasting effects over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk for hip fra@@ c@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total th@@ ig@@ h around 6.0 % , rose by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology at 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , were taken from the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic sponge . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in common bone volumes associated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in comparison to placebo and received the preser@@ vation bone architecture .
&quot; bone detection mark@@ er The bone @-@ specific epi@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial output after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirrors have not been measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D in total th@@ ig@@ h and scar@@ ves at all time points .
&quot; the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment performed 24 months compared to placebo treatment , increasing the BM@@ D increased by 5.4 % in total assets and 4.3 % at stake . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
&quot; in a different study involving men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in comparison to the percentage of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at relative to the percentage of the Len@@ den@@ verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D was not stated after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ wing A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase accordingly to 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific standard value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 . the effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparison studies .
&quot; in combination with the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain kill@@ ers were observed in comparison to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months . &quot;
&quot; patients , which were classified according to the end of the six months of primary study ( on the therapy ) , were included in a follow @-@ up phase . &quot;
&quot; of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was observed in 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of the mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 @-@ 15 minutes per@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be classified as dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the plasma level increased rapidly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
it ru@@ st@@ ling bi@@ phase disappearance from the big cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ -@@ 0.@@ 24 and t ½ h 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ ally Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period t ½ g 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned t ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone fabric . &quot;
&quot; the total body cle@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished cle@@ ance of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes in metabolic substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ lized - because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , full @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and at the 64 investigated patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid . &quot;
&quot; as for heavy kidney problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , there are no declar@@ ations for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ tu@@ ally effective intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were given the 6@@ fold ( based on the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ dering a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application has been identified as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that equals 7@@ fold of the human therap@@ ist exposure to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects of other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ated primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ se of long bones in the growth phase with almost all doses , a fund that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
in rats a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at doses reduced from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton .
rab@@ id effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits although the maternal tox@@ icity were distinctive with 0.1 mg / kg due to the lowest serum calcium mirror .

&quot; according to CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a over@@ working R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known to affect the present statements on safety , pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ize the risk of risk ( for pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ an@@ il@@ ance or risk management ) . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ st@@ anz@@ ee that is called bis@@ phosph@@ orus , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of gender hormone levels , especially est@@ rogen which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is un@@ arranged , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or you have to under@@ go dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or the care staff when using other drugs / apply or previously applied / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are using medicines , of which it is known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s use of food and drinks , you worry , that in accordance with the instructions of your physician , you have enough liquid before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; once you have broken the hips , it is recommended to increase the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may need a further dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions , so the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; when administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed , you will promptly inform yourself with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date . &quot;
&quot; before the termination of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , you will consider the termination of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a please take your next physician &apos;s min and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; adverse events in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common in the following in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and shi@@ vers , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to increase two or more weeks after the surgical supply of the hat@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be adequ@@ ately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients suffering from diabe@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the quick integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid to bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic abandoned , hypo@@ cris@@ z@@ a@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , accordingly to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or higher the overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
&quot; in addition , four studies conducted at over 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used in comparison to placebo as a supp@@ orter of the noise . &quot;
&quot; to study the noise , however , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to estimate in this application area . &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? he &apos;s the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper breathing . ng The complete list of effects associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects are to be taken .
&quot; it may also be applied to patients who suffer from an existing serious depression or treated with anti@@ depress@@ ants , as the risk of depression , and among others , may cause a small minority of patients &quot; Su@@ izi@@ dge@@ . &quot; &quot;
caution is offered when using A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA with medicines like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means for use at H@@ IV@@ - infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or Cl@@ arith@@ me@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on the effectiveness and confidenti@@ ality .
&quot; La Depres@@ sive Diseases or Me@@ al changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , Su@@ izi@@ dge@@ - received up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; GE and depress@@ ant disorders may not be applied to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , unless the benefit of the treatment in individual case weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients suffering from obesity - in addition to obesity - no recogni@@ zable risks , depres@@ sive reactions may occur . &quot;

&quot; SS@@ E received important patients as well as patients with obesity , and in addition to 3800 patients in other indications . &quot;
&quot; to the following table ( Table 1 ) , the effects of adverse adverse effects in placebo @-@ controlled trials have been treated with patients who have been treated for weight reduction and esc@@ orted metabolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; if the incidence was statistically significant higher than the respon@@ ding of placebo ( for un@@ wanted effects , ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ ability study , which were given to a limited number of persons , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or Dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia .

in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) was the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value ( with an output value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo
&quot; the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % , was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; the difference between the average weight change between the 20 m@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value for patients suffering from Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to the effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % due to the weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; for 2 hours , the Ste@@ ady state plasma plasma level were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ itation gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; influence of food : he subjects , the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant received either in wet@@ lands or after a fat meal , increased by 67 % increased C@@ max or by 48 % increased ng AU@@ C . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ating har@@ mac@@ ular analysis ( age @-@ spectrum 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year @-@ old patient grew by 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data concerning the safety of un@@ wanted adverse events , which were not observed in clinical trials , were identified as relevant for clinical use in human therapeutic field , but may be relevant to clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of the vul@@ sions with process @-@ related stress seems to be associated with animals as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant has given Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant over a longer period before the m@@ ating ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no undes@@ ired effects were observed on ferti@@ liz@@ ing or cycl@@ amen . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat bur@@ ring in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public , The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be explained in which the Committee for Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) presented the studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in patients ( such as diabe@@ tic medicine ) . • It can be applied together with another diet medicine ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ material or insulin , the old dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ material or insulin can be retained in patients with hy@@ po@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better , and the blood sugar level is decreasing , which is better to set type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ as , and in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ elled hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered with doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional gift of acet@@ ate in an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ material in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo was reduced by 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study conducted in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin were examined in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were bl@@ ur@@ red disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used either in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , even in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high ket@@ ones - acid mirror - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to acquire Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin treatment with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar with insulin is in@@ adequate , and in those met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ vity is in@@ appropriate ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of continuously . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or o@@ e@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and the existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports about cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror increases up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the liver enzy@@ matic values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient &apos;s symptoms are developed that indicate un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , th@@ igh@@ te@@ ousness , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ matic values . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the occurr@@ ence of the laboratory parameters were led by clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir from fat @-@ deposits and connected in some cases with fluid re@@ jection . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a Hem@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction in mid @-@ grade hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and a lower extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ material and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity , patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , or two @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material or two @-@ combination therapy with insulin therapy , is the risk of a dos@@ ing dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported in the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , on an appearance or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but ad@@ mitt@@ ing doctors should report to the possibility of mac@@ ular failure to be considered . a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of announ@@ cing un@@ wanted events regarding bone fr@@ eres , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with compar@@ ative media .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with compar@@ ative media . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is ab@@ using ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies in investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interaction with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induction ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attributable to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one who dimin@@ ished hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance to breast cancer and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ eit@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the lens and refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ glyc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ ge compet@@ ed over three times the upper limit of the standard range in addition to placebo , but less rare as compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ material . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study with advanced advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ an . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch was rarely reported on heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in history . &quot;
&quot; it was a summar@@ izing analysis of un@@ wanted events regarding bone fr@@ eres , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in comparison with compar@@ ative media . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of the PRO@@ active study , Fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative media . &quot;
&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to operate on a activ@@ ating specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ation ) Rec@@ ep@@ or @-@ linol@@ enic ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to the animal model to an elevated ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripher@@ al glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de versus Mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time until subsequent to the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients , their blood sugar , despite three @-@ month optimization phase , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to only received insulin ; a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves in comparison to the output values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was evaluated in a small , aged 18 weeks to type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , and a minor , but clin@@ ically significant increased L@@ DL - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic and free fatty acids , and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , no statistically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level was detected , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks of reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , not only the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved tri@@ glyceri@@ des increased tri@@ glyceri@@ de level , as well as a effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption as well as on the em@@ ian tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with leading concentration to un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma normally lasts 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV reduces its effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or ) or ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induction ) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was found mainly in barrels ( 55 % ) and found a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the medium plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 @-@ 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral cle@@ ance of the parent &apos;s dam are similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and apes agreed with repeated plasma volume enlargement , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trop@@ hy . &quot;
this is attributable to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which reduces hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance to breast cancer and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ eit@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) Hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) were induc@@ ted in the ur@@ inary bladder cancer .
in a veter@@ inary model of the familiar poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in a increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ ums .
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with compar@@ ative media .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with compar@@ ative media . &quot;
&quot; in a further study about two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves in comparison to the output values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks of reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , not only the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but improved in addition , the post@@ oper@@ atively increased tri@@ glyceri@@ de level , with a effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic absorption as well as on the em@@ ian tr@@ y@@ g@@ ari@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the goal of their primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , stroke , ak@@ ut@@ onic cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation , leg amp@@ utation above the kn@@ u@@ kul@@ ari@@ zation , leg amp@@ utation above the Kn@@ u@@ kul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , put the results close to taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular risk . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of announ@@ cing un@@ wanted events regarding bone fr@@ eres , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials treated over a period of up to 3.5 years , with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed an increased incidence of bone breasts in women . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with compar@@ ative media . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicates that blood sugar levels have been lowered considerably like with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or another of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane could possibly be adapted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood sugar ( the full list is to take the package b@@ eil@@ ing ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ist Drug Administration ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should prevail over the risks of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the office of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
&quot; for at least 6 seconds , injection no@@ bility must be loaded under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was in@@ jected . &quot;
&quot; for example , patients whose blood glucose is significantly improved by a intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; each change in strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin etc ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ kind or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA vs. insulin @-@ animal origin ) can result in a change of dosage is needed . &quot;
&quot; if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adjustment is necessary , this may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients with which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal insulin reactions , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or differently than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys can lead to other times or have to be used in other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy and en@@ quiries his patients always after others received from them . &quot;
&quot; 4 . probably hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , can occur in a non @-@ sufficient diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ normal@@ ities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can lead to consciousness and / or sei@@ zu@@ res with temporary or lasting distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .
&quot; illness of the nervous system Gel@@ eg@@ ger - Peri@@ ph@@ ere Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood glucose monitoring can be associated with complaints which are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually reversible . &quot;
5 A Inten@@ si@@ zing of insulin therapy with a corrupt improvement of blood glucose . however , can be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the skin and the skin cell tissue Gel@@ eg@@ ger - Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy At the injection station can be created , if it has failed to switch to the injec@@ tions within the injection range . &quot;
&quot; General disorders and complaints at the administration of Gel@@ eg@@ ger - local over@@ sensitivity reaction during the insulin therapy during insulin therapy ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; disorders of the immune system Gel@@ eg@@ ger - Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms gener@@ alized over@@ sensitivity , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ics , pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop continuously : • S@@ te Hy@@ po@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugar foods . &quot;
diabe@@ tics should therefore always be treated with grape varieties , sweets , cookies , or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice in themselves . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia are treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose , which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total amount of life is up to 24 hours . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is in it that it is a blend of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of divisions ( hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sis ) places on human insulin molecules were drawn into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites in the split were active .
&quot; based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gifts , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , for cardiovascular potential and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data can be seen no special dangers for human beings . &quot;
it is recommended - after the acet@@ ate bottle is taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of insulin is taken at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is used according to the manual for the first use .
&quot; some patients with which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal insulin reactions , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or differently than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy and en@@ quiries his patients always after others received from them . &quot;
&quot; 12 So hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , can occur in a non @-@ sufficient diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ normal@@ ities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
13 An intention of insulin therapy with a corrupt improvement of blood glucose can however be connected with a temporary deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .

&quot; set the end cap of your Nov@@ o@@ let manufacturing process , if it &apos;s not in use to protect it from light . &quot;
&quot; take the closing event . • Add the rubber stem with a medical Tu@@ cker • Use the f@@ lap of a new injection pin to avoid a contamination of a Nov@@ o@@ Fine In@@ jection . • remove the f@@ lap of the injection pin and the inner cap of injection no@@ bility . &quot;
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure a correct dosage : • Keep Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection pin to top • Klo@@ p for a few times with the finger easily against the cartridge .
&quot; if air bub@@ bles are present , these will continue to keep up in the cartridge at the top , turn the cartridge for one click towards the arrow ( figure B ) • Now at the top of the injection , press a drop of insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; • Put the closing event so on the finished pen , that the number 0 is compared to the dos@@ ing mark ( figure D ) • check if the pressure kno@@ b is over . &quot;
&quot; if the pressure kno@@ b can &apos;t move freely , insulin is pressed in the injection pin • The scale on the end cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the press button moves outside , while you turn the end cap • The scale under the press button ( press stud sk@@ ala ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; 107 Please note the highest number you can see on the press button below , add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a false dose , turn off the circuit board simply forward or back@@ wards until you have set the right number to units . &quot;

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already identified signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ances , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or tox@@ icity ( &quot; stones &quot; ) which can lead to joint and bone damage . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg every day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , tox@@ icity may still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic will take further medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , since it was not investigated for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( other medicines for treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ure@@ aci@@ dic levels in the blood was compared with the last three measurements at 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily was 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who once daily intake a ure@@ th@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with cardiovascular problems may also involve an increased risk of certain adverse events that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood acid level in the blood , but also a higher risk of adverse events related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic Hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia , which have already led to ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ings ( including one of the story @-@ known or currently present Gi@@ cht@@ el and / or Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum acid layer is still considered after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney disease , the efficacy and safety has not been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ ate is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; for organ transplan@@ t , it is no experiences in organ transplan@@ t , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ ate is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended for treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ ate ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic drugs , it can occur during the treatment options to a acute tox@@ icity , because of lowering the serum acid level initially , can be mobil@@ ised in tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so far rise that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials were observed in the clinical studies of the liver values with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ ate treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function prior to the beginning of Feb@@ . ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was not performed any interaction studies at Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ s ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors are not in connection with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ ac@@ in / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without that a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at or the same other active ingredient is needed .
&quot; in a study with subjects performed 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C by Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which points to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous taking of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , ret@@ arded the recording of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( about 1 hour ) , but no significant changes in AU@@ C causes . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not release any side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be c@@ auti@@ ous in the control of a vehicle , serve machines or with exercising dangerous activities , until they can be reas@@ onably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot;
a number of higher incidence of investig@@ ators reported cardiovascular events in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ in@@ ol group ( 1.4 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term - extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) was observed and no significant correlation with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( investig@@ ator assessment ) occurred in connection with the medicine , and in all Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at@@ at treatment groups could be listed below , are listed below . &quot;
diarr@@ hea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials have been observed , severe skin strikes or serious bre@@ vity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated with up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported during the long @-@ term - extension studies reported similar events that were reported in the phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once , and in patients who received February 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with a exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment condition were either reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies in phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , anti @-@ inflammatory , rash , Bur@@ sit@@ is , Protein@@ ur@@ ie , genetic dysfunction , erectile dysfunction , burst concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
mode of action ur@@ ic acid is the end product of Pur@@ in@@ metabolic ism and arises in the scope of reaction cas@@ cade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ sel@@ ective @-@ sel@@ ective In@@ hibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a Ki @-@ value for the in vitro inhibit@@ ing , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was performed in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study of the proportion of patients with which the last three month spent a certain serum acid level &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ en@@ etic value at the trial of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed with regard to the lowering of the serum acid levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) the statistically significant over@@ due both of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
&quot; in regard to the long @-@ term lowering of the serum acid level , the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the common use of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg . &quot;
patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were treated for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ; # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg .
the lowering of the serum acid level at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed in the physician &apos;s visit during week 2 and maintain permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function of the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney disease ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clinical significant differences in relation to the process of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney problems ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; in two years , data collected from the open extension study of the Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the incidence of toxic waste ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) showed that less than 3 % of the patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed a treatment against a paraly@@ tic feed ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients had not required any treatment against plaster ) . &quot;
this was associated with a reduction in gre@@ ek size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of tox@@ ins up to month 24 . &quot;
increased t@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ at to administration is easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multi @-@ cou@@ pler cans of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clinical change was observed in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration of the serum concentration of the serum concentration ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is in range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the Plas@@ map@@ le integration of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) , and is constant over the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro @-@ studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ant metabol@@ ites are made primarily by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 mainly through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine took place in the urine ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ abol@@ ism ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ changeable Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ ide of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ abol@@ ism ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure changes the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at do not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 times by 7.5 m @-@ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 m @-@ g / ml , in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
&quot; 12 liver function , after intake multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with light ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification ) , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and its metabol@@ ites are not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
&quot; age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ . ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites , after taking multi @-@ cou@@ pler doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients , compared to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ ese , impair@@ ment of fer@@ til@@ ity in male rats was found a statistically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder infections ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and Kar@@ zin@@ ome ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly dosed group , with approximately 11 times the exposure of people . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and ur@@ inary composition and is not relevant for clinical use as a result .
it has been found that Feb@@ . ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , approximately at 4.@@ 3 times of the human@@ ist exposure , maternal tox@@ icity occurred , which entered with a reduction in order and a development delay in rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions that were about the 4.3 times and in tra@@ cting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times of human@@ therapeutic exposure , had no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness in which the bones are broken ) in women after men@@ opause in which a risk of low vitamin D mirrors .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; da Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who exclusively stand alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data to the fact that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain in motion ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ ence ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , so@@ unding abdom@@ en ( stomach problems ) , trimm@@ ed abdom@@ en ( kn@@ itting stomach ) as well as su@@ res p@@ ushing . &quot;
&quot; in patients with wa@@ al sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be used to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand at least 30 minutes long or sit in . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a approval for the office of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplement ) for the day . &quot;
&quot; the following references are accurate to follow the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) : &quot;
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not che@@ wing or cr@@ ust the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patient should not be done before taking the tablet , at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. p@@ izz@@ ical ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ l@@ astic , only under special attention ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; s@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients under the in@@ gest@@ ion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one ( some were these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore refer to all signs and symptoms to point out the symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ity reactions , and the patients are to be pointed out with symptoms of symp@@ tom or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or new or conce@@ aling the medicines ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious mal@@ icious side effects seems to be increased in patients who don &apos;t take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point on an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions will be passed to patients and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market introduction ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a were reported , including some severe and complications ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of j@@ aw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ ist gave mainly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available to indicate whether the setting of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who require a j@@ aw surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw .
the clinical assessment by investig@@ ating doctor is crucial for the treatment of treatment in every patient based on a specific benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the patient must be instructed , that they should take the tablet to a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE by taking the tablet in the next morning , after they have noticed their so@@ unding . &quot;
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day of the week@@ day . &quot;
other illnesses that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines that occurred clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore not apply during pregnancy even of l@@ act@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one do not allow information to be seen directly to the pregnancy that embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ ate ; most reports origin@@ ate from cancer patients but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; nevertheless , the serum calcium carbonate of up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) were included in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ sequence of oral overdose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ thal@@ mia , and side effects in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach mood , so@@ burn , o@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gast@@ ric or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid was significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / l &#91; 23 ng / l &#91; 23 ng / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mol / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one alone ( 12 % vs . ) . &quot;
studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at The therapeutic equality of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once per week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was detected in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at on bone mass and fra@@ cture response in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur inter@@ vention@@ ist study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the mean increase in the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.8 % at the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ as and 7.8 % at the tro@@ users . &quot;
&quot; compared to the placebo group , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to the placebo group was 3.2 % compared to the placebo group ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the increase of the BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued , also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ es and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit out of two pl@@ az@@ ed @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ one daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily ) has been taken either via 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurr@@ ence of at least one new cycl@@ ist by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption is related to an intraven@@ ous reference dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one at women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
&quot; the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % , when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis was effective in oste@@ opor@@ osis , when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) led to no clinical significant changes in oral bio@@ availability ( 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is distributed according to an intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly distributed in the bones or out with urine . &quot;
&quot; after an intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one , about 50 % of the radioactive substance were eliminated within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects . &quot;
&quot; according to an intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , ren@@ al cle@@ ance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic cle@@ ance exceeded no 200 ml / min . &quot;
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or bas@@ al transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not accepted that people affected the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by this transport systems .

&quot; the ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ actively mark@@ edly vitamin D3 with healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2,4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4,9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with clinical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , which is not shi@@ fted in the bones , will quickly pass over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is present , however , it is expected to calculate that ren@@ al elim@@ ination of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , an increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at can be expected in the bones ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered as an adult patients who was transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent degra@@ dation of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft can already be used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ anza was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ in . &quot;
the main inde@@ k@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ tation was rejected by a year ( by asking for example a new organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis required ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ raf is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body . &quot;
&quot; headache , headache , nausea / vomiting , diarr@@ hea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nie ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with serious over@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , Mac@@ eyel@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ anza , as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation regim@@ ens , this medication should be arranged or make changes in immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft ab@@ uses or to an increased incidence of adverse events , including under@@ - or immun@@ immun@@ os@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging inspection of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; following a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us will remain . &quot;
the dos@@ ing of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of abr@@ asion and toler@@ ability in individual case and blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommend@@ ations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks to conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , the systemic exposure measured as a mirror @-@ mirror , with both formulation , both in kidney and transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation in Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in direct transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first post @-@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentration to the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application for the supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft reactions must be maintained , the immun@@ os@@ ression of immun@@ ity must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustments can be needed later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft failure The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have a gra@@ ft receiver twice daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ anza , this change@@ over in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose , to be made . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over of other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once a day must start the treatment with the transplan@@ tation and liver transplan@@ t recommended dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis .
&quot; for adult patients suffering from Ad@@ vag@@ anza , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day should be taken once daily . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recei@@ vers Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ cre@@ as and present @-@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in oral transplan@@ t dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood cells in an@@ targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction in the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function , since ren@@ al function does not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum concentration , of a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ raf In addition to conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in full blood . the dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of abr@@ asion and toler@@ ability of full blood @-@ blood @-@ t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us inspec@@ tions .
&quot; it is advised to perform frequent inspec@@ tions of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mud during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ valley @-@ mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ anza , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , modifications of immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low cle@@ ance , the adjustment of the dose may require several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the radiation levels in the blood will not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley @-@ level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for garn@@ ish and heart@@ ed patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe adverse events , including gra@@ ft ab@@ uses or other side effects , which may occur in a row of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging inspection of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft removal , proved to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va than therapies , are not yet clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
for proph@@ yla@@ xis the transplan@@ t of transplan@@ t for adult heart transplan@@ t and gra@@ ft reactions in childhood are not yet clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation ad@@ vag@@ raf .
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction of t@@ acro@@ economic levels in the blood and a de@@ gl@@ ancing of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant fever ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) can be avoided , or other plant enh@@ ancer during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood are offered since the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , the chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hy could be observed , which therefore can be found under ad@@ vag@@ anza . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid exposure and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us symptoms may show symptoms for pre@@ aches such as headache , change of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision problems , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ anza Hart@@ kap@@ ass , ret@@ ard@@ ert , l@@ act@@ ose is contained in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or plant medic@@ inal agents , known as Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can alter the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and to set the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal digest@@ ion , resulted . &quot;

&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive , and thus increase the hormone exposure by making decisions about recep@@ tive actions . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can reduce potential cle@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a minor number of investigations into transplan@@ tation positions provide no indication that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ va is an increased risk of un@@ wanted events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended to any possible adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( particularly regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;

&quot; below are the effects following their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma map@@ a can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; mode of action and a dynamic effects on a molecular level is likely to be convey@@ ed by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us effects through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection of the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal handling due to the T cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was published in these published studies in the great studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t were used for primary immun@@ os@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation in an interim report about a recently performed , multic@@ enter study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported in more than 110 patients who received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; in the first year after transplan@@ tation , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was less frequently observed ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ economic - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ is converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly bigger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients suffering from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated syn@@ dro@@ ms with the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients . &quot;
&quot; a multi@@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted at 205 patients at the same time , subjected to a randomised trial and kidney transplan@@ t , which received following a randomised procedure T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was thereafter to reach the out@@ stretched valley mirror of 8 to 15 ng / ml of 5 .
&quot; intestinal transplan@@ t published in clinical study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as a primary immune response to intestinal transplan@@ t@@ ations in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ations ) under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , lead to an increase in the in@@ bound faction of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids that should be responsible for transplan@@ tation , higher cle@@ ance rates . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ lized in front of the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done by the g@@ all . &quot;
&quot; for stable patients who were employed by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was under ad@@ vag@@ anza almost 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ances is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII ) , con@@ genital blood pressure disorder ) . &quot;
dosage and frequency of application addressed then if Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical interventions .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ashes like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was taken into the formation of the human od@@ ine factor VIII .
&quot; adv@@ ances is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is similar to it , so it does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 % was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; in 86 % . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of Anti@@ bodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ise may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against human barley factor VIII , maus@@ oleum , or ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the B@@ ax@@ ter AG company to endor@@ se Adv@@ ance of Adv@@ ance in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy , after the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following h@@ äm@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not fall below the stated plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. , i.e. , i.e. , ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is passed by the patient .
&quot; during the treatment , it becomes appropriate to control the appropriate dose and incidence of injec@@ tions an adequate provision of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , which are different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different semi @-@ este@@ em times . &quot;
&quot; 3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be between 20 and 40 , i.e. factor VIII per kilogram of body@@ weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VIII risk activities are not reached or when the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to im@@ itate a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be weighed . &quot;
&quot; according to the patient , the administration speed should not be exceeded , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , ignor@@ ant Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ positions on the largest and genetic and other factors are dependent . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ ne@@ stic inhibit@@ or development , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recovery of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s observed in the number of patients observed in the number of patients ( 5 patients ) who were all treated with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; commonly known ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculated using the unexpected drop of blood cl@@ an factor VIII @-@ Spiegel@@ s post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ung was maintained during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and cle@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15 @-@ postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy @-@ to @-@ level hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure against factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; moreover , at least 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe until moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) decreased by a factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients suffering from inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of the patients on traces of contam@@ inated protein was analyzed by the investigation of the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms based on an allergic reaction or a hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ tes were reported in several repeated products positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first approval data , CH@@ MP has continued to be a positive rating , but in consideration that safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;

&quot; December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited distributed the Committee on Human@@ ist agent ( CH@@ MP ) officially concluded that the company returns his application for permission from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissues that combines other structures in the body , are surrounded and bases ) . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it is a type of virus that was genetically modified , that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has changed so much that there is no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections of man can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could be in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced by the non @-@ defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , normally carries the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can grow further and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the sub@@ strate , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers to the company , some questions were still un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the exam of the initially submitted documentation , CH@@ MP posted a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors are advantages for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment still for people who come in touch with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company continued to know the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; altered action release , means that the tablets are so re@@ structured that one of the most effective components instantly and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) used by a allergy against p@@ ollen ( c@@ logged nose ) in patients with nas@@ al sli@@ d ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice a tablet twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main performance measurements were the changes in the gravity of the gr@@ ass@@ ay symptoms that were reported by patients from the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study patients their symptoms carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal , and evaluated the symptoms in the last 12 hours , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; at observation of all gr@@ ass@@ ay symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze revenue , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients suffering from p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction in symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ers ( heart failure ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , dizziness , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ esque hyper@@ activity ( anti @-@ sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , redness , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different medicines for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients with hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stro@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to approval for the office of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without breaking them to break or che@@ w ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after removal of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days , as long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin with time . &quot;
&quot; after the decline of swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be continued than mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the medicine also contains contra@@ indications in patients treated with a mono@@ xide oxide ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after the termination of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , per@@ go@@ eyel@@ id , or@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ can@@ o@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ y@@ amin , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ yers , nap@@ haz@@ ards , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and the data are not sufficient to arrange appropriate recommendations to dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ ers were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function and the data are not sufficient to arrange appropriate recommendations to dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment with the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension , or pal@@ pit@@ ations of pal@@ pit@@ ations , arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; in treating the following patient groups , patients with cardiovascular disease • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in an@@ am@@ ol , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder cancer , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the history of history . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or in their extent .
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who were also administered , with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of Plas@@ ma@@ concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin have been observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be detected between Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme was not yet identified yet so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ ited in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; however , the in@@ consistency of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies occur , however , no increasing frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the incidence of normal population . &quot;
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and not to be applied to vas@@ in@@ aze in pregnancy in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied in fact that in very rare cases , it can be found in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ isions ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , stair@@ ways , etc . ) . &quot;

&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adju@@ v@@ ant P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measuring parameters including rein@@ forcement sub@@ jec@@ tively or tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 mg daily was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer , or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients aer@@ in@@ aze tablets were given . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ fest@@ ation tablets , determined by the total co@@ res for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al sli@@ m@@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ fest@@ ation tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al sli@@ m@@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin concerning the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; according to gender , age or ethnic origin , patient groups have no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in plasma is demonstr@@ able . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi@@ functional dos@@ is@@ study , which was conducted with the formulation of healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin badly damaged . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin after the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional clinical studies in safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gifts , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and reproduction of clinical trials can be seen no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no larger tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally consistent with the content of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
in reprodu@@ cible c@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was in the oral gift to rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 , and in Module 1 8.1 of the authorisation application , pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ ine system is established and functioning , before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ amine cover to relie@@ ve allergic symptoms by preventing , that hist@@ amine , a body @-@ own substance , can un@@ fold its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze pills relie@@ ve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as ni@@ b@@ room , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if you can occur or diagnosed with your application of aer@@ in@@ aze following symptoms or diseases : • hyper@@ tension • pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , headache , headache , or headache , or headache . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines , or recently taken care of prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; traffic noise and the use of machines for application in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that Aer@@ in@@ aze leads to Ben@@ ade@@ dness or down the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze when you should information immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you should have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the in@@ gest@@ ion of Aer@@ in@@ aze , if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the planned time . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you are significantly imp@@ aired , or notice side effects that are not specified in this manual report . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin very rarely about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , att@@ acking , it@@ ching and swelling ) or rash occurs . &quot;
&quot; more about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunt , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach problems , diarr@@ hea , dizziness , sei@@ zu@@ res , diarr@@ hea , sei@@ z@@ ure of physical liver , and about cases of remarkable liver values was also very rare . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to insert ( sol@@ uble tablets ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged from one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving approximately 4 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ ron , impair@@ ment of sleep and efficiency per day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were submitted to prove that the body utili@@ ze the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ tion and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 m@@ g. of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of symptoms with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % were compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to approval for the office of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials on the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur according to the existing disease , and can be terminated in accordance with the symptoms of the symptoms and re @-@ emerge again . &quot;
&quot; in persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the all @-@ energy time . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical phar@@ ma pharmac@@ ological study , aging A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not strengthened with effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the patients should however be clari@@ fied in fact that in very rare cases , it can be found in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect , these occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which were administered by up to 45 m@@ g. of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adju@@ v@@ ant P @-@ selection of end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was given a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical phar@@ ma pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes , including rein@@ forcement sub@@ jec@@ tively or tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ b@@ room , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ents and redness of eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided dependent on allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , as representative of other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , was similar to which the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is uncertain at the different forms and chronic patients can easily be recruited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine release of a urs@@ or factor in all ur@@ inary diseases is expected , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may also lead to improve the symptoms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rons at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to Anti@@ hist@@ amine , was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the rise of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no indications for clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , it was not yet identified for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin Respon@@ sible enzyme , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dos@@ ing of 7.5 mg ( fet@@ al @-@ cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and by Lor@@ at@@ adin .
&quot; based on conventional studies in safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gifts , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productions can be recogni@@ zable with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no special dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of the meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the advised medical doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data lie , which support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years are met@@ alli@@ zing Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and find out a higher limit load ( see under section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of as@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , restricted to metabolic , is identical to the same with children who is normal . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive or a suc@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not determined in the context of clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical phar@@ ma pharmac@@ ological study , at the simultaneous consumption of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not strengthened with effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ rup group as with the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at up to 45 m@@ g. of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment in question , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets in adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dos@@ ing of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed .
&quot; at a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets carried out clinical trials in adults and adolescents in clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it did not affect the simultaneous consumption of alcohol , neither to rein@@ forcement of alcohol induced efficiency . &quot;
&quot; adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in reducing symptoms such as ni@@ b@@ room , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ gs and redness of eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decreased by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
in two placebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rons at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the prevalence of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in an pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study involving sy@@ up@@ form@@ ulating in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis .
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 times higher and the C@@ max 3 times higher with a period of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no acceptance points for a clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .

overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group as well as the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than placebo was diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3,7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and insom@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study of 2.5 m@@ g. of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be dependent on allergic rhin@@ itis , as well as in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee on Human@@ ist agent ( CH@@ MP ) that the company returns to the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people . &quot;
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied for adults and older people to protect flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which may cause a strain of influenza , which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of flu virus appears , which can easily be spread out by man , because people still have no immune system ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will be able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a influenza virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface ) is separated from the human body as body @-@ strange , and is used as a part of the vaccine . &quot;
inspec@@ ting some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; for further information concerning the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules are available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pr@@ ase should then be designated if the doctor has checked , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient previously , and the probability that the virus is approved to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ pr@@ ase is targeted according to body weight . &quot;
ag@@ ase reduces in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also explo@@ it@@ ates the development of AIDS related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with low do@@ si@@ bly Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , A@@ pr@@ ase had been taken with 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
main inde@@ cent for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had taken after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase had also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults which had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ pr@@ one together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in patients who continue their existing prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ pr@@ ase should not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are just as cum@@ bias and in high concentrations in the blood of health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines of HIV , in patients suffering from cancer , the risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of infection ) or an immun@@ ity of immun@@ o@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ( symptoms of an infection that caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist Drug Administration ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase was in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy to treated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years , compared to risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee concluded that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase were taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for placing A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered at the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boo@@ sted with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration the individual viral resistance and pre@@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution is not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ grams basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ pr@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules can be applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ p@@ adding ) , higher doses of A@@ pr@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ agon@@ ists were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pr@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data regarding un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ genetic data , the dose of A@@ venti@@ onal capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pr@@ ase should not be given at the same time with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
vegetable preparations designed by Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with bladder does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C , treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; for the case of an an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre@@ existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ orti@@ id , which is not recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the potential benefit of a treatment reduces the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the epi@@ thel@@ ial function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the contamination of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended for simultaneous administration of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the international standardi@@ zation ratio ) are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to a reduced plasma level of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r less ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ y@@ symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high propaganda source of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ cted in children under an age of four years and should be applied to be careful with certain other patient groups . &quot;
ag@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , or an ex@@ az@@ an of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses where medication needed to be associated with the development of a type of diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infection can develop , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ factor diagnosis is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ pr@@ ase should not be given at the same time with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ pr@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines containing substances mainly via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe plasma levels of severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to an resistance development . &quot;
&quot; with an attempt to balance the lowest plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were observed very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The serum levels of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
&quot; if a patient receives Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ us@@ av@@ ir@@ cular mirror and if possible to check the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ rant we@@ eds . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ sp@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
&quot; for C@@ max , it is increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 m@@ g. of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the effectiveness and consistency of this therapy schem@@ as . &quot;
52 % hum@@ ili@@ ated when am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min &apos;s values of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) is approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily .
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , but it is not known to restri@@ ct a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ ese in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is strongly recommended due to the ant@@ it@@ azi@@ des component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase at least one hour apart . ( see ant@@ acids below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , at the gift of E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ yel@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data leave that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin can possibly stim@@ ate the serum concentration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is offered because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective due to the reduced or sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot;
&quot; when this medication is applied together , caution is offered : thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring will be made , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ c@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ c@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and thus reaching a rise in connected side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ding compound is required together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase were not performed in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin , but could be increased plasma @-@ binding of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of 700 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole twice daily , with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a daily basis , which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ vi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ pr@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids can not be taken at the same time as A@@ pr@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ uls@@ ants known as an enzyme @-@ duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r can lead to am@@ us@@ abo@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium @-@ recor@@ ders such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rim pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ vor@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ vor@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous taking with A@@ pr@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and increase side effects including P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ omy , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ at ( 4 times daily ) were increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ dens@@ ation interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ id , unless the possible benefit of treatment of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are overweight ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , high increases of plasma levels in simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma cutting increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended using am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us may be increased at the simultaneous gift of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase can not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ o inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ tor@@ rent .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ y@@ symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the very low reliability of historical compar@@ ability currently no recommendation can be given , such as the am@@ id@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is to be given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a reduction or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not pre@@ dict@@ able , hence altern@@ ate methods for contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
&quot; a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ line ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of ag@@ ro@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied only after careful sever@@ ity of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ able rats , am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r lives in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant women , which was administered from the in@@ wards into the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during feeding . &quot;
the further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive capacity was not affected by appointment of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
&quot; for adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials , clinical trials was studied in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were light up to moderate , occurred early and carried out rarely to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are stored in connection with taking of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not previously treated 1,200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were used by the investig@@ ating agents than in connection with the study medi@@ ation , were performed in more than 1 % of patients as well as listed under the treatment of acute lab changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of strong and fast @-@ fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ unding fat tissue ( Taurus ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in were treated with 113 anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in , a mean duration of 36 weeks ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients were treated with 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - previously treated patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is on a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; usually , skin strikes were usually light up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ches and occurred spontan@@ e@@ ously during the second treatment week , without leaving the treatment with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , in the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ ist infection can develop ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients were treated with PI in pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ pr@@ ase twice daily , with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were identified in patients with low do@@ si@@ bly Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ do@@ zation , the patient can be observed in signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting action . &quot;
&quot; am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r bin@@ s to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thus preventing the proc@@ ession of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ mers levels by the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; an an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ ph@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ at@@ avi@@ r ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ actively treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as well as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatments - the described mut@@ ations were seldom observed . &quot;
&quot; at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ s non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ vi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , an vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure can be examined by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with which an vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure within the 59 included , demonstrated resistance patterns that were similar to adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 3@@ R , M@@ 3@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ M , L@@ 90@@ M , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ons avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with four patients treated patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical publishers in patients with cervical mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance based analysis of Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used for evaluation of the activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 3@@ 2@@ V , and a dimin@@ ished li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of an vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to any additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
based on the phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance analy@@ tic analysis of clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the estimate of the activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
companies to distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ den@@ ces ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r associated samples produces a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross@@ resistance between am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ ulative patients who were a Fos@@ amp@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 is@@ ans ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early release of a sunk therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ e@@ and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ pr@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub@@ strate wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed A@@ pr@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , no low do@@ si@@ zed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI for the benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ max , it is lowered by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) , and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r from blood circulation in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma , whereby the amount of illeg@@ ally am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , which remains the active portion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active substances during the dosage of the dose concentrations in the Ste@@ ady state exceeds the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines containing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be induced or in@@ hib@@ ited or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given to caution if they are simultaneously given with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ ver@@ and@@ able as of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ base .
&quot; the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function should be low on the elim@@ ination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these therapy schem@@ atics are similar to those who are infected with healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r twice daily , without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the se@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , o@@ il@@ ul@@ omet@@ res in doses of doses taken on the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - triple ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to men , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for orig@@ ination of o@@ il@@ ular Aden@@ omes and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene tests , the bacter@@ al reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome @-@ ab@@ err@@ atic tests on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical trials , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase even after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity , which were treated from age 4 days , showed a high mortality rate as well as with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; with systemic plasma exposure which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose during humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor changes were observed that indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules can be applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ p@@ adding ) , higher doses of A@@ pr@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use in patients with low or lighter liver function should be done with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the international standardi@@ zation ratio ) are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
ag@@ ase should be set to duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to an resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ max , it is increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min &apos;s values of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) is approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily .
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , but it is not known to restri@@ ct a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ yel@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .
&quot; when this medication is applied together , caution is offered : thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring will be made , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ding compound is required together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is passed to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium @-@ recor@@ ders such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rim pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ vor@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ vor@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ vor@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ vor@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ at ( 4 times daily ) were increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ dens@@ ation interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a reduction or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied only after careful sever@@ ity of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant women , which was administered from the in@@ wards into the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during feeding . &quot;
&quot; for adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials , clinical trials was studied in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ do@@ zation , the patient can be observed in signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting action . &quot;
&quot; an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic in@@ infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
&quot; in the other way , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered by PI for the benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active substances during the dosage of the dose concentrations in the Ste@@ ady state exceeds the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines containing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be induced or in@@ hib@@ ited or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given to caution if they are simultaneously given with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function is likely to be low on the elim@@ ination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the se@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , o@@ il@@ ul@@ ary Aden@@ omes in doses of doses taken on the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of o@@ zel@@ ul@@ eres Aden@@ omes and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , few references for the acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene tests , the bacter@@ al reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome @-@ ab@@ err@@ atic tests on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity , which were treated from age 4 days , showed a high mortality rate as well as with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; these results can be concluded that in young the metabol@@ isation ways are not yet fully mature , so am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for entry is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of suffering from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ase solution &quot; &quot; was neither treated with PI in pre @-@ treated patients with PI . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution is not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ grams basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules , when taking the solution , taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ pr@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dose recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to insert and be low do@@ si@@ fted k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for use , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reactions as a result of the high propaganda disorder is A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting young children and children under 4 years , pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a qualified inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhyth@@ ms ( z ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with id@@ ol@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of a transfer of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the international standardi@@ zation ratio ) are available methods for determining active concentration . &quot;
ag@@ ase should be placed on duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to an resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ max , it is increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous taking with A@@ pr@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ments , vision problems and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expecting significantly higher plasma concentration . &quot;
the potential risk for man is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution may not be applied due to potentially toxic reactions from the fet@@ us to the contained propylene glyco@@ l non@@ l during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk l@@ able rats , am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r lives in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant women , which was administered from the in@@ wards into the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during feeding . &quot;
&quot; for adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials , clinical trials was studied in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are stored in connection with taking of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ actively treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as well as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatments - the described mut@@ ations were seldom observed . &quot;

the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete separation of patients . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated with six weeks or placebo either twice a day or five times a week .
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete release of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ os .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • For the treatment of War@@ ts in the genital area amounted to 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in placebo group . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ os , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic corne@@ al ker@@ at@@ os ( A@@ KS ) in the face , or on the scal@@ p with immune competent adults , if the size or the number of les@@ ions are contra@@ cted and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy is contra@@ cted or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; leave on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible lines of the genital or peri@@ an@@ al range disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; an interru@@ ption in the treatment procedure should be weighed , when intensive local inflammation appear ( see section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment area an infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions should only be cured ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is left out , the patient refused to apply the cream as soon as he noticed this and continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; in a thin layer , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is spread in a thin layer and to rub together with fet@@ ched @-@ infected skin range until the cream has completely moved completely . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should be carried out between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and associated with a possible fusion of auto@@ immune disease risk . &quot;
&quot; in case of these patients , it should be carried out between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and associated with a possible organ@@ ab@@ ili@@ ation or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies where no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is and a case with one of the circumcision are observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which caused a treatment required and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties with water caused by an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of affected area . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly in connection to treatment with other cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions for the treatment of external fet@@ uses in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al range , no clinical experiences are now available . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicates an increased rate of til@@ ting reductions at HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group , however . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair attachment was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take up in general during the therapy , or reactions from treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treat of several days can be made . &quot;
the clinical results of therapy can be judged after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months should be available for treatment with super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma other suitable therapy forms into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy for large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids in the inside of the nose or ears or on the lip@@ stick area within the Lip Aug@@ mentation .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os in anatom@@ ical positions outside the facial and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis in arms and hands support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore , such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions take normally in the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; when local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ credit@@ or les@@ ions have been referred to as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied to patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not go direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ og@@ al development , which are binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although either after one @-@ time top@@ ical application is quanti@@ fiable after several mal@@ oc@@ ative application ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given for use during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently used and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with three weeks of treatment were local reactions to the treatment of the patient &apos;s treatment ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; among the most frequently reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include symptoms at the application site with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
&quot; the patients treated from 185 to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III , reported adverse events . &quot;
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in this study were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . ) &quot;
&quot; the adverse events used by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis were listed below , listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to the audit plan , the evaluation of clinical signs indicates that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / bott@@ ling ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the audit plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times a lot of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy security formation ( 19 % ) came . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment place or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the essential oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized according to oral or intraven@@ ous liquid . &quot;
&quot; according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentration of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were proven . &quot;
&quot; in 3 appro@@ vals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the effectiveness in relation to a complete le@@ aning of the fet@@ uses at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was significantly superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a total of 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients was completely healed ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete release of 23 % of 157 treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ nat@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled study study after four years of present data show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % of all patients ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were so@@ unding and also stayed for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ ies in an inter@@ connected 25 c@@ m2 treatment area than the hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the annual data from two combined follow @-@ up studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing .
&quot; the approved indications of out@@ war@@ n , ac@@ ea ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fic@@ t@@ elles bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients in general , and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systematic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; serum concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated interim period was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; which points to a prolonged re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
&quot; the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month study , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; for a also four months , the study showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice in mice were induced in three days a week .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ed , is a risk of people because of systemic exposure than very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice , which has been treated with the real @-@ free cream , used earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness measured by reducing its effectiveness in the urine concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me concentrations in the urine decreased by about 60 % , and half of the treated children proved an abnormal large liver on the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , arth@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; common adverse events in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be badly sensitive to patients who react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , or another of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will require all new information that may be known to examine and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observe reactions to in@@ fusion and development of Anti@@ bodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for approval from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ kind α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ y ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ od@@ or , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient survi@@ ves every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure is not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended . &quot;
&quot; with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions , which are defined as each related by side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be monitored and in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase generally , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with the application of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as little experience regarding the treatment of treatment after a longer interru@@ ption , the treatment has to be c@@ auti@@ ous after the theoretical risk response after a interru@@ ption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or Anti@@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; in case of light or moderate @-@ free in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are taken to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
in@@ fusion with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred to be resumed .

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interfer@@ on with intra@@ cellular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments do not allow to direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data about new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended , while treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is not too breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events in clinical trials were observed mainly as in@@ fusion reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
undes@@ irable medicines in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tra@@ cts and lungs in front of the pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory failure and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wanted medication associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly heavy duty form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients within 3 months after the start of the treatment to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , with a heavy version of patients at the age of 5 ( on the average of 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or until an early ex@@ change@@ ation from the study ) were present in 13 / 45 patients no such antibody , including 3 patients who never had been to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with lack of low @-@ body levels resulted in a robust reduction of G@@ ag Spiegel@@ s in Har@@ n while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ale until low @-@ neutr@@ alizing effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of Anti@@ bodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired medicines as well as the occurr@@ ence of undes@@ ired pharmac@@ euticals typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and the preventing another accumulation of enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and from cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely to have man@@ ure @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of the patients were recruited by the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient rejected the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recruited if they had a for@@ ged exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters . &quot;
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received additional 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to perform in the following table . &quot;
an improvement in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown from the following table .
&quot; the decrease in the increase of FE@@ V is not significant over this period clin@@ ically , and the absolute lung @-@ volume increased more proportional to the height of increasing children . &quot;
&quot; of the 26 patients with an atomic atomic fact , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ ag mirrors in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was determined that remained constant until the study remained constant . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients suffering from a combined end@@ point , the frequency range of shoulder @-@ joint FE@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) was generally observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated by 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy so@@ unding form , and 4 with the middle @-@ run form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n during the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size of magn@@ itude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ run form , whereas in contrast to older patients with severe de@@ fle@@ eting form only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations were performed on a dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata to the G@@ ag mirrors in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be treated with patients who have difficulties with weekly int@@ fu@@ sions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of this two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate each new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug can be updated . &quot;
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar , similar to older and less strongly affected patients . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies in safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in unique gift , tox@@ icity at repet@@ itive gift and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data can be seen no special dangers for human beings . &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different medicines for cancer ) in patients who have no chemotherapy alone ( drug against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) has already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously did not have been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chemotherapy , as all@@ as several therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should be taken during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( a vitamin ) and obtain injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 . &quot;
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid level ) .
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed up or reduced the dose . &quot;
&quot; thus , the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form continues to be lighter than in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug with a longer period of time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; in a primary study of 456 patients , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a primary study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a other drug against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who did not receive chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were treated at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy first @-@ time survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients , in which cancer did not attack the record epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared to the same medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to transfer A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union . &quot;
each tank bottle must be activated with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injec@@ tor ( 9 mg / ml ) which makes a solution of 25 mg / ml .
&quot; the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or@@ sis is taken from the water bottle , and with a 0.9 % sodium chloride injec@@ tor ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
&quot; for patients with non @-@ small bronze bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the treatment has been given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid on the day . &quot;
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed the intake must be taken at least 5 doses and intake must be continued during the duration of the therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third time working cycle .
&quot; in case of patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; the al@@ physical phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose is necessary to be held by the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ug@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in Fig@@ ures 1 , 2 and 3 for AL@@ IM@@ TA than mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA to the patient &apos;s value &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ c@@ tiv@@ ating a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues at the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials showed no indication that patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ z@@ ren or in comparison to patients aged 65 years is an increased secondary risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to cause harmful and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min are not necessary to assume the recommended dose adjustments for all patients recommended . &quot;
data in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit and / or Trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in screening of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mass of bone and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered at a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te numbers back to a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neutral amounts , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ug@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ug@@ mat@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutr@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was taken care when a pre @-@ treatment was taken place with folic acid and vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ @-@ lac@@ tic measure ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ sized ren@@ al failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must be avoided for at least 2 days prior to therapy in the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens of 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDS with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients who occurred these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid collection in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ et must be weighed before the p@@ em@@ etry treatment .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and frag@@ ile events were generally reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated vitality substances ( except yellow fever , these vaccination is contra@@ cted ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible Schä@@ di@@ - the reproductive capacity is maintained by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be addressed before the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted on how to bring advice on the sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ logistics ( N@@ SA@@ IDS , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can result in a reduced p@@ eb@@ et@@ re@@ mit effect . &quot;
therefore be careful when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDS or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens of 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because there is no data regarding the re@@ ac@@ tionary potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ IDS , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of od@@ ine status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ cia .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected in an application in pregnancy severe birth defects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful dischar@@ ging for the mother and risk for the F@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ks@@ ability of reproductive capacity , men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment , advice regarding the sperm cells . &quot;
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in the breast milk and un@@ wanted effects can &apos;t be excluded .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ es@@ l@@ astic anti@@ fol@@ ate that improves its effect by stimul@@ ating the acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for the cell rep@@ lication .

&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , randomised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study from AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients with mal@@ onic Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oph@@ i@@ om , demonstrated that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients a clin@@ ically significant benefit to such patients who were only with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the test arm in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement in clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oph@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ yo@@ d@@ ess arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms flow through an improvement of lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the time of the control loop .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , randomised , open Phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;

both in a study on interaction of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ in was observed a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level .
&quot; in combination with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ otene remained in the standard . &quot;

&quot; animal experimental studies show no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the keys are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; + It is pl@@ au@@ sible , that the treatment with all@@ i can lead related to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ Über@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research and animal , based on research and animal can be assumed from a rapid recovery of systematic systematic effects that are attributable to the li@@ pas@@ cin@@ ating properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
therapeutic effect is based in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ ag@@ ente binding to the active serv@@ o rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies were derived from clinical trials , that 60 m@@ g. of or@@ list@@ at taken three times daily , which blocks absorption of about 25 % of food fet@@ al . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , placebo @-@ controlled trials with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 indicates the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ cr@@ ot@@ or , fatty acid . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( Table 1 ) and as proportion of those who have lost more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed in both studies , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total chol@@ est@@ ess was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value of 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

plasma concentration of non met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , the therapeutic doses of the plasma was not spor@@ adic or@@ list@@ at in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied at chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , and also with chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are the regular trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , chem@@ otherap@@ ies received which severe or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are severe trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting showed , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 from 223 ) , compared with 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed that 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the office of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in heavily em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate @-@ day chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
&quot; Alo@@ xi &apos;s efficacy of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the chemotherapy given by the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on age , patients with an@@ am@@ orous Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is offered with simultaneous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or those at such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eutic agent , Alo@@ xi is not used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after the chemotherapy treatment . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tes phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ elec@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ tr@@ ine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ g , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , ha@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; due to the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is necessary to treat the doctor &apos;s treat . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least possibly stood with Alo@@ xi in connection , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of sensiti@@ vely reactions and reactions to the administration site ( burning , curing , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing skills . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar levels of adverse events of adverse events of adverse events were observed ; there were no dose of action to observe . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received effect on Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ eric intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients were treated with a total of 6@@ 67 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ ber phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron that were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies involving moderate @-@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy and the study of heavily em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; clinical studies for chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the evidence of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block at the vent@@ ri@@ cul@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and the duration of the promotional potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
absorption After intraven@@ ous gift follows a slow elim@@ ination of plasma concentration a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average annual basis of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , at 11 Ho@@ den@@ ial cancer patients ranged from day 1 and day 5 measured middle concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations assumes that once a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron came to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after one consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max after the l@@ ump sum of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % of the kidneys have been eliminated , and about another 50 % will be converted into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron regarding less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abol@@ ition have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less@@ er extent that are involved in quanti@@ fication CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron had approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt , the total body length 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function distur@@ bs the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only according to ex@@ positions that are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use . &quot;
10 Out of prehistoric trials showed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose spoke in about the 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) that were given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ate incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the used high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi , the relev@@ ance of these results will be minimal . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ist En@@ forcement ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion on the approval of the approval of the approval of hepatitis C provided by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injec@@ tion@@ ing solution . &quot;
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on should be similar to a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hepatitis C ( one caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in case of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination , the liver tissue measures damages , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ an@@ in amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a le@@ es , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated , which is equivalent to the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data on the basis of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( mode structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of effect , safety and efficacy at hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the efficacy of reference case with 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks , as well as 6 months after the treatment of the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns were noted that data to stability of the mode and marketing of drugs did not suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease increased in more patients at the reference rate ; in addition Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test in the study was investig@@ ating the question of how far the medication is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with Kru@@ sten@@ formation ) and small in@@ fest@@ ations of in@@ firm@@ ities ( c@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ves ) to be applied and se@@ duc@@ ted wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because alarm against this type of infections may not be affected .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the surface area should not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment for two to three days , the doctor should again examine the patient and draw alternative treatments into consideration . &quot;
&quot; it acts by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial cells , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria . &quot;
the main inde@@ cent of the efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was dischar@@ ged after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were enrolled in placebo .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin tests , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates showed : when the results of both studies have been combined with skin tests , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were involved in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ duction ( eit@@ er@@ filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or from infection that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect of Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an appeal to the contractor .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist En@@ forcement ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go over the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections increases to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , needs or paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the office of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the patients , where there are no improvement within two to three days , are to be considered once more and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a sen@@ sibility or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is ab@@ orted carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials , secondary infected wounds was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which were reached by human application to top@@ ical skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of healthy adult men rose by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure according to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction hardened according to oral aging and are in@@ adequate in terms of impact on the birth and the f@@ og@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an systemic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; in the decision to continue whether the breast@@ feeding continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , between the benefit of the breast@@ plate for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effect of ir@@ rit@@ ation at the appointment site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a certain binding center of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oma , which diff@@ ers from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data show that the application of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ ties and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
&quot; due to binding to this bin@@ der bodies , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhibit@@ or , block @-@ binding inter@@ actions block inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to local prevalence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infectious disease , should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin vs. S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
absorption In a study with healthy adults was brought 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and down for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary in@@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were extracted . &quot;
the sampling took place 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the median time and between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake was lowered to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirts . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism , in vitro @-@ oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low interest of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies to oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) that were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid elements . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor male with female rats signs of restricted he@@ til@@ ity in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting from a maximum exposure to 5 times higher exposure than the highest exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic study of rats , at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development @-@ sto@@ x@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and maternal tox@@ icity were detected . &quot;

&quot; ambient is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years , which are not yet immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix is used as part of two doses of existing vaccine , with protection against hepatitis B possibly after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a lower risk of hepatitis B infection , and ensured that the vaccination plan can be carried out by two doses . &quot;
&quot; if an application dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by pro@@ ving the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix includes the same components as the registered vaccine Twin@@ rix adult since 1996 , and has been approved in Twin@@ rix Kinder since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protecting the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vaccine . &quot;
&quot; because ambient and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data on the application of Twin@@ rix are based , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month long and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of ger@@ minated children a month after the last injection for developing anti @-@ body concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a hex@@ agon and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , loss of appetite , pain on the injection , redness , Matcha ( fatigue ) as well as friction . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix may not react sensiti@@ vely to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a approval for the entry of ambi@@ rix in the entire category . &quot;
&quot; the standard tim@@ etable for the Grun@@ dig with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the appointment and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if an in@@ oc@@ ulation is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vacc@@ ines or combined with a combination sim@@ p . &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ IS ) anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as according to the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully secured whether immun@@ competent people who have addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - in@@ oc@@ ulation , as they may need to protect the immune system as protection as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 . for the rare cases of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction according to the gift of the vaccine appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring can always be available immediately .
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended with the Combin@@ ation sim@@ p of hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with distur@@ ban@@ ces in the immune system , a sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ body value is achieved , so in these cases the gift of other vaccination can be required . &quot;
&quot; as a intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration can lead to a sub@@ optimal pulse success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , ambi@@ rix can be in@@ jected from an exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous water as it can occur in these cases following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ous gifts . &quot;
&quot; when ambient in the second year of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , was administered to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ res@@ sy , or in patients with immun@@ o@@ gens must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted using 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , activity , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed during the previous Thi@@ omer@@ ano@@ - and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ines form@@ ulating was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and , for 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ p . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher levels of pain and Matcha based on a calculation base per vaccination , but not at a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of ambi@@ rix with 5@@ 9.1 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in patients according to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects were given to the Ambi@@ rix , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose Combin@@ ation@@ sim@@ p . &quot;
&quot; however , it was comparable to the frequency of Matcha ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects who received ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans combination ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of pronounced pain and activity was low and comparable to , which was observed after administration with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurr@@ ence of local inter@@ actions and general inter@@ actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to which with the 3 @-@ cans combination of hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection unit ) per dose , not pro commission . &quot;
&quot; the percentage of vacc@@ ines , which reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans @-@ vaccine schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units de@@ al@@ in@@ ine in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis - surface an@@ tigen was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials that were carried out at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 , the dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 , the dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people , whose immun@@ ity was able to be precious , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ting rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose regim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical comparison study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , obtained a month after the end of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ sch@@ ema with ambient or a 3 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ sch@@ ema with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for people who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ari@@ zation of 12 to 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months . &quot;
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens , which after vaccination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was detected in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ antibodies 24 months after immun@@ isation is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination scheme . &quot;
&quot; when the first dose of ambient in the second year is the first dose of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ani , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis / Hi@@ b ) or the first dose of a combined meas@@ u@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted using 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ization rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the Res@@ us@@ el@@ ding to investigate any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly do in@@ stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against an infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) an in@@ oc@@ ulation may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those after a hepatitis - or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; if you already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
an allergic reaction is expressed by it@@ ching skin strikes , bre@@ aths or swelling of the facial or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier in@@ oc@@ ulation against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / her child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , prior to the preparation of the second vaccine ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will guess you / your child from an in@@ oc@@ ulation with ambient atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of an effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of an re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced salary is usually given a month after the first dose , and is likely to give you a vaccine protection against the vaccination series . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is suffering from people who are in@@ jected to severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / her child are weak@@ ened with a disease or a treatment in your body &apos;s own defense or if you / your child moves to a her@@ me@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these people can &apos;t be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Be your doctor if you have given your child further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without ann@@ ot@@ ation ) or if you / your child recently been vacc@@ inated , or if your child is planned or that is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambient status , should be vacc@@ inated with separate places and as different lim@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , ambient or l@@ act@@ ating women is not administered , except it is urg@@ ently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you already have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

ambi@@ rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packages to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since issu@@ ing the first approval for the office of office , CH@@ MP represented the mind that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambient status remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since ambi@@ rix was only carried out in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to small patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with an un@@ completed enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentration ) .
ammon@@ ium is divided by several single doses to meals - swallowed up by the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ é ( through the stomach rug in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study that ammon@@ ium could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a p@@ seudo @-@ medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in addition to loss of loss , blood levels in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid re@@ ten@@ tion , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or , or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist Drug Administration ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ium is effective in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , too high ammon@@ ium values . &quot;
ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances . &quot; because of the condition of the condition of the condition of approval only limited information on this medicine .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ permanent form ( in@@ complete enzyme ) , which exists after the first life of life , an indication for the use in the history of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein toler@@ ant and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg , and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early mani@@ pulation of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ oplast@@ y or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a non @-@ arg@@ in@@ os@@ cin@@ ogen defect must be in@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with si@@ ck@@ disorders , as a risk for orig@@ ination of o@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets do not arrive immediately in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) containing sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with contra@@ cted heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium recur@@ tion and o@@ dem@@ ise lon@@ ging clinical conditions only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with external caution . &quot;
the importance of this results in regards to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS while pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indications ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it was also an delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ cted during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients showed at least an undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient which developed a met@@ ab@@ dic@@ ated en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ aci@@ azi@@ de , severe hypo@@ critical an@@ emia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ do@@ zation occurred in a five @-@ month old small child with a ver@@ itable single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate containing a dos@@ ing administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ ate with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram @-@ recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced .
it is important that the diagnosis has been early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ lic@@ ated , and the disease even led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their stu@@ ds @-@ free analog@@ y to death within the first life year . &quot;
&quot; due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic acet@@ ate ) , reduced the diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy during the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the period was with many too spiritual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late @-@ permanent form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy , and afterwards permanently reduced with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a diet reduced by a reduced rate of 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzymes , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were subjected to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in n@@ ul@@ ing healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) , or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic acet@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary disorders , or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ism was det@@ ectable according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after no@@ c@@ ere fasting , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic in plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the median phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrate on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts . &quot;
the drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated rats no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ gens ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken by oral ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing problems ) or on a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ac or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg , and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early mani@@ pulation of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ oplast@@ y or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when R@@ atten@@ dees were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of the brain rin@@ d . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient which developed a met@@ ab@@ dic@@ ated en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ aci@@ azi@@ de , severe hypo@@ critical an@@ emia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore ideal as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight .
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product uniqu@@ ely for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient must receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so that they could not ex@@ ert the nit@@ rous waste of waste products that can not ex@@ ert itself after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must notify AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; taking care of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines , or recently taken care of prescription drugs . &quot;
during the breast@@ feeding you don &apos;t take the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could survive in the breast milk and could hurt your baby .
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste problems , re@@ jection of hearing , des@@ ori@@ enti@@ veness , memory disorders , and wor@@ sen@@ ing existing neurolog@@ ical responses were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms in yourself , sit down immediately with your doctor or with the emergency opening of your hospital in relation to an appropriate treatment in connection . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example , in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac disease ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lifting &quot; ( an abnormal measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac gram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in some gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ ar@@ ine ( another Anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I , in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients treated by a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ ar@@ . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox must not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart failure . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ist Drug Administration ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted companies The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the office of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) for an emergency access or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous relief of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; in case of the patient , a PCI is carried out in another row , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the input to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; directly before the procedure , a quantity of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of these intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the input . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and di@@ lu@@ te medicine should be carefully mixed and administered quickly . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT &apos;s value is more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer necessary , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is properly administered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney @-@ related restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated by a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to check for the second Bol@@ us@@ dose after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage caused by the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT lay 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be carried out 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous treatment of un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated Hep@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous barrier of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
&quot; • well @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other components or against brain damage caused by a distur@@ b@@ ating hyper@@ tension , and / or ir@@ reversible hyper@@ tension . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients &quot;
&quot; patients are carefully monitor during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood flow , especially when bees is administered in combination with another Anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most bleeding may occur in most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture , patients who occur to per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be realized in order to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in returned to the treatment existing prior to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ tics ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates ) can be assumed that these substances are increasing the risk of bleeding . &quot;
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ tics are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in each case regularly .
&quot; the experimental tests are in@@ adequate in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development insufficient ( see under section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either in@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated Hep@@ ar@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups in the treated groups , women , and patients over 65 years , was more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measures for heavy bleeding like in the table of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred within Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less frequently than in groups with Hep@@ ar@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ oral , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular pressure level of ≥ 4 g / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure level , a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding locations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; Pun@@ ishment , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ wer , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information on side effects are based on data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients , which are subjected to a PCI . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the compar@@ ative group of compar@@ ative groups in women , as well as patients over 65 years , was more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
&quot; both light and severe bleeding compet@@ ed under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported following extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organs in table 6 . &quot;
in the case of an over@@ do@@ zation the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is stopped immediately and the patient is eng@@ aging with regard to signs of bleeding .
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ der , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ dium region of Th@@ rom@@ bin , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ rom@@ bin is bound in the liquid phase , or to Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at Th@@ rom@@ bin , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ rom@@ bin is slowly asc@@ ending the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby ensuring the function of the active centre of Th@@ rom@@ bin re@@ generated . &quot;
&quot; moreover , by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients in which it has come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , did not induc@@ ing any th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ocy@@ tes action . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in showed a dos@@ is@@ - and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is used by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the patient below , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the inputs to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study it was administered un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated hepat@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ gen in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting color ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or at the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or by the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required an angi@@ ography were distributed within 72 hours , evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring Isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ gone within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ genetic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in were evaluated in patients who underwent a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is in the amino acid @-@ compound in its amino acid components with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body @-@ pool .
&quot; the primary Met@@ abo@@ lit , which resulted from the division of the Arg@@ 3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ season sequence by th@@ rom@@ bin , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ rom@@ bin . &quot;

&quot; based on conventional studies in safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gifts , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , or reproduction hardened , the pre @-@ clinical data can be seen no special dangers for human beings . &quot;
tox@@ icity in animals at repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks in a exposure of up to 10 % of the clinical Ste@@ ady state @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to an excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as a continuous fusion with a insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work effective .
&quot; is@@ lan@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly different from human@@ kind , and the change means that it works faster and shorter life time has a short @-@ effective human@@ kind . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body can &apos;t produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ elled hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % with insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who already have a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can be applied to the blood glucose level . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH for approval from A@@ pi@@ dra to the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal cav@@ ity .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin delivery , the insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the mode of strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , insulin delay ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ adequate dosage or ab@@ duction of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ chi@@ azi@@ des ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
&quot; the change@@ over of a patient to another insulin type , or a insulin @-@ type device should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required . &quot;
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the used is@@ ine and can therefore change when switching the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , reduc@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ xide ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ z@@ yl@@ ate , and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , symptoms of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as dec@@ ep@@ ti@@ ers , cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reserve the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ parts can be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments on reproduction har@@ dening showed no differences between in@@ su@@ icides and human@@ kind in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine re@@ acts into human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur in the breast milk , still it is res@@ or@@ ating after oral application . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical trials listed in which undes@@ ired pharmac@@ ists are listed , sorted by system organs and sorted : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ( frequency based on @-@ available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy Will fails to switch the injection unit within the injection range , can occur in the result of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy on the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be treated using an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which will be treated according to a doctor by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glucose in@@ ject , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ - cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin resistance occurs faster and the amount of time is shorter than hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ resistance showed insulin @-@ relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , a proportional rise in the glucose processing effect , just like human@@ kind . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast active effect as a normal human@@ kind and achieves the complete glu@@ ed effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ kind .
&quot; data from the data was intenti@@ onally , that with an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post@@ pran@@ ational gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , the insulin was reached in 2 minutes before the meal was achieved . it was achieved a better post @-@ den@@ ounce control than with human normal insulin ( 2 minutes before meal ) . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human normal control , which is given to 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the start of the meal , which was given 30 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) , as well as compared to human@@ kind ( figure 1A ) , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery is 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - down@@ wards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human@@ kind Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) . &quot;
