<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for injecting (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), misstrust and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic illness in which patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternate with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past, Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioral problems when oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients where the swallowing of tablets difficulties are prepared."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients receiving other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole works probably mainly as part of "participates" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiforzol is such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower measurements when neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder plays a role, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of brain, eliminating psychotic or manical symptoms and will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, the resumption of the symptoms, was investigated in three studies by up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased agitation, compared to a period of two hours with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify received over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which were stabilised to prevent the manian symptoms with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectioning was found in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder affecting at increased agitation which compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scope for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets, and the solution to be absorbed (up)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injector detachment, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly stronger the symptoms of increased agitation than patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the reperceptive episodes of patients who actually treated patients and if additionally was administered to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in 10- or 15-mg doses, Abilify injections also reduced the symptoms of increased agitation and were similarly effective as Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common adverse events of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsy (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), anxiety, Nausea (nausea), anxiety, Nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, rusomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humanist agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to serious manic episodes of patients who had mostly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiforzol spoke to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioral problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder, when a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the office of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode of patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiforzol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily irrespective of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patient, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify that (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction has been removed from combination therapy, the arithmeatzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicides is one of psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the onset of an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder showed no increased suicides risk with Aripidarzol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be applied to treat patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial or ischemic heart failure, cardiac insufficiency, convection disorders, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiforzol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if with ABILIFY treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis, should be drawn into consideration, reduce the dose or to break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"hence, Aripiforzol should be used in patients with seizures in anamol or at states that are associated with crispruptions in connection with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years old with Aripiforzol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiforzol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixer dosing, a significant relationship between the dosing and the response to unwanted distorted events with Aripiforzol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazide or hyperosmolarem coma, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia related events, with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic active ingredients that allow direct comparissions."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar deficiency, the application of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as side effect, and may lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripia zol on the central nervous system, caution is offered when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overly side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripidarzol, whereby this effect is not considered sounding."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) recorded the AUC by Aripipezol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to be that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetin, similar effects have, and therefore similar dosing reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolitioners can result common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiforzol. compared to CYP2D6 extensively-intensive metallization.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should survive the potential risks for patients."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should be similar effects and therefore similar dosing reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting up the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose above the companion of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with ABILIFY and can be calculated with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"clinical trials showed a significant impact on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodological morphine), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">People should come to inform their doctor if she will pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiforzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the inadequate data situation to the human being and due to the reproductive studies at the animal, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripidarzol has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant-side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hematalysis treatment with Aripiforzol, however, it is unlikely that hematalysis has a high plasma processor in the treatment of a transdovization."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiforzol in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT2a receptors are mediated on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT2a receptor and 5HT7- to alpha-1-adrengen and to the histamine-alpha receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">"during the gift of Aripidzzol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg. a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dosisdependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and the cleaning."</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a Haloperidol controlled study in week 52, the proportion of the patients suffering from the study were similar in both groups (Aripidarzol 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>

<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate, which amounted to 34% in the Aripiforzol group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, with the primary degree of weight gain (N = 18 or 13% of the valuable patient rate), there was significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg."</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazol to placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixer or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripidarzol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol showed a substantial effect on placebo was comparable to placebo with lithium or Haloperidol per week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also pointed out 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study on 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks not on lithium or valproat monotherapy found a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to the monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>

<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydrification and Hydroxyde for Aripiforzol, the N-Dealkyation is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiforzol with extensive metallization of CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolitioners via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripidzole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, likewise at an pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients do not have sex dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation for pharmacokinetics revealed a reference to clinically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the effects of the noise on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiforzol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinegenetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiforzol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with various gradient liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiforzol and Dehydro-Aripidarzol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw snobles at their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional clinical trials, toxicity at repeated administration, toxicity, genotoxicity, and for canoogenic potential, the preclinical data had no particular dangers for people."</seg>
