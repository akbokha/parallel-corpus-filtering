&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by using these lighter . &quot;
for more information on the use of &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings stored , select the map tools and select the desired modules there . &quot;
this is a list of standard modules from the K@@ DE package ; add @-@ ons . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; click on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of r@@ amps , if present , er@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; the module filters ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar below ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current work directory on different kind of filter . &quot;
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the just displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root mark of the document , example : an item , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View , for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; displays a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; exists in it , emb@@ ell@@ ished folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rectangle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder is mir@@ ro@@ red , whereby the size of a file is defined as the sum of the size of entries is specified . according to this way , large files can be recognized even if it can be viewed in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands you be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation possess the rec@@ tan@@ gles of reasonable color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rectangle , which is switched over to color mode , can be either deep for the easy detection of the screw loop or the picture of another file as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or file &apos;s file . for each property you can specify if there is enough space available , or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates may occur if necessary , you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; in the algorith@@ ms algorith@@ ms for tre@@ em@@ aps should rule the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always available . note that there is no longer available entries , which is then square for the frame if the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the surface of a entry for the lower items takes place , the implementation will be placed . here it is for the labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to constantly advant@@ ageous to divide the areas as possible . the best methods of these are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal representation for one entry over the menu entry . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn into the area of the above entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was originally designed as small test application and introduction to the use of the tre@@ map wid@@ gets that was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d . &quot;

&quot; there is a project which is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ vings , you would like to answer any questions about other users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ vings ; and hopefully we would like to answer any questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , you should also be powerful . &quot;
&quot; you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ance ; homepage , visit news about shared releases and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants ; to learn . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; registration in the developer mailing list . guide to report in the developer mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ans ; .
&quot; if you come &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can simply add a local , remote or remote folder . simply type p@@ ad@@ names or click the folder icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data can be stored . this path remains equal to all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add so many folder as you would like to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you will also use as an al@@ ant library . settings di@@ gi@@ k@@ am setting collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top file , the image containing as base folder . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; dur@@ al recur@@ sive the li@@ br@@ arian li@@ ad in its whole depth . you can do not exclu@@ de sub@@ folder as it is a box in a plug @-@ in folder . you can do an extraordinary and di@@ gi@@ ate ; do not add an point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing file with photos as basic folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will not take photos as symbols . you can change that any any photo from the album and then use it on the folder symbol . more details can be found in the records . &quot;
&quot; once you configure the base file , you can set in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you should learn to set your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ vers : if you use the rough mode of your camera , you may handle it ; possibly support the support based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you can find a list of supported raw cameras in the help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ supported . &quot;
how to setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you with your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; -@@ albums can be downloaded from the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work together with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ve@@ . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as a turn@@ out device . the camera can be realized also via the Picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; uses the program G@@ Photo@@ 2 to communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , more broad@@ able software collection for digital cameras supporting a far more common protocol that supported by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras and other peripher@@ als without the need additional driver . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and transfers via the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 by . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . the EX@@ IF support will not be read out of some lib@@ ations of lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may have pre@@ umb@@ nails for nothing , or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ans ; is how easy to expand its functionality :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ bility ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ m@@ g. and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in almost any way , as it may be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; due to writing a small module to complement one function , when changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either change the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;

&quot; of course , the normal soldering actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire such as F4 File Edit .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main character are available for both th@@ umb@@ nails in the lumin@@ ary . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can detect on the crossed path . in order to push the visible area of the image , you have to keep this an@@ gled and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as in other views . just use the zoom regulator under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ oleum in the image in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital project management - away from the fashion capital ? digital data management considers any part of the process , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital data management . but most of us do not make it in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photographs of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ate ; we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , optimize , evaluate , optimize , optimize , wait , and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , em@@ ph@@ atically , trans@@ forms , trans@@ duc@@ ed and exported , and exports to a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata , according to your definition data , provide information about or a documentation of other data , which are managed by a application or surroundings . &quot;
&quot; I could claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not need to find a certain photo anymore . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you don &apos;t know how many photos you don &apos;t want to save &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you can easily access them with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you have to do and know what to do in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you have to decide if you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . tourist images can be found quickly via your memory location . if you have enough photos , you will be able to use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . separ@@ ating new files from old files .
separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata to save in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this then you can then select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database to select the appropriate point in the menu .
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? it provides &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ate editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now you start the real work as you now need to select each photo keywords , labelling and a review . of course , you can select all the pictures that will need the same attribute . this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with key@@ word , key@@ word , how to proceed with other programs often , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalog@@ ed images from another source with embedded sampling , then add the pictures to the right place . the re@@ sorting of the hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pressing a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be followed by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; updated while the sub@@ trees are persecuted . &quot;
&quot; the graphics shows like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation , because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords : the next section refers to certificates or comments , the third important tool to catalog@@ u@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to let most don &apos;t let your photos show simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , you &apos;ll begin to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the labelling therefore has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story about the viewer , helping to help you about the motive that you have to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is OK if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself only .
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ate , you can save a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alpha bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . you can even export your pictures to your wishes in the Lab@@ eling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you &apos;ll have to tell the story about your wishes in the Lab@@ eling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train runs the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already un@@ counting and become more competitive in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , you can virtually retri@@ eve your travel with geographical data . you can also export the pictures at the entrance site . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ came ; as information should be deposited on :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , for example , if it is not requested , the name of a company or organisation can be saved , then it cannot be changed . this field does not support com@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples can be titles , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a comment on the author of the author , this must be also completed . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ dder field to identify who offers photo . if the photographer wants to be listed here , this organizations can be listed here . if the picture is an inventory , this is the picture / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although this does not offer protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has no more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this problem is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique in a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in the near future such a module for st@@ acking processing is available .
&quot; topics : record errors , turn@@ outs , power poles , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ating , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data collection company , has some interesting statistics showing a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous must be treated and you can &apos;t buy some more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course you can claim some more difficult and more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your monitor . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good Dis@@ ks and good recording sessions and are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . so it &apos;s about to choose the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you are just written . 75 % of the data is just effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the control environment . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the For@@ mat@@ s against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB , thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; burn it slowly with a good admission application to qualit@@ atively high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . please read the media with a description , date &amp; author attributes and afterwards protected site . don &apos;t forget to read the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
dis@@ cos keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer of manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study about the trouble mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ missing &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ cos keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature range , the error rate can not determine . some of SM@@ ART will not termin@@ ate this error . these are especially readers and publishing coun@@ ters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a current case before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment do not account a lot , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed spro@@ ckets can be different . these can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hard@@ ship age , devast@@ ated Mot@@ her@@ boards and other defects . so , protect themselves from the inev@@ itable which leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy supply is absorbed and the rest is available . it normally does not think any plug @-@ in bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects against lighten@@ ing , and thus protects the correct devices . &quot;
&quot; since there can be over@@ voltage of any cable to your computer , you should consider that all peripher@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms that also contain a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection of the modem . so you are ideal for the go . &quot;
while a Over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of adverse data . therefore it can be useful to invest in a under@@ break@@ able power supply .
&quot; in addition to protection against over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can provide automatic charging power when a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to store up and the system works again . if you get a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety in power disorders with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you remember how good your computer should be protected . at the end you should always remember all cables before you go into holiday .
&quot; the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , you are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com will provide online memory services that are limited to photos . your free memory is available to you , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP Protocol , and with the large firms there is a backup and a partial memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are due for transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data base between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . it is quite worried about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data road than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transfers , since they produce inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transfers , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS provided by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle with turn@@ tables on a low level and can be scal@@ able . it is open source with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . you can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available .
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha status . it is still used in alpha status , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the core . &quot;
&quot; do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for job systems . at not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it is currently limited to lower damage , such as theft or new installations ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer had been sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good english article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic of all kinds of light sensors are no longer far away from this border . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras will go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result , the optimized for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a high @-@ quality look at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel resolution . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; today , you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other data loss for data loss . thus , you can use your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous than the re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash beats you if the drive was not connected during the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disin@@ teg@@ ration means always not local storage . bring your back up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or the like . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already said is a more common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , you can save that one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all the files shall be secured . it is a moment , without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
&quot; differentiation : securing the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete moment on two time points : the complete backup , and the final differentiation . &quot;
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it was only swi@@ vel@@ ed and not continuously . &quot;
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety over ssh . &quot;
ensure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to detect losses and restore back . at the same time you come to backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for every month . each additional di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file , IP@@ TC information , associ@@ ating X@@ MP files , original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable images will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time span that you really interested in you are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able because of your nature , everything must be said to be careful with caution and re@@ evaluate it while the current system is gone backward . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask ones@@ elf like the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system , it is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
&quot; scal@@ ability is the subject pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size , meaning that it is always enlarged . &quot;
&quot; let us assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with set plans and put the area for you to enlarge . at * ni@@ x Systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put it on a new record : &quot;
&quot; check the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it up . &quot;
/ dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source which the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no software that can read it then you can create this . this task will be easier to year by year .
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that van@@ ishes slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard to replace the G@@ IF . however , it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the down@@ side is that there is relative many administration information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs to save your images . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression @-@ free compression . a problem is however , that this format has been adapted for many people . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format designed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed based on the need of met@@ ad@@ ata . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is required for use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the compet@@ itor Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; imag@@ ery resources ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is used by extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the shell format . X@@ MP fits the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file , and as mentioned above , the shell format is possible . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and place all there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core met@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which is a large range of applications and modelling , discussions and general efforts in the D@@ CM@@ I @-@ communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card readers or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your resource archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs . if you want to edit the pictures with &amp; di@@ gi@@ bility , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut under the other programs under circumstances . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright law with a digital water@@ mark . export them to Web@@ gal@@ eries , add in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; in the section adding a photos to an album , you can add a description of how you have already on your hard disk . the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ ate bank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; connect this to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode , and turn it on . another description will be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig indicator will appear at the bottom and the appearance of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras are not displayed on the bottom and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music , etc . &quot;
&quot; before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to download the camera information on each entry . with the lateral features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a updated or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that are stored on the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded from your computer . note that in some digital cameras , you do not have all information available . &quot;
&quot; the met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remarks , GPS etc. of the image . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side panel from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants ; or the image editing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their computer , click the button to download and then select the selection from ALL . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; we will be sure to check the photos stored in an album before you delete photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can choose the desired option of &amp; K@@ DE ; as soon as you select the photos , you can download the button and then choose chosen button . the button Selected is chosen as long as you select a few photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ p . in this case , the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you select the buttons all download or selected , a dialogue with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are sorted out . the list of existing albums can be displayed in the section &quot; My albums . &quot; then select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you downloaded the desired photos , you can er@@ ase these from the camera . you can delete all of the delete delete any delete . if you want to delete only a few , you must first select this first and delete delete files chosen . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no option that you have deleted from the camera to restore . the photos will not be deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the photos successfully into a &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; if you want to delete the camera system completely , you should make this much faster than that of camera . &quot;
&quot; cameras are often used as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually checked after the photos from the camera . so this may be useful , the date and time that was made on which the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirrors of the picture and for data base bases . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transmission opens three more options to be carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied into the IP@@ TC @-@ field . with the final option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use another date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . turn off the option date &amp; time . for more custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the commands str@@ at@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; for a photo is used , the camera is displayed in preview . your settings will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ate ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to capture an automatic rotation during the time . not all cameras put this information ready . in the section page Metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and when your camera is not delivered , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera &apos;s information about the date , where the photo was made , you can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; this sub@@ stitution is based on image data . not all cameras will be downloaded in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will be available in the same sub@@ album . in the page side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information your camera could be embedded into the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button Advanced and select the option file @-@ based under@@ score at the bottom end of the window . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos from their computer on their camera is the button download . then select up@@ loading . the file list dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears in which you can select the files that can be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you , where the pictures are uploaded . a file @-@ selection dialog for the camera is released . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be shown in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude , and can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic spot . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ to@@ graphic the area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; users want to locate the place of photos , it is good to depic@@ t the position data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 is supported by many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and recently over the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers together . either as card module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be stored with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save these data but in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment . &quot;
&quot; there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itud@@ inal or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of applied coordinates using map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com presents no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ bility . to access this settings , you have to change in the Settings menu . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot;
&quot; you can select a preview of advertis@@ ements or image processing . put the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants ; firm , when you click on one entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standards of standards and copyright data . these data will be automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . also , these data will be syn@@ ced to the IP@@ TC @-@ fields . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this may include names , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author as such as Reuters or Associated Press . if the picture is an inventory , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ der@@ s. by this , the met@@ ad@@ ata will permanently contain in the image and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; imported without lost . &quot;
&quot; store images as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos using the images embedded in images . attention : in pictures that have already been inscri@@ ptions , they are over@@ written by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window rests on a file . depending on the option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ ore ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types and di@@ gi@@ gi@@ p ; to display , you can add the file expansion of this list and removal of any file in one &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no of these extensions , ignored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; to default settings , you can reset the default settings by pressing the button Update from each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ore ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can use it here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the picture editing , this set mode can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images can be encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next declaration . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . thus , 1 : a low and 9 means high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the T@@ IF@@ F @-@ files option , you can switch the de@@ hydr@@ ate sal@@ on@@ ism for T@@ IF@@ F pictures . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is less @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; with the loss of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ bility , the image processing is only a picture @-@ looking for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool to mani@@ pulation your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the idle speed is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option features a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 gene expression with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white component uses the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white @-@ devi@@ ates is not set . standard , it is a solid color balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . by using the second sensors , the effect that sub@@ str@@ ated images will get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the peak white in the settings . last@@ ly , you can re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not so fast le@@ pers like green and red . therefore try the missing green and red percentage of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how many color or white you want .
&quot; selecting the option , you get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; put the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you &apos;ll probably need to set it a bit higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; di@@ gi@@ bility ; to keep the time for the demo icing , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; an Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process , to calculate a complete picture from the partial image sensor that displays many cameras and the one matrix @-@ coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w came in ; and D@@ cra@@ w places you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color paintings on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color soft@@ ening correction , as it is carried out during the conversion . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information , and there are instructions such as these should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants ; information such as the color information of a colour space in the other are so accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior Questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with rough files .
&quot; color Profile @-@ folder S@@ ing here to the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / color / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; examined this folder , during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed after opening the Roh@@ file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or ar@@ gy@@ ms . here are only your paintings are not managed by the entire screen .
&quot; the input profile should be used to the camera manufacturers and model which are using . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color tone or gamma correction . this means that you do not need to perform the color scheme itself . &quot;
&quot; there are further options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be given by one device . this is very useful , since your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , instead of leaving your printer to the blind algorithm . &quot;
for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately not for the models of Canon . this is why a table of cameras and profiles are fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially :
&quot; the Canon Profile extension makes the style for the finish : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; picture @-@ looking and imag@@ inations ; many modules support , which were written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use and they will then be loaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; these modules appear as new entries in the main menu , and additionally you will find some also in context menu . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can be set in the menu below settings . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project in htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org , or the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper control is adjusted the time between the imag@@ inations , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switch the met@@ ad@@ ata a res@@ p or from the bottom end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera characteristics show a list of all cameras supported on the left side . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is connected to a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , here are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera that you have to put on your camera here . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; you need to connect the camera with your computer , put them in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out , whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main character . if you own more than one camera you can add all here .
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for the shift of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ mer display , you can set the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; in the delete of a photos in an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be sil@@ ently through &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; applied , if you use the option to use changes in the right side bar without rel@@ ays . otherwise , you must save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also stop the display of the welcome center of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; at the starting interru@@ ption . this acceler@@ ates the starting procedure of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ate under circumstances .

the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ve@@ ; you are therefore not part of your distribution . more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in section Image Processing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size is shown . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , among them the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before you save the Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you &apos;ve saved the picture . &quot;
&quot; so you might need to make a copy of your image , before you change it . this allows you to save with file save . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by restore from the menu file or restore the button . you lose every change that you have done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
&quot; virtually every action of image processing can be re@@ produced or restored , and the last action you can get back@@ wards by choosing re@@ work or re@@ produced by choosing re@@ produce from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for back@@ rest and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB , you can press a moment longer in the tool@@ bar or restore a moment . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be re@@ produced or restored in between . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made any changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save this . &quot;
you can set in the photo and come out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ oleum or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the c@@ auti@@ ous menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the tool@@ bar . usually , you can also call this tool@@ bar ; you can also call this in the installation dialog of &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; see this section on setting the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image files and receive the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can print here the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole sentences . all image preview can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard you need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected images available . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation system , also available in image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is attached : &quot;
multiple click on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar and disappear again into the edge .
&quot; in the labelling view , you can enter the remark below . note the remark below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed . the labels will be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data supports only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters , and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should notice these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you comments , use either the button or switch to the next image , the labelling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . however , this will always be performed when you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings that is always written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation is showing an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting order . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard dial C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . evaluate multiple pictures simultaneously , select this out and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word views shows a search box to fil@@ let the keywords , the j@@ wor@@ d@@ tree , and a select box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; -@@ session ar@@ ted key@@ word . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is adapted to dynam@@ ically . you can easily restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word fast . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief for the input of sampling in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all words of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
&quot; select if several pictures are selected in the main view , and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you have a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the main window frames . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and view@@ points . if additionally one or more key@@ word filter is used in the right hand , only the quantity of these two will be displayed . all samples are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also pull and shut down tags . if the key@@ word has been selected , you can easily pull them out with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can easily put it from the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialog appears if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on one calendar day . the key@@ word filter is based on no keywords . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that , a key@@ word from the right hand @-@ tree has been dra@@ gged on the selection and set there . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word is to be set . &quot;
&quot; this search for changes takes place at any start of the program , you can also be switched off with settings . &quot;
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or later , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or a string which is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can choose a extended search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check@@ box at the end of the rule and then turn the button group@@ ing . the options look like this : &quot;

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly used &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you have a color @-@ administered workflow is the colors that you can have a pre@@ dict@@ able deviation from the actually photographic or sc@@ anned colors . you can print the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners . you can print or publish the colours of your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to express what buttons it has to press for the results . unfortunately , the sense of this tut@@ orials is to provide you sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions with you the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image is filled with all the criteria listed in the six below , you must not take care of color management . &quot;
you can work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ color space . ( see further information below )
&quot; your only other image expend@@ itu@@ res are per e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB of de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB doesn &apos;t work so well , and the life for everyone is so easy , why should you use another colour space to make your thoughts on dy@@ es ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the RGB of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ eder @-@ shaped region , and colours in the RGB colour space , the three square region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms superb page and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to replace my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the RGB colour space or not , you &apos;ll need to monitor your monitor . so you have to monitor your monitor . if you &apos;re using the RGB output of s@@ RGB , you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool introduces five automatic correc@@ tions to improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before you try a further manual processing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automation and contrast extend from the menu of Cor@@ rec@@ ate Automatic correction will automatically attempt to make the best of your colors . you will experiment with these effects , to see which works best at your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled leuk@@ emia values over the entire image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sha@@ ding . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; the same : this method is adjusted the lumin@@ ous factor of the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is as flat as possible . it is the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that works either miracles in a picture or destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automated : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and bright mar@@ gins and adjust the rot@@ or , green and blue channels on the entire history gramm@@ ar area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by shifting the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ans ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white @-@ like photos .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color , so if you can do too far from the original picture , if you can perform the white down@@ stream in rough mode , if you are working in the 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white @-@ equ@@ in@@ fusion of the copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . they start the menu entry in white colours .
&quot; the window window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image and preview can be seen as well as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ ch , then it &apos;s enough to click on the window . &quot;
the preview of the target group features a red markers . the lumin@@ ance of the Pi@@ pe under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynamic is changed once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because , even in well @-@ lighted pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . sha@@ dows Adjust@@ ment lets you improve your photos of your photos or down . &quot;
&quot; with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned inspec@@ tions , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere you select the image color for the calculation of the colour temperature of the white . on this type , the temperature and green values are also set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; the over@@ load capacities increases the colors , when more than a colour channel of the pi@@ geon is over@@ exposed . it will display the combined earnings in the white image . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading do exactly this . every setting of the Weiß@@ ab@@ normal@@ ities you have set to store you in a text file and then re@@ charge again later .
&quot; the button pre@@ ferences set aside all filter values to their standard values and the associated neutral white ab@@ normal@@ ities . please note that neutral settings will be a different photo as your original . if you store this , your original image is changed . &quot;
&quot; here you can adjust the co@@ di@@ spro@@ cket per colour channel of the processed picture . however , it is better suited to high quality images . however , this coding requires even more turn@@ tables , calculation time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of resource files . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour tension can be carried out through the window frame for the usage of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu in color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error . in the manual on audio correction , you can find further information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; tool color effects gives you four color effects , a solar cell effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the picture was developed when one partially developed the development of the picture . the result was a partial negative aspect of the picture , and the result was a partial negative image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting impact well . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is possible . another increase is finally generated with a negative image that is not shown on photography . &quot;
this is an example of the solar cell effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited intensity is 30 % .
Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optim@@ ised colour film by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and this is a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , the characteristics are also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those barely visible landscapes , too much . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result , and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions to the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . in large pictures the filter can ski@@ p the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of photos correct . once you are pleased with the result , you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the converted problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple leuk@@ emia / contrast / gamma , the tool is rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ated for improving the exposure . even if the dialog appears on this tool very complicated , you need to explain the range of application only the range of sliding . concrete the three shooting down below the hist@@ o@@ program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sliding stamps are cli@@ cked and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to control the control is to post@@ p@@ one the kno@@ b , and make sure how the image changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the picture , updated . on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set , whether the hist@@ ogram is dominated by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic graduation is useful . &quot;
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones often called Gam@@ ma@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; the three paint spra@@ ins can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the input of the sha@@ dows , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output : the output rate allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ cks that can be used in order to evaluate the output rate , e.g. the compression of the output can be used for example , to create something different in the background . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in depen@@ dency of the image values . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and later re@@ charged . in addition , Gim@@ p levels is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will be automatically adjusted for all sha@@ dows , means and Sundays . then activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to set the input of the history program for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load @-@ coating controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the integration of the intervention in the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output levels are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be re@@ updated dynam@@ ically dependent on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; modification channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel , which will be modified by the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols are located between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps to log@@ arith@@ mic mode . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short track to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , you can see that this bright tones can be correspon@@ d@@ ded with dark ab@@ normal@@ ities and the corresponding image pixel dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value , create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you can create that in the file system can be stored and later re@@ charged . file format is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ ven@@ format . &quot;
&quot; if you want this method and the three colour pi@@ ps buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and Sundays . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to use the control points for the rot@@ or , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load @-@ coating controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture which has been fixed in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; image editing is a tool to improve the colour channels , or to change the colour sha@@ des of the photos . &quot;
&quot; the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can process it from the menu colors channel mixer , edit images . &quot;
&quot; select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and rash . the top section of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison via the own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you move this in the picture shows a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; controls for the module are on the right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also enable L@@ umin@@ ance , this image is particularly convenient , as you can also reduce the corresponding color components , because the channel bl@@ ender will then reduce the output of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color becomes a visible cat@@ ches , which occurs from the color channel and their smoke pattern in each channel is different . if that &apos;s the case you can reduce your Mon@@ ochro@@ me converting to the skin . &quot;
&quot; the store and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setup can be stored for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load @-@ coating controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascin@@ ated because of your abstra@@ ction . the development of digital photography is black / white a work step since color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film profile profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lenti@@ l filter . this looks good for all the scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange @-@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ te . &quot;
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ tic effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ ry to day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates warm bright and medium tones whilst he added a bit of cold in the shadow of a prints and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus resem@@ bling the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
use the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; tool texture may apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an old master on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture may use the image processing . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed below ( 2 ) . the string of relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; tool frames can be added , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
&quot; the eye of an observation in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task . to keep his attention , it is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started out of image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . perme@@ ate it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , adding it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , adding a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
&quot; width : width of frame in percent , width is limited to 1 % to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; this will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you &apos;ve used the tool After aspect ratio previously . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple to form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture in any case . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the bigger the picture you need . at the end , choose a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the picture is finished . &quot;
&quot; every attitude which you have chosen for your text may be changed until you click on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; tool sten@@ cil template , you can put a template on a picture . &quot;
the menu template templates are used in image processing can be used to lay template on a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there is no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you have to add the P@@ NG file format and should add the file size of the template . if you want to add your template &apos;s file size and you should simply send an email in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ p @-@ user @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noticed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view , which automatically reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil file . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , there are three buttons with whom you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button is enlarged by the bottom image . it is used to cent@@ ered the position of mouse . check it with the left button .
&quot; shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the underlying picture . if you want to use the template on the whole image , you &apos;ll need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left click button . &quot;
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to post@@ p@@ one picture below the template . take the image and place it in the desired position .
&quot; OK if you want to use the template on your image , then the image will be adapted automatically . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; offers three different tool for sharp@@ ening . each of you have advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges in order to make a picture sharp@@ ened . actually it &apos;s not a little bit , it works rather psych@@ audi@@ ovis@@ ell . you can use it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; it is possibly the best of the three , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus and most digit@@ ised images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is the fact that the digit@@ isation process can be printed with just minimum differences to a color point . the same phenomenon will be observed even if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras will usually need more retro@@ spec@@ tively sharp@@ ening as normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG image , a camera internal sharp@@ ening was used frequently . however , images in the base format must always be sharp@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; some scanners turn a sharp@@ ening filter during the reading of the image . if you enable this de@@ activate , you will receive control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo of sharp@@ ening ke@@ yst@@ ers . you can call the menu entry with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; but you should be careful to circum@@ vent the results , as the results are not very natural . sharp@@ ening the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the sound system . in general , you will find more information about the menu entry cor@@ relate . under recur@@ ring , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is significantly easier than it . use the tool to sof@@ ten soft@@ ness and experiment with settings . the window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter in@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help edit the image . the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values are often good results and should first be tried again . if you make the correct mask to make the effect , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges are possible . &quot;
&quot; the radius displays how many pixels are affected by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should make pictures best in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image , added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the corresponding difference . one can define a minimum difference thus for a channel of filters . in this way , areas with a soft transition between sharp@@ ness and therefore beauty errors can be avoided in faces , cel@@ ery and water surface . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; tool Re@@ focus is focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected un@@ folding filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool tries to make a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing system ; it is a better approach to sharp@@ ening images . it is used to make a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ as . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ as . it is used to run a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ as . you can start @-@ focus on the menu by moving colors . &quot;
&quot; in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ission is also a very long tail , which leads far from the original qu@@ ell@@ as , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel , which is affected by far from the distant pixel . caused un@@ wanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameters for use of this module . for most of the pictures the default value should be 1 good results . you can make a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp then but then on Heiligen@@ damm .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 is very poor . if the space filter is too low ; the image quality is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still decor@@ ate the picture . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ firm@@ ament Gau@@ ß is . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value of zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filters . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformer size . however , you want to create good results , especially if you select big values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the store and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters that you have set is stored for later and then can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the cutting , color , and intens@@ ities in the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and write images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by this caused un@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp m@@ asked must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the integrity filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the impossible mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters is often better at machining of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
&quot; the original un@@ clear color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens . &quot;
&quot; for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ness problems in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English below that address . &quot;
&quot; the regulator gl@@ ar sets the sharp@@ ness of the division of the division , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the colour ink allows a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set it here . &quot;
&quot; the tool error correction is one of the most developed tools , in order to remove un@@ desired art@@ e@@ facts with unprecedented speed . &quot;
the In@@ side algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains different pre@@ ferences , as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed description p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth glass place over the image . a value of 0,9 should be so that no sharp@@ ening is needed . please note that the details will always be re@@ arranged . &quot;
&quot; diagram depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly throughout all directions , while a value is close to 1 in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ zing or CCD noise , a high value of similar patterns will generate . JPEG arti@@ facts are best eliminated at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ es. p defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value as a degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned with larger structures . the higher this value is made , the more the geomet@@ ry is above , because it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : are often going through the algorithm often . usually 1 or 2 is enough .
&quot; &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : ang@@ ular integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen , it should also be small . be sure that small angles can generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral part distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length of pixel . you should set the value lower 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing , and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More quality which you receive by selecting this option is only low . but it doubles the run time . therefore we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as and loading do exactly this . every setting of image error can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; image error is compar@@ atively very fast in work . however , it can still last long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see how image errors can be removed with little arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease assets . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Peter H@@ ett@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ations from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ lics ; effects from sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sens@@ ations of digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in English in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
&quot; the screen picture above shows a typical scene , which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub @-@ window details and the Advanced Settings settings can remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time of filters per pixel and can be p@@ orted by the radius and the color in it becomes smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs adjusted . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter will change . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get longer and smoke or lubri@@ cation . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the frequency response can be removed or cat@@ ches can occur . put it at a value close to the max@@ im , if you want to remove a weak or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ant of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; gamma : controls the tolerance tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas , typically stronger than to increase . however , it also sharp@@ ened the shadow areas too . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping pressure . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear to appear , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter and is the recommended method . &quot;
&quot; store and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later charged . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with standard settings .
&quot; sometimes , a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , a little easier than an image is soft@@ ened and experim@@ enting with the menu entry with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ y soft@@ ening and experiment with the gl@@ ar . dialogue window shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ bility ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photographic data .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ ired art@@ e@@ facts about your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s cat@@ ches , film grains , compres@@ sive , compres@@ sive , compres@@ sive , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alised images that makes the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the text function is developed with another tool , the image error correction , developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ern and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression from JPEG is not perfect in some areas . in some areas it generates some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these issues .
&quot; the buttons save as and shop do exactly this . every attitude of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast in work . however , it can still last long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; below , you can reduce how a photo of DC @-@ shaped smoke is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ zing on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old color photo that has been used with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel to remove photos that were with a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality photos of high quality photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you have the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to a corrected picture . note that the wi@@ z@@ ard will notice the last night@@ picture and re@@ charge this automatically at the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the image in the image . the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are emphas@@ ized in all th@@ umb@@ nails .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ section : an average of neighbouring countries is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is used separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a batch of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block will be pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixel in block . &quot;
Kub@@ ic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a batch of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
&quot; below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ance correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ y , i.e. sub@@ str@@ ated corners , one image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lens , especially in the middle and large photo format , can &apos;t be evenly lit up the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ orous tra@@ des ; ( shaded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light in the sensor . tel@@ e@@ objects show below the circumstances . &quot;
&quot; but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center @-@ filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be used , even with Center @-@ Filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise impossible effects can be created through movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure @-@ areas of today &apos;s film and color@@ - or gray @-@ stu@@ enti@@ fe of digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter which is possible without this filter , the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter is applied to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the biggest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is designed to compens@@ ate a range of optical filters from 1 , or randomly to a light intensity of Vig@@ net@@ y , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; leuk@@ emia strength , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction is reduced the lumin@@ osity of the target image with these options . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to make a more sensitive new adjustment of the target picture , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is zero and use the Gra@@ dation of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ bility ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ scape correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ing in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a leuk@@ emia and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ bility ; lenti@@ l dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion . colour dist@@ ortion can not be corrected using this tool .
&quot; the coefficient of the second degree is the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or the conv@@ ex form of the image . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect effect , but fla@@ wed to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ effici@@ ative degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion can be corrected and positive values of kis@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the fourth degree . this value is stronger in the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners Param@@ eters of the Param@@ eters General . &quot;
&quot; zoom : this value scal@@ izes the image size , thereby carries a correction of first degree by negative values . negative values increase during positive the picture . &quot;
bright : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners during positive values them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of the dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used as standard values . &quot;
the tons or kis@@ sen@@ ular correction should be carried out prior to all the cutting or size changes . best perform this correction than all of the first . if you want to cut an image and after that a tonne @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the fal@@ cons .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool will display a vertical and horizontal aux@@ iliary line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to fix the kn@@ ell lines or a building wall in your image , and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in connection you can correct the lines with the help of lines . &quot;
&quot; if you can correct a ho@@ ver@@ ge dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will be black corners . you can transformation this with the cutting tool in the menu , remove from the image processing or on the zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most of the pictures , the tonne @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from front , frame and paintings are the perspective to correct the angle in picture 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction for a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulate infrared film of G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ a.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensor range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the range for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters for film gra@@ zing and film sensitivity if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ zing texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gra@@ zing and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; since the filters color channels are mi@@ red to produce infr@@ a @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information are missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ ming effect on a landscape picture of New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; filter film gra@@ vit@@ ation is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ zing on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer large silver @-@ grains of the photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere of your daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated for control of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more baskets , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the movie cell effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) that used the used film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers in order to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better for large pictures . smo@@ othing , the smo@@ other side or , viewed from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel size is 1 and Gl@@ orious 17 .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ant ; filter coal , uses color and intens@@ ities to create a carbon dioxide . the lines that determine the outline in drawing , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you would like to sk@@ etch out what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pin size , and the lower adjustment is the contrast ( gl@@ are ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ant ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a gray , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : divide the image in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by gl@@ ar blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you may break these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by the sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom In@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image along the circular lines that go out from a centre . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al separation : wi@@ ped the image by rotation of the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
&quot; distances : get the picture to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused cam@@ al@@ in@@ se . the object seems to be back in the background . &quot;
&quot; movement sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image by horizontal movement of pixel . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ening Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and brilliant focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle light bulb . &quot;
cont@@ actor : wi@@ ped the picture by random shift of the pixel and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the colour pool in the image and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves on your image . this gives it natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
drop size allows the size of the drops to change . because the size of the image is not set automatically with the size of the image . number changes the size and density of drops . fish au@@ sts changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
&quot; you can stick with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; image editing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the range of tools to choose the area , e.g. a face to stay free . if you then start the filter shelves will remain free from shelves . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ause Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and that worked image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values have been used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu trans@@ forming or trans@@ forming sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot;
photo @-@ blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to increase a photo by a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to shr@@ inking is simple . the big question is , how can you obtain a picture of bub@@ bles and details ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here , makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size is used to change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain the aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio is the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned with larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading are used precisely . each insert for photo can be stored as text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; photo @-@ blowing is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after moving . you can break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo v@@ ases by using a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the result ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
&quot; the cutting of a photos is not just a common operation , but also a common tool to summar@@ ize a picture . the image processing is easy to cut with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle with the mouse , then you will see this rectangle with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you leave the mouse button , the field of the photos will be cut off . this allows you to change a good overview of your photo by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save or save in the menu file to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the fore@@ sight area , you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you can use centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , there are two buttons to handle the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to cut the size possible , depending on chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio has to cut its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or vertically ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original picture . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the help network enable help to push your images better , so that you may have your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third par@@ agus , harmon@@ ic triangles have a possibility to share a rectangle in similar triangles . &quot;
golden @-@ center : the golden center is a split which is based on various natural growth pattern such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus mus@@ sel or the flo@@ ats of a sunflower seeds . it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful .
&quot; the golden partition is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the old Egyptians and the Greeks who were using your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times if you have your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is headed by Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two ahead . &quot;
the golden @-@ center provides liquid aid lines when you have a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; golden spiral is getting closer to your target good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ thirds , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that runs along the line of the spiral along the line of spiral and creates a symm@@ etri@@ cal visual river . &quot;
&quot; a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of golden spiral , also called golden tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles is used to produce the golden spiral . that can be one line or different objects . this can be just as being without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; golden triangles also gli@@ des themselves from the above discussed golden spiral . its failure is the middle points of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equivalent triangles . diagonal to this lines may be a static object of dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you are using golden triangles in order to break your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently . &quot;
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious particles .
&quot; using the button color , you can set the color of the aux@@ iliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this way you can adapt the color of your current image . &quot;
&quot; the free rotation is a tool , to turn a picture to any angle . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easy to fix the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things around an angle are fil@@ ming . you can fix this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; image editing and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your picture with the sliding angle . the values on this sli@@ ps are set in degrees . you can set the sliding door to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right above .
&quot; for your help , the free rotation is a horizontal and vertical line available . move the mouse poin@@ ter to positioning the two lines . after you fix it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot an image , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is the function transformer cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . please note , however , the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ al transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ charged automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective , the image becomes somewhat tigh@@ tened . for individual adaptation is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have the perspective , you get unbe@@ ar@@ able tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to transfer this is the image with trans@@ forming the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool used is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the picture in one direction and the other part into the opposite . this is not rotating , the picture is dist@@ orted to the upper part of the picture . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can boot this module via trans@@ forming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; sciss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can adjust horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you push on pre@@ ferences , the angle are shown to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed right . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line finishes . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left button to fix the lines to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the coating , the image becomes a bit wi@@ ped . for a single loop , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two dra@@ fts have to be avoided and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after switching the image , the image has tri@@ ang@@ ular tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the image with trans@@ forming the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , such as these libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; due to these dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ate ; displays only files in formats . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file expansion and di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ants ; please refer to the configuration . in the configuration you can find further information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to use this format to use . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ mer Converter of &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ v . in the configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ bility ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ p ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; di@@ gi@@ p . here , more than 200 Roh@@ file formats can be seen . here , the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are frequently stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . if you don &apos;t understand a film @-@ processing program and is therefore not a film @-@ processing software to display or edit movies . the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies use the program to play back .

&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , turn@@ tables , noise supp@@ ression , in@@ focus , in@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the pre@@ conception . these modes are :
&quot; vertically , without dup@@ lic@@ at . the top section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected th@@ umb@@ nail area . &quot;
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower indicates the filter applied to the area below the selected th@@ umb@@ nail area . &quot;
&quot; the top section shows the original , and the right to comparison the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; horizontal parts , the upper range shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter . &quot;
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the pre@@ conception and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and lower exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general installation site .
( 3 ) : the frame is a preview of preview . you can pull this frame with the mouse within the picture and turn on the part of the image that you want to see the preview part of the dialog appears immediately .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the left corner , there is a help and the possibility to reset any buttons on your default values . all entries from the last use of the module will be noticed . &quot;
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider represents an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature range . you can drag and move it into a square . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker &apos;s button to draw a square . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this will naturally advance your images of ge@@ o data .

&quot; graph@@ s and graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ene . the programs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program to replace .
&quot; graph@@ s and graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ene ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions : &quot;
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph is re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open or graph@@ s in &amp; box ; in one &amp; Kate ; -@@ component
un@@ loading large graph ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than this no@@ des )
&quot; another required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program , which is the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s . it is needed in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in its own window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; box , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list last updated files . Click on the first icon to preview the dialog file . &quot;
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; the main window looks like in the bottom screen photo :
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the file changed in &amp; box , loaded file changed from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose if the graph will be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change , your choice can also be noted , so later you can change your decision later , you can set up your choice on settings ; set up ... see also here . &quot;
&quot; when you can open a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance open , eg ; in file Browser or at the command line , you will have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to be displayed in a window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this will also change with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can re @-@ open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice either as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the graph will be split up to multiple sites , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected . &quot;
&quot; if you use several sites , you can choose if the parts of the graph , which will be applied to one page , will be ignored in this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;

&quot; the site again store the option to determine if a file has changed on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can design@@ ate a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charging or changes the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page opens the option to determine the behaviour of &amp; graphic viewers ; set up , if a graph will open outside a current session ( see graph@@ s in a new window or in a window of the already current session ) or determine that each time is being asked . &quot;
&quot; the site seat management gives the opportunity to determine the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; determine . you can open a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) , or determine if needed . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appear on a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorith@@ ms . the entries as they are described in the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for geri@@ at@@ ric graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or str@@ ati@@ fied represent@@ ations of detailed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays down the edges into the same direction ( from top left or left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as a few edge over@@ laps . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it is produced represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ int model . this is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i Algorith@@ m , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional scale . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ ad@@ ata &apos;s met@@ ad@@ ata . the geographical data is stored in an external browser in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools available by pictures geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itud@@ inal points are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format and you can download the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of selected images using a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window , and call the menu . to download a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to upload a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains natural data that were recorded at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded at GMT time and therefore must be performed at GMT time . this can be carried out with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the default setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera space . if the deviation is below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related all the pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can use this limits and push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialogue . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next time , you have to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map and to be found . select the relevant region and increase it once again . the map can always be changed manually . the map can always be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module you can connect the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages compliant to version 4.@@ 01 . you can specify the albums that will be exported as HTML pages . the character set is encoded with UTF @-@ 8 , to make a best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings , select all the albums . they will not only select hier@@ arch@@ ically . these albums will not only select hier@@ arch@@ ically . you will soon be able to select a large number of albums . in the area below will display the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text which will appear in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the driver image defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely explained by itself . if you click on a picture , a new page will also be displayed on a picture . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer , eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated pictures . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have chosen the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size is naturally also explained . &quot;
&quot; the rider th@@ umb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the record riders from the album riders for the th@@ umb@@ nails , that are small pictures displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . press off the process to break down the process .
&quot; when the module creates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can set the program message to determine if error during production . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to display the preview of the gallery . press off to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL bas@@ ing tool to view images .

&quot; first you have to choose the images that are packed in MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there , you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning the file on TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image process is specified . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast to a very smooth change . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set next . in doubt , you should make them black . the name and the path of created file can set you under name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the film . after all settings are adapted to your wishes , you can quickly drink a coffee or drink a coffee in all the rest of your computer , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , so you can adapt the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right bottom . &quot;
&quot; the printer assistant allows several pictures to print on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . for example , the combined images can also be automatically print@@ out with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : sensible to print or print using the Gim@@ p module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your in RA@@ W format stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : do you not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button you can see the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re@@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white can be used . if the result is not optim@@ ally , you can process the picture later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not work effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview content , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG use a loss @-@ stick algorithm and produces the smallest file size . &quot;
&quot; the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to edit your pictures often or later , you should not use the JPEG format , since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata that are contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to break down this process , you can stop using this process . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode for sure , for example by testing on a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for single pictures . however , you have the ability to re@@ write the option automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp to be used . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the program from Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image to size or enlarge , with four types of the image change are provided : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; processing preparation : prepar@@ es the picture for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing solution and size of the phot@@ op@@ iers . the target picture , inclusive background size , Rand@@ om size and background colour is adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images in advance . more images can draw on the list of sen@@ ate pictures and lay there . &quot;
&quot; after you started the module , the images window with the selected images will be displayed . you can add more images with one file extensions dialog . for the last selected image , you can see a preview of the right page . &quot;
you can also draw pictures on the pictures list and add it to the list of images that can add to sen@@ ate pictures .
&quot; with the button pictures , select the selected images from the list of sen@@ ate images . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message with the OK window of your e @-@ mail clients . you have to add here only the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the emails . there may be a good idea to send many mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change settings for the sending of the images . your configuration is stored and used to change it every time .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; following the selection of comments in an attached file , comments are attached to the images into a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format below the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it should be adapted to P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG image format , select the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data are added to the sen@@ ate pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically , in search of errors , you can view . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . you can download this window with the button . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have displayed your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can select here between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions option is activated in the presentation , and you need to have an appropriate graphics card using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card because otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images are displayed in the left corner , during the presentation . &quot;
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can manually break down with Es@@ c .
&quot; the option images randomly select that the pictures will be displayed in a random order , so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; under delay between the pictures , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effects . so you should test it before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . randomly elec@@ ts a different effect between the pictures .
&quot; during Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and restart the presentation and stop the next picture and stop the slide . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently not currently not documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the current selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menus , as background for your K@@ DE employer . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with a photo album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , therefore in people , places and in group keywords are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have given your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current appearance . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the brows@@ ers changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons are shown . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images from a few thousand pictures to a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the pictures of your action area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol before its name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a separate pre@@ conception , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see also the image . &quot;
&quot; to show pictures next to the name , select the button , which you need to turn right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can specify the view for each category separately . it has the advantage that you can specify symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable pictures ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must specify which image for each individual person will be displayed . in order to see this , you &apos;ll need to display the image window frames ( in closer ) . now you can adjust the image for the appropriate person . in the c@@ auti@@ ous window , you can adjust the image factor after your desires and to select which part of the image will be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for searching the entry in the main window , there will be a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for fixed picture properties . this dialog can be seen on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; when you enter a string in the field of labelling or description , the labelling and descriptions of the pictures are searched after this text . if you want , you may also be a date of the total file , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures after certain names , as you can see in the picture . here becomes pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user guide for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and look at the fast @-@ up , screen photos and entry videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; Win a photo album ; and select the demo album in the first dialog ; and select the menu entry for the first time , or select from the menu Help menu . subsequently , some sample images are uploaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a associated HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this glue you can see here : . as the name suggests , this surro@@ unds you show data about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each Lei@@ ste shows another unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the image you can see a part of a database by setting up only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used on the following ways : you can select the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will always display the first picture of this date in preview picture ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in preview . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by selecting the mouse button and select the mouse over the Lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline , so you will select your selection in preview only pictures of this period . you can cut the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; with two options available to create HTML @-@ websites with your pictures , the one is integrated in &amp; a photo album ; in the following part of the user &apos;s book , the one is described in &amp; a photo album ; integrated version you can create via the HTML menu . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each field is described . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the over@@ looks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example , you see an example of this settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; -@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the review site . nour@@ ishing information about export files will be found in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information from a party is obvious . for example , you can not use any pictures of a party . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewing . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can design@@ ate how the HTML pages should look like . most of the possibilities are clear , why not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; below on the page you can set different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures download the resolution of a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewing will change the resolution at any time you can change . it can therefore change your pictures with a lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as well . if he want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting field , place the different folders and URL , where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best choose for all your HTML files , select a base folder and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are stored . this file is stored and set automatically for the next time . this file , you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really are all visible for viewing . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser is started . the URL , which you specify , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files are not yet in the final destination folder you have to manually copy them manually . thus , the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all the sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the right described options described above are all three based on basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder was created , whose name set you in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , you may want to create your pictures with this . you can of course create an HTML page for viewing the images , then you &apos;ll have to add a look at the pictures , entrance place , etc . then you must not even do this work . &quot;
you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import other files into your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the pictures are stored in the file , or whether in the file is only a link to pictures , that you may have all the pictures together , and this file can be so independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can exp@@ orting a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that have shown in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is obviously only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialog for Export images are described , which allows you to export via the File Format . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether to act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
&quot; at the manual Manu@@ ally close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option automatic in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy and photo album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file himself is very small it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to compressed this files you simply select the export file option .
&quot; the last option of this page is lim@@ iting . if you send your friends pictures , you would like to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can tell the size that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im out of the web browser or from the File File , select &amp; box @-@ Album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to select what pictures you would like to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are looking for the category persons of the file of imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialogue window , which will be imported in the third dialogue window , which will be present in your database in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can pay the categories of the ad@@ orable file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the image . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse images and see : if you see pictures , you &apos;ll often see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you would like to see all pictures where this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will get the different steps of ( 1 ) fixed information on your pictures , via ( 2 ) to search the passage and look at ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization possibilities . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your paintings . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual , this manual will also take videos with one . &quot;
&quot; all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml saves all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. nor@@ mals or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want to secure . &quot;
&quot; download the folder where your pictures are stored and used this at future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start a different folder with pictures , you can see &amp; p@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; over the menu entry settings ( photo album ) , set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; to@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of user @-@ hand services are explained to you the various setup possibilities . &quot;
&quot; left , you will see six different symbols , with which you can call a preview of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting it stands for a detailed help you can call through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also describe your own groups such as objects , places , and tags for each image , e.g. individuals , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a certificate and symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories are already mentioned . in the dialogue options you can set up complete members of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group than in a group than in a group . &quot;
&quot; you can see the setting options available to you . with the selected list of members , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; includes his modular system with other graphics applications , such as di@@ gi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image plug @-@ in interface . further information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; modules can be accessed via the modules . modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help site that you can access through the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules used by several applications can be used together , it may be that the modules have always been tested with the demo database . therefore , you should always test new modules from the command line with the command &gt; -@@ photo album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I would not have been warned ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album will not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums , this kind of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so you can use the functions with &amp; their photo album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulates &amp; photo album ; the current album , which is simply the actual view , so all images that shows you the image preview . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s your photo album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example every person , then every entry of this category are an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have defined in the installation dialog as a category of virtual albums , i.e. , for example , use the category persons , so do you have chosen people to view and continue the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . start the installation dialog and select in the modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see an example of a starting screen , as soon as you see &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see above a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the tool@@ bar you &apos;ll see no information about your pictures . at the moment we will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will not only click on the entry images which shows you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any image with notes on the image , where the image has been taken at the same time , and you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures of particular comments at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pictured and all the pictures in Copenhagen were included . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browser , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by clicking on persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as you are always using information on your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on re@@ loc@@ ating the pictures within the list : if you have shown a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can find that the used names are moved to the top to find the people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabetical list , click on the icon for sorting on date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen notes for each image individually , you may need to edit any selected images and edit these images with notes . Click this case simply on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture right . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu option added to once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window that displays the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can also add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also take one entry into a category and take it out to sort this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is predi@@ cting that you are searching for your categories in alphabetical order . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the help dialog@@ s by clicking on the frame , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by moving him out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also see a frame completely out . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and then click the button . this process can be seen in the image . &quot;
&quot; select the entry images in your browser , you will receive an overview of showing images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter here . you can configure the size of th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture viewer . if you still have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you want to delete and express either the removal key or select in menu Edit . now , the window will be displayed you can see in the image . &quot;
&quot; you can have a solution for this problem . you can also use a solution to you . you can also use images anywhere , so you &apos;ll need to record pictures anywhere , so you &apos;ll have to record the pictures anywhere , so you can see the pictures from your hard disk . in the picture you can see the pictures from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , these images are present , such as a photo album ; you can also view these images with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see this feature , you need to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you want to avoid the installation of the relevant CD , please purchase a bigger hard disk to save all photos on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you can read the pictures that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click on the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also choose all pictures that you can view your little Sister and choose the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; thus , you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the F@@ everything . if you have set your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing all pictures you want to be hidden . if you want the pictures to be displayed again , click Sper@@ m . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to determine a password which must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set this password , select password change in privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for one can find all the images on the hard drive and to the other , anyone can read the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete this kind of password protection , not very familiar to defend the view on private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage , and hours about hours to describe it is of course you want it at some point . for this reason , you &apos;ll have a photo _ and video viewer . this is why you can see from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; looking at the viewer you can see in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is done on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the Info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want , you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed following a right click on the viewer . then , the menu menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here to click here . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by clicking the buttons image high and the image below . you can easily reach the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as di@@ asch@@ au . downloads a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new picture can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or Min@@ us . it will be stopped and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful ability of viewing of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to change in full @-@ screen mode .
&quot; if you use the viewer in the image and zo@@ oming in the image , you can easily pull down a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button , you can re @-@ zoom the Plus button and shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the rec@@ tal , the zo@@ oms puts the zo@@ oms so that every pixel is on the screen a pixel image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that are coming in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ st@@ aste .
&quot; with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this is not working with videos . you can do comments on the current image with the menu menu from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you consider images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog of the image to mark this name . but maybe it may move to mark the image and see more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures , and watch it as good or bad , while you see one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view pictures with tra@@ its while you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can watch a feature by pressing the corresponding character . in see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , these are available in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be shown in the preview view . if you have shown categories in D@@ re Pre@@ view view , you can simply add features to the pictures by pressing the letter for the feature , after the picture was chosen . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will be allowed to paint and paint on the picture .
&quot; the painting is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can do your previous year later . &quot;
&quot; in case you can see a picture painted on the painted picture . in order to switch the painting by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; please click on the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; you have to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties , and the object displayed in the wi@@ el@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already chosen with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert and click on the symbol in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu entry in menu entry . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following hing@@ ed menu is built , so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed features , click on user to take these changes . if you have entered invali@@ d values , a message with error message will be displayed . then , you can read the input error and re @-@ throw the changes with shut@@ down . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you process a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of your self @-@ economic view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the self @-@ economic view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . when you want to ren@@ dering the whole texture , even if you want to ren@@ dering a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
screen photo shows the control points of camera . you can drag these control points to the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire @-@ view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation than even the position for shifts . you can change the shift through the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a screen model a visible level . you can specify this value relatively to the visible object of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or the visible level of the scene , or equal to the scene of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object properties will be displayed on the left and the four graphic views right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like to order the standard shut@@ ters or if you need a different arrangement , you can store them up . you can also store multiple shut@@ ters and easily change between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; in order to create a window over or under a view , pull the facade to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the facade to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views of each other , draw the facade in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views to the cart@@ el card above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible shut@@ ters are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view out of the anch@@ oring , pull the facade onto the desktop or click on the small left @-@ pointing arrow in the facade bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are woven , you can easily fix them at any point . &quot;
&quot; the current window view , you can store with view window . it will display a dialog , in which you can store the shut@@ ters under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering this program has to be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view . &quot;
&quot; a slide mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . if you want to insert the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can submit a quick preview of up to full quality in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , in the tool@@ bar or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender Mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the box section and give the image cut to ren@@ dering the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination of quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this is used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection @-@ lighting . a detailed description of the r@@ ender features will be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is coated with only a beam per pixel , different errors can be created . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or Stu@@ ff effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of these defects . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is becoming increasingly divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel can depend on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam per pixel . if you set the difference between the values to the neighbouring pixel , both pixels will be charged with the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ types which can be followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn out j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
&quot; on this cardboard map , you can set if the alpha @-@ channels will be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent if the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console issue . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and choose a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers are currently supported ; not yet the complete command line of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if import@@ ing trou@@ bles@@ hooting or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source text file in the Editor Editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it into the object @-@ tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also add .
&quot; the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ sk@@ er , which is a scene . usually , this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place here the path to your document ten@@ tion and the version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( e.g. al@@ tim@@ ers ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files , you must also enter the path to these files here . when a file is used in different paths , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the view of view in the camera view and in the window type features .
&quot; you can set the object catch of points to the grid menu in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and shooting . &quot;
&quot; larger values provide a more accurate wire model and thus a better approach for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the High details faithful to extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided when the camera uses a extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . this property makes a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is placed behind the objects . the wall is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you check the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you check out cant@@ een , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ le@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling may be adjusted . detailed information on parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing shut@@ ters or create new window orders . in the section window orders , you can create and save shut@@ ters . &quot;
the combination field standard window arrangement : shows all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window line at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of shut@@ ters shows all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement , you can create with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot;
any window line is identified by the name . the name must be un@@ clear and must not be empty .
&quot; the list below the name shows all views of the chosen shut@@ ters . new views , you can create with the button and delete selected views with the button . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ folded , you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and blocking the view in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; installed and now , you would like to follow without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can use all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate simple scene very popular : a ball on one plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings before you complain that you can only use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied , as a result you receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t add light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have faul@@ t@@ less installed , you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; the following pre @-@ installed window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and existing symbols of tool@@ bars . read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate presentation of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll have to use these menus and symbols now frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then choose the menu entry . thus , you have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view from the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you can find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera , this is later guidance , but note that you can change the camera in the view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button to press or press the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the lenses can immediately change this settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene . you might add a qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an independent method for the solution of this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in object @-@ tree , change the name and press the button . in the object @-@ tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ model view now shows the plane , even though at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you &apos;ll notice that you can view the item for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case , you will find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move to the bottom to exercise a unit to the horizontal line , only allow you to know some of these parameters . select loop and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to set out its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose something out in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog can be found in which you can select how the item is being inserted . please choose the name in the object @-@ tree ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button you see how the pig@@ ment now looks like . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a big black material because you can still need to enter the appearance of materials at any time with a click . also , there are many possibilities now , but do now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see color in a preview of color and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is correct now . if you ren@@ dering your image with one click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color scheme . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then choose this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the box @-@ board list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree every time , select the colors in view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already run this step , as you can already run the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; you can already understand the ball as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : in 1 ( do not forget the ball down or press button ) , so the ball would be floating on the floor , as you moved the ground to a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now gives a strange result : as already before , the glob@@ ular surface is like a painted black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now refer to a material . as already with the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; choose first object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . Click on the ball pig@@ ment , then choose entries and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take time to set some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on application or press the input button .
&quot; the settings the shine effect and reflection is already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of which possibilities you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; offer . hopefully you have learned as much as you can create simple , but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you get a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ps , the Ren@@ derer @-@ hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ches scenes ) through any pixels in the scene and how atmospheric effects can operate in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed for pixel . thus , the scene is processed for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source , you don &apos;t need any scene , the image is simple , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual File dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; created &quot;
&quot; always if you can open a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list . &quot;
&quot; saved the model already saved , it is stored under the same name . if there is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry only if you don &apos;t have saved changes in the scene .
&quot; to repeat the recently decl@@ ining command . this menu entry , you can only select when you use case . &quot;
stores the current shut@@ ters and opens a dialogue in which you can enter a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the appearance , the keyboard and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialogue to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add a dialog box for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ sk@@ er ; -@@ commands or add new commands .
opens a dialogue to establish the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ ers ; add commands and remove .
&quot; a b@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to make rough surfaces , without changing either B@@ eu@@ le on the surface individually and to change the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms which can use as a building block : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed further to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis using an image file as a colour card .
this is a comfortable picture @-@ looking and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select pictures to the display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball @-@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key Return .
&quot; you can adjust if any image is displayed in a window , whether all images are always to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first characters in the browser window . then , a small input field appears in the right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; set up &amp; ball @-@ show in the dialog box ; there are five boxes cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work mode of &amp; ball @-@ show . in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the keyboard hints for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if this image is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background colour that you can continue to set up below . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , invites &amp; ball @-@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ball @-@ show ; when searching the name of the last opened folders . next start &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; Click on the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , window is larger than the image , is also filled here with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ball @-@ show , set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be extended to the full screen . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between image changes with a slide show . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the sli@@ p@@ eg@@ ler or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is cancelled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the key focal point for the various operating modes of &amp; spher@@ es ; in the cart@@ el cards for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays big symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short representation .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short representation .
showing images for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short representation .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor is based on the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ball show ; also closed if no browser window is open .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;

&quot; press photo ; try to give you a lot of control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; show photo ; to select on this settings , you have to change in eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color , which is displayed if the sub@@ - or over@@ load capacities were selected , the colors should display with what you should show , in contrast . bottom exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure of a dark colour . &quot;

&quot; &amp; In@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application for scanning images , which doesn &apos;t make more than images to scan and save images . can store a dialog for storing or save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures from the store . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the soft project page by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / C@@ GI @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command @-@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog is opened to choose the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and OK to open the scanner . stop the scanner ; finish .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not particularly treated .
&quot; to convert a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ ach@@ ting and then scan the final scan for the final scan . the advance can be started by a preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom in the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom , that the complete preview of the window fits . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; if you are able to view a preview in the settings , then the image is shown in a window window , as below is displayed , then the image is stored and shr@@ ink@@ age ? en leads to a break and you get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the same named dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of user is not requested , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores the dialog for each image , open the dialog before each one @-@ sc@@ anned image . if &amp; Red@@ l@@ ite , you will automatically be able to query this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored at the option save without a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder will be used as a standard for the saving dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialogue to save . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical view@@ ix of each time , if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . if the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
&quot; the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; output ; -@@ manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; In@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used , to end &amp; output . &quot;

you may be able to set up existing multimedia buttons so that they operate as &amp; amar@@ ok ; allows you to operate your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly available in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list , and look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command scene options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; additionally Amar@@ ok still has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give users a feedback if the script will not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use dialog , so the user account , why a script is not running . &quot;
term &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; wei@@ r@@ end@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder scripts / Tem@@ plates you will find a lot of presentation scripts in many different languages . you can easily determine them as the basis for your own scripts or simply to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
using D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each K@@ DE installation should lie .
&quot; most of the scripts themselves allow external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be used relatively simple . here &apos;s an example in py@@ thon : &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts will continuously monitor their default input and respond to events . of course , a script may also ignore the events if there is no use for this . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to show the setup dialog . to store the store and loading of the setup data each script will take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will put the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ down sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script now could ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value of 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu ( sub@@ menu ) Con@@ tains the path to selected files of play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be specified . to remove one user @-@ defined menu entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script called d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script , e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ; terminated , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal should be processed to do for example , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ ok script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are essentially normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) which can also be seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can be seen clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the expanded amar@@ script script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is finished , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wik@@ i scripts page by &amp; amar@@ ok ; apply for your entry on K@@ DE apps you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can easily pull music into the play@@ list instead of using endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok , you will find the play within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list is still the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Rivers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio @-@ systems can be used , such as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; normally , you have to enter the Fol@@ lowing file of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok sources : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker uses you should have no difficulty . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; how most applications are able to enable or dis@@ able to enable the compilation @-@ time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ ile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; without effort to set up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to play@@ list , or if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window rests ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
m@@ oods barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok is compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental feature of the m@@ oods barrier .
&quot; design full : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ o has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thereby , it will be changed for m@@ ood@@ bar . &quot;
tuning files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; supported with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files in the settings file of &amp; amar@@ ok will be stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ o / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external brows@@ ers : lets you choose which browser of &amp; amar@@ ok will be started when a browser needs to be needed .
&quot; other brows@@ ers use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; play@@ list when saving , save the current play@@ list automatically when selecting &amp; amar@@ ok automatically , if you want to lose the current play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory location of the play@@ list , otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up the current piece in the unit , make sure the play@@ lists window open / shut up , in order to keep the running part always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; in turn changes to context @-@ brows@@ ers , the context @-@ browser shows how the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the appearance of the appearance , you can adjust &amp; amar@@ o ; appearance . the section is part in three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can adjust the use of different scripts in &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise , you can choose scripts in the following section : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press on select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme yourself , you own a choice of choice and can set up a separate color scheme . for this , use them activated color chosen for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; play at the start , &amp; amar@@ ok ; following the program start , play the play automatically at the point , with which she was stopped after the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to connect the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . Click to select from the dialog select the desired font to the O@@ SD . the check box shadow ensures that the text in the O@@ SD is depicted .
&quot; using your own colors , you can use the option to adapt the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . if desired colors are not activated , the pre @-@ mounted &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display is displayed in the O@@ SD text . through the input of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . you can design@@ ate the O@@ SD on which screen will appear to appear on a multi @-@ way monitor .
&quot; select audio driver from the selection field , select a audio driver from the select box . some drivers are able to activate additional adjust@@ ing options in this cardboard card . &quot;
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the file , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to refer to music files . in order to include a file into the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes inc@@ entive fields , as with the selected folders . &quot;
as well as well : this causes &amp; amar@@ o ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folders .
&quot; monitor : allows &amp; amar@@ o ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. , music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search can be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import@@ ing that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections ( .@@ pl@@ s- und .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection later in the play@@ list .
&quot; the part of collecting database is used for select a database for the collection . the combination box driver is required . if MySQL is selected , there is another facility in the sub @-@ window fitting . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL facility is used to set the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; under the calcul@@ ator : the calcul@@ ator is entered , where the database is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name , which the connection is established . &quot;
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data required for the database connection to the database .
the cart@@ on last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m a . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces on a loaded .@@ f@@ m server and create music @-@ recommendations regarding the current unit .
here you type your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
&quot; send out the profile and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok , to transmit the names of the mir@@ ro@@ red pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar inter@@ pret@@ ations : after activ@@ ating this setting is called &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar inter@@ pret@@ ations in each piece can be accessed . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
&quot; am@@ aro@@ K only requires the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including that contained programs , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of it , for example modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide how to handle k@@ deli@@ bs minimum . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD will advance that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , so we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably you will find an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library to days . you can see this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org , and you can also delete the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection . &quot;
&quot; mostly , this is that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file system crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok is a bit mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok will be compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . in case e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to the editing of met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring down@@ fall and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but they do not define as Unicode characters . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error by writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ; &quot;
&quot; this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can fix the status display under visual symbols . please note that in some cases up to three times you can click on a icon until this setting shows its effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : invisible symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map . please check the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ant Q@@ t @-@ version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most inst@@ ances clari@@ fy themselves on the easiest by the help of a experts Your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter a bug there if something is on an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list . how do music get in there ?
&quot; that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then , drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ window in the statistic window was transformed into the Statistics window . you will find it in ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by users , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; in order to evaluate pieces , the review list must be shown in the play@@ list and select column . Click here to select the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; choose the files you want to remove , and press it on your keyboard . or simply click on your keyboard . or select from the right mouse button to select from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list , and let them fall there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ box of the play@@ list , directly next to the adding button , you can save the play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel program and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look even to lib@@ visual and this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
the Equali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . also you can find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras Equali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end @-@ independent approach , hence the actual question : what media types does G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . like you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG formats ! &quot;
&quot; it may be ! maybe you can use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default , no MP3 dec@@ or can be supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ law reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input &quot;
restart the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink driver , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( eg . S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( eg . the software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you searching for the problem of problem and solution . for g@@ amer , you may need another sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; the doing &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget the media must be de@@ coded for most people . g@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can deliver directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the g@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning ; see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause bo@@ xed reproduction . read this error report . enlarge the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA alignment file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to receive the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimised for analysis ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less orders will react , please help us to remedy him . &quot;
&quot; g@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the g@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . carry out the register to register all G@@ stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the FAQ FAQ . if that &apos;s not helping you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stra@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Store you download m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then run the module folder by G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with gh @-@ config / g@@ stra@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now run &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;

how to know the current in &amp; amar@@ o ; current title if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you inter@@ pre@@ t and title of running quantities : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use name amar@@ ok player technology &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and Ihr@@ us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA file .
visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations can be separated from &amp; amar@@ ok ; press windows . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changeable window .

&quot; basically this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played , the less influence has a single assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can apply the rating for a piece self by clicking with the right button in the play@@ lists window . here you mark evaluation . then , you can select the evaluation of a piece in the play@@ lists and edit : evaluation or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation as met@@ ad@@ ata in the met@@ ad@@ ata dialog . &quot;

&quot; includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then break between saving and changes . moreover , you can also break down and open the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , will ask for any stored project , which should be done so as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project will be asked what should happen , as if you had called the file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select via the released dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog for the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . burning dialog can only open , if the project has already been data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here , you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is this ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you &apos;re using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you have not used files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you to see the files already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is set up &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the media , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opening the CD @-@ copy dialog . this also allows the copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD instead of normal copy . you should also want to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows the copy of a DVD to a different medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the help of copying dialog . also , the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
&quot; opening the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the contents completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between the writing modes and input . &quot;
&quot; the dialog can be burnt after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can immediately be burned down by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
bur@@ ns a previously created DVD image . the dialogue asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source that can immediately be burned by pressing the burning button .
&quot; a previously compiled DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window will typically be used according to the reading of a DVD in the content view , but can also be used above . it contains information about the read video , Ko@@ di@@ er@@ settings and even possibilities to change the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; shows information about the specified medium . this information are presented in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed is the tool@@ bar currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is crossed , a small body at the bottom edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not exagger@@ ated , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switches the folder view or look . the folder view is activated a summary of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content of the content is activated , whose content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media information , lock and un@@ lock of the drive or dis@@ card of the media . &quot;
&quot; the ingredients look for one or off . the content of the content allows the select and pulling files into the project view . the content of the content is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was chosen with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view . &quot;
&quot; switches the copy in the project view or off . the copy is a nar@@ ro@@ west field , which is only visible if the projection screen has no real function , it looks very pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the key arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adapt the key scheme for it further below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b , setup assist@@ ants . so you can set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administ@@ rators will need to enter the password for the system manager ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programming settings will be carried out . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alise and to determine the program . &quot;
&quot; as many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ applications also , using a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ Interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell@@ ac . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be used either , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function scope , therefore rather your taste and the type of task is crucial , which of the included programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command scene program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions need to make sure you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . then , enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; audio CD ; it is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; K@@ DE ; with him , you can easily be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed using &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many Ko@@ di@@ ers , which are installed in WAV files ( loss @-@ free compression ) . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , this WAV files ( usually one per title ) will be compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as low @-@ loss F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ until ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers are already present , but it is very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile anything . however , it is not necessary to be used only if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; which co@@ di@@ ers / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ ding Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction about co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ded ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio CD ; this program is not possible to handle any copying protection . if not the mechanisms of copying protection is not possible . avoid the purchase of head @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup only has to be made only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained to the daily use of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the hard disk approach to the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the start . &quot;
&quot; can convert many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything will be detected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of main character . on the page , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of CD data will be launches according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case you must first be connected to the internet . ) &quot;
&quot; to start reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the tab , the encoding was configured . &quot;
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so the option can be read with another encoder as the default . it is to be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a previously selected file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and add . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finish ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main arrangement dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different cart@@ on cards ( such as Encoder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . this way you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates , and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; using audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a light advantage versus MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , &apos; lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high quality ( high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present .
&quot; MP3 - when music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - in the beginning of 2009 , these devices only support the MP3 format . &quot;
&quot; a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) : &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the unit . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR together stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of teenagers , portable devices and car stere@@ o@@ gens . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or replaced by the free@@ DB file via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ Program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt is lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ed ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ ded ; parameters that can be used ( = button number in the wi@@ z@@ ard ) :
&quot; that is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can read the information you can go up / enter , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is to note that here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the author ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist can be added to the music company damage . all information can be obtained through a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; if enabled , select a check@@ box address ( sending an address ) . for the use of Free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address as the server is not used in the system ( this can only know the programmer that has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; used by Free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographic is set to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of Refle@@ servers for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually generated monthly ) only updates the database . &quot;
what extension program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there &apos;s rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precise , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for the reading of audio CD ; see note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this is not done . &quot;
&quot; for storing the read @-@ read WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ ers and the desired file format are chosen . during the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression of audio data ) can be added to the setup of the Ko@@ di@@ ers . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined Ko@@ di@@ erer . further information about co@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter of the Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installation of a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information on its switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reader of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ proof audio CD ; check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this tips may give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uncertain what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all set up and our first &amp; CD ; read &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files whatever you can do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have a write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside ) .
&quot; the first section is treated by the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ed ; , something which is probably only done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for any read &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; here , we determine the code for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program using Free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; even though we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with each read of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device code is given to the selected program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map of general settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is checked and entered , as shown in screen photo . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for incomplete information , so you will be noti@@ fied if data are missing from the key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the cart@@ on CD ; Settings menu . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; automatically download data via the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the Internet to access the Free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you &apos;re not satisfied with the database entry and the file name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag names , they can easily changed with the database entry and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , then dis@@ able the selection fields and Free@@ DB is not used . you can use Free@@ DB locally available in Off@@ line mode . however , this is more than 620 MB , the two select fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode will be set up on the following board card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data on request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server via the internet . how does the system , which data will be released ? read the section via Free@@ DB . put everything as shown in screen photo . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with remote database on the Internet Server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this path the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both do not work as well as the server , as many fire@@ walls can drill the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there might be more happiness with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf in the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folders / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know how easy to try . &quot;
CD ; throw at the end of the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you can check this , then the path / folders can be specified in which the WAV files can be stored . this file cannot be selected if you do not want to make files in a private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; to enter everything , as it is on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , in circumstances something has to be bled upon the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned before , it is adequate for a very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . it is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &quot; tags can also be deleted at demand . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) . &quot;
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : when a dual @-@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than a WAV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of an &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; described in this section , how the process of the reader is described . we will create MP3 files . the file structure , the type like the music is organized on the hard drive , as we are comfortable and the CD ; data from Free@@ DB is described , must be repeated for any read &amp; CD ; this section must be repeated in this section . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; the screen photos are not included in Free@@ DB , the screen photos will look somewhat different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully completed by Free@@ DB . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data can be reset manually instead of sending them out of the internet . comments are displayed on the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is to find it . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this is only if the CD @-@ CD ; identified as audio CD ; identified and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia could be read . &quot;
&quot; if this is not happening , then search in the section questions and answers after help or go back to previous section concerning the default settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully by Free@@ DB , all tracks are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window built , and you can select the database entry , which will fit your opinion on your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have selected the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) you can also manually trigger the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need to get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the title &apos; Aktu@@ ell title &apos; and the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; album &apos; .
the artist doesn &apos;t have to be entered in the field &apos; Aktu@@ ell title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual commentary box per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ DB , the CD Editor is not blank , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) but also to check if there is any undes@@ ired remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length ; at least you have a look at the tab &quot; Basic Settings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information stored at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help to the Ko@@ di@@ erer , to get more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select one entry , which is obviously not important to the style of the read CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not provide the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD Editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the given data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the tracks are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or make sure all the pieces choose from the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the button selection out of the read process , this window appears to confirm . OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; on the tab , click on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left part of the window , in the lower part of the window . &quot;
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co @-@ erer which you have not installed . pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred directly after the conclusion of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and add the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the result of parallel processes to read and en@@ code , the calcul@@ ator with an am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem when simultaneously read and en@@ code ( however , two different tracks ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded and a third order in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. and 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can download an anonymous copy today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ media package . however , you can download a package of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ package is a part of a key &amp; K@@ DE ; if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users to use the compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu has been shown after the time starting at the program , no audio CD should be seen from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what does it work ? if you read this one has already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can not reck@@ on this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ded ; may it do . at least just after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has got this section and therefore understood this section . &quot;
&quot; strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ er von &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others , he did not have some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is also supported for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by pressing the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can be in &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to K@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedures used .
&quot; seat support . if you end &amp; K@@ DE , at the end of playing a song , K@@ mid starts again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song . &quot;
you can also use a file from a &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; windows to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows fall . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and feel the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu piece or get the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you will go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ unding . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ ples LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break , or select the menu entry into the menu piece , interru@@ pts the play button , interru@@ pts the space key while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use lyrics , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you need to manually select a song , so you will have to change anything manually when you want to change anything manually if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries and lyrics . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these are played by the series . in this section , as you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to put a collection , open the collection manager first . you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ise .... click here on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ ying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . concerns the if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears again the file dialogue with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on setting up automation . &quot;
&quot; when Automatic add to the collection , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically add to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied to the opening of a piece . this collection will then be added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removal . &quot;
&quot; you can select the sequence in which the songs can be played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu selection of the menu , the songs will be played in the sequence , as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs , or remove any sequence in the menu , the order will be re@@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the Karaoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button arrow right . &quot;
&quot; in order to jump back a song , select the button pre@@ dict@@ able piece , the entry pre@@ dict@@ able piece from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button . &quot;
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter since it is stored on leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create an MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of Change patch patch to B@@ right piano in the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear only , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . pre@@ condition is that each appearance is a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and End that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that need to take this instrument on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard supports a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which can be similar to a tissue in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so now , a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( Gun up ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant with each tone a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) is and not the one that means the sound @-@ height of the same drum means that some keyboards ( like him have keyboards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how to be shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ presses for each channel and you have to use different names only in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used primarily to form tones on the per@@ col@@ on channel . take a look at the provided key maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form a few channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , simply make it easy at CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on one particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , up following the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is part of the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be defined by the name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the perfor@@ ated patch on the perme@@ ate channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio gives , in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event will be multiplied . if so , a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event , then it will be re@@ rel@@ ayed to this with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then it will be re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that the map file will not be dec@@ imal ( dec@@ imal point ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM presents that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch of a pitch of 40@@ 96 , but try to play a tone higher with the value 40@@ 96 . in order to find some keyboards up to one oct@@ ave higher . in order to get the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find in the menu below settings , item MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the Canary Islands is a window with a whole row of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos , you see which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the edge view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the Canary Islands ( up to now ) has two different views , to show the mir@@ ro@@ red tones . view the settings in the Settings menu below the point of can@@ al@@ view : settings &quot;
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed , which is played by a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the temp@@ o , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , and etc ; this may lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same sheet in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can no need to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the single instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; they have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to solve the problem you need to download and install a source code ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; understood , that is why &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open simply the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable the setup of automation to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the arrow keys from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way , I have to play when the collection is played at the end , or I have to play a file , merely in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file only if you want to add a collection , switch to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you want to play the first file . so you can adjust the setting up automation to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection includes exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! when I hear these songs or the postcard , this animated me , keep on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ iler ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , play music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , a bug or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a lot of pleasure , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke @-@ file from a local group . all of you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will receive a postcard or a MIDI file , but you should contact me when I may contact the file . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and nobody cares for anyone &apos;s money . I don &apos;t want to launch it for this because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Keep the bug to be high at AW@@ E @-@ cards .
&quot; my thanks also is Jose L@@ us Sanchez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Has P@@ etter Bie@@ ker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the web , which give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ k / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also look at the development and find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card except that of course you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message right to me . &quot;
&quot; player &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of video files or phon@@ on formats , as well as to playback DVD s , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Ma@@ iling list .
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . as an option , there is an information window that will only be displayed if there are information in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to push the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ ical stage . if you get an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ list can also be changed through direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through the application itself . you can simply select the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player . by using a sub@@ group , only the XML contents of this section will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must be selected from the menu by play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or choose another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the processing mode leave or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation during starting and editing can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify by &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / Ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during Star@@ ts doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically end by opening a different source . this would be done automatically by the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ elt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; &quot; file / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; &quot; fit ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; In the inventory of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; in the directory , some examples of S@@ MIL are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player . &quot;
&quot; there is a rider of the configuration of M@@ Player in configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the network and other things are set . &quot;
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this r@@ end@@ ition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; all must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; using the sw@@ amp @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE will be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles of application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the brows@@ ers library library . if no error occur , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; to make a pre @-@ born back@@ end for a specific M@@ ime type ( of course , only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; player &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be checked , the scanner can be configured in configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog can be found in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there you should be found to use port ( e.g. PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB to it . &quot;
&quot; as the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension is necessary for the X server . therefore , the video server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;

is there evidence of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely sure to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ins starts only slowly , why I have to test my CPU on their performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ flowing . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the final value , only the first time will check x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user interfaces and network support and will be used for comp@@ iling &amp; c@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional character application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably will be tra@@ pped on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions , these allow easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website . &quot;
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is taken into consideration . if the support for this project or documentation , the contact about the c@@ ile ; -@@ website will be made . &quot;
questions about or on the comp@@ ile of &amp; c@@ ile ; on or are desired expan@@ sions to be addressed to the mailing list c@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; functions for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; in addition , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter on the editor of &amp; Kate .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right practice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is difficult to use , can also use a La@@ o ( engl@@ .@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less challenging but more realistic accessibility is that it r@@ ammed from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s only a good alternative to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; as the other recording language includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the gener@@ alization features such as paper size , side windows and text gr@@ ats will be specified as well as a kitchen with the command \ \ 2 { document } and must be closed with the \ \ \ { document } command . &quot;
&quot; the fast @-@ entry assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a perfect function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some toll for the creation of the document . it can also be done some of the document related settings . &quot;
&quot; document classes : this will hereby be defined by the type of document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , cover &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; book &#93; , &#91; DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ pr@@ t &#93; , &#91; DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
coding : hereby the character encoding will be used . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding into UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the usually used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they can only be drained only in the box field .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users are not worried anymore . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information in this section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the repe@@ al of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ matching ) . by using &amp; k@@ ile ; it is possible to consider that some mathematical area should not be closed . however , it is possible to help you through the modest appearance of output file . however , it is possible to help you through a modest appearance of output file . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( eg . \ \ ) { order } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line for the input of the command ( eg . \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encour@@ ages the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most part and subtle element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be replaced by a mouse click on the respective and viewed . &quot;
&quot; when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; rounded file format &#93; has been created , navigating &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the medium mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as font , and other information such as font color ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and to print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the user search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked with the editor and as soon as shown on an item in the DVI ; file text is the exact opposite . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code would be cli@@ cked on the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; Master Document : this function is being used with multiple files . with a master document , the work will be simplified using other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up for project settings . &quot;
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
&quot; file transfer : in this mode , the DVI ; file on the section of the section , and it is not a call by &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; at observation of the editing tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ unding box areas should be developed for the fast integration of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the fast structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The for@@ ce@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection panel Show other features such as keywords , mer@@ gers , sheet music or instructions . the play@@ lists are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection field ) .
when using quote quot@@ ation is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; this only works if the file is necessary for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection field with the name of Gr@@ Ã Ã ¨ e is used for the definition of the font , which are set for the main text , the fu@@ sions notes , etc . , there are the following font names : &quot;
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection of options are available : 1 . the wi@@ z@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document art and nur@@ turing of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason with the hand .
&quot; the bra@@ ckets after the command \ \ \ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font to the command . if the font is not set at the start , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex needs to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the menu or of the button fast . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; however , the comp@@ iling of the document should be sought after the errors . when using quick construction should be used . when using quick construction should be started . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is otherwise treated as the rest document . for example , a report with the font is prepared . the command \ \ 2 { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } can be encouraged in the vicinity . &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
&quot; the sections are made only within the environment ( from \ \ ) { environment } up to \ \ in { environment } ) , and there is no restriction ( number ) for the extension within a environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to save the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , there are certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either by the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ start { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ t } or another environment . a single word in a set can be presented with \ \ Emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ 2 { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language , it follows a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the assistant a little text was entered , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be carried out . there should be a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to the editor ( at the internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can print or be converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; these files are produced by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ convertible or computer monitors . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; the same steps are printed as for the creation of the document ( see ) . when clicking on DVI , you can print the document using a file ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar encour@@ ages the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is created , the conversion in wav@@ ed other formats can start in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the alleg@@ or@@ ical search encour@@ ages direct leap from the editor to the right position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ der files . this must only be addressed to Modern under Settings ... tools B@@ aking up .
&quot; in order to select the preliminary search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and connect to the appropriate position in DVI ; viewing takes place . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; , with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; k@@ ile ; press and for the corresponding line . for this , &amp; c@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as text editor will be set ( Settings ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; using quick construction of the &amp; DVI , viewer should not be able to use an error . if an error occurred , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log file extension refers to the error source in the source text . in the editor , there is always the line to refer to the error in error . in order to refer the correct row , the log file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the protocol and hur@@ ry ; jumps to fla@@ wed line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the button is cli@@ cked in the tool bar , a window can be used to choose the document for the document . the default settings are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a recent document , a document may be written either by reason of re@@ written or the assistant to the quick compilation of a new document . for more information on this section are included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates are stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new model , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file will be able to create or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new presentation by using an existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , some of the strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings , settings and settings . &quot;
&quot; in creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know what character strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it will be as follows : \ \ 7 class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants , and thus the commands for the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps were completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template instead of the standard of the standard can be applied . &quot;
&quot; a presentation may be made from each &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . a simple way to build a template , should be searched for one on the internet , and should be stored under the steps below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ability and approach of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . lots of settings for &amp; Kate ; they can be done directly from the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his mates should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can get there directly with reading the chapter on the editor of &amp; Kate .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command re@@ pre@@ ference , which can be called for the Men@@ Ã ¼ aid La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains almost all commands that can find in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use it as well as their syntax . &quot;
a double @-@ click with a press C@@ tr@@ l key to balance the &amp; tex . this means that in this way the click on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with ge@@ ared lin@@ ker Mau@@ st@@ aste the output text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
&quot; when using the arrow keys , please select the source of the source text in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the different types of source codes and these are emphas@@ ized . for example , the lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can appear . this is an own way of book@@ marks within the text . the menu stamp marks the leap to the n@@ cou@@ gh or final jumps . thereby , this spr@@ ite stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that it becomes automatically the first input of a character automatically . &quot;
&quot; working is probably one of the main aspect of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate , most important features have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under control devices , the following commands are included : &quot;
&quot; orders a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contained on both sides an empty line ) . this extended meaning do not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source text . the only le@@ aning thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the query is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; the word led by the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also added a extended meaning , since this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a lot of income ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for the possibility of a part of the document , of course , it can be removed first and by pressing the button . &amp; Kate ; offers its own commands for a faster toll . under Edit , the following commands are given to the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a sales in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of machining .
it was already clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit environment for a wonderful simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ &apos; { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } is located , the end of the surroundings are spec@@ kled ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many de@@ ach@@ able ambient commands can be lost quickly , the last passage can be lost quickly . this command close the last modified environment , so that the environment structure is not dis@@ closed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also , special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that meet from Be@@ ams environment . &quot;
this command is used for the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the soft cl@@ amp .
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current group spec@@ ulations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is spec@@ kled ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many emb@@ oss@@ essed groups , groups and stap@@ les can be lost quickly . this command shut up the last modified group , so that the ru@@ ined structure of the &amp; tex . -@@ Groups will not be dis@@ closed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are two easy choices for use in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character will be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character will be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign will be used for the start of the start . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close @-@ ups for up &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double @-@ door character can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and then turn off .
&quot; it can also be used as a specific settings ( e.g. , or French ) , thereby German or fran@@ chise . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; in the drill of Shift ; En@@ tran@@ ce &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent bra@@ ins . if the current position is located within a lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , you can &apos;t just one line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a box environment , close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an extensive line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be found under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users would like to arrange the columns in tables and place all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; Activity ; seek &amp; k@@ ile ; according to the largest tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the following table , add the columns to the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code , this was installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three modes are still being installed . all these modes are available for different ways under settings . &quot;
&quot; when setting a new environment through the command \ \ , { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ \ { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the ride can be removed , the last letter of the input is removed and m@@ ute , thereby the list can also shr@@ ink the list by entering a further letters . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions are made of nat@@ ure@@ ly by selecting a command . alternatively , there is simply jump to these positions in order to work spr@@ int stamp marks and the desired parameters can be frozen . &quot;
&quot; under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; full settings on these lists are made . there can be different whales for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ents of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for the failure of environments not to be done . it can always be entered a few letters with \ \ &apos; . on the other hand , environments are often used to provide a large list of environmental commands . on the other hand , environments become so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the processing of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling for the full @-@ time evaluation mode , the menu can be completed automatically , or the button to activate the environment automatically , and it appears in \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the ambient time can be continued in a simple way and can be terminated by pressing the input bar . &quot;
&quot; once it has been completed , the environment will be closed automatically . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a lists of the lists , even a first \ \ item command is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; full settings on these lists are made . this mode uses the possibility of the full response mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its integration into &amp; quant@@ um lus ; all these tools use compass as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ documentation has worked , knows that it is still a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer need to be a graphical interface ! simply add the symbol for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to be a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the familiar work folder , then remove the current working folder and give it the choice of current working folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when my pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , each one at the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application . and with &amp; quant@@ um lus ; there is now a great graphical interface . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply let the current working folder . if not , then choose the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to a issue on the screen , your file is in@@ correct . please check the reported error and try it again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; quant@@ um lus , then the current file can be selected simply . if not , delete the current file the skins , and select the file the file selected by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they only want to know whether the well @-@ format is a well @-@ established , click the well @-@ formed verification selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; in the &amp; XML ; file specified in the &amp; XML ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification , the definition definition UR@@ I ; in file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if this file should be selected in &amp; quant@@ um lus , then the current file should be selected simply . if not , remove the current file and select the selected file using the other file of file choice . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should be named , where the file will usually be stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; yes , have little too much to do . as a result , the plug @-@ in system will benefit from the additional functionality and do not need to wait until somebody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; devices can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug@@ in or a part , we start editing the plug@@ ins menu . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialogue enables all plug@@ ins to manage and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a memory site &amp; quant@@ um lus ; this path to the Search of the plug @-@ in .
often more people work in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves to identify themselves .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can look for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates who he is . this is done by sending the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze appears as it expresses : the current selected member ( its identification ) is bold after you are : text .
nick@@ name and setting of own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage with the detection of members of the team : it can be created an event to information on the team leader , if something happens . see in further information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions that will be executed if something specific in the project is happening , so that later , how much anyone can be saved , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script which is added to the project as soon as they are added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the mailing list selected in the recipient . the add@@ res@@ can be a team or Sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i such ladder can be set up . &quot;
comments are special comments in documents . they distinguish themselves from normal comments by the following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can be selected either the note menu from the editor @-@ Con@@ clu@@ ded menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by text @-@ text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a decisive member of the team . in this case , the syntax is the name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , which is the nick@@ name of the project manager Sub@@ project leader After the enrich@@ ment and Sub@@ project guides should be led in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ name and cast@@ ors names are independent of large or small notes , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ um lus ; is a development environment for scri@@ pt@@ - and form@@ att@@ ing languages which is D@@ TD ag@@ no@@ stic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scri@@ pt@@ ing languages .
&quot; the settings are att@@ ain@@ able via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ um lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
&quot; settings can be addressed via settings Quant@@ a ... to be called . This dialog covers some pages , which will be treated after one another . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ um lus , regarding tags including car complet@@ es can be changed . entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / small notes of tags : large / small notes of automatic tags : large size / small notes , the tags are thus inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small letter of attributes : large / small copy of automatically generated attributes . normal size / small notes , the attributes will be inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above , for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and start @-@ off automatically : if enabled , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic acquisition of accent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute ret@@ aining characters in the appropriate encoding during penetration .
&quot; M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using the standard , the default settings can be restored . &quot;
&quot; standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other ways , encoded with file opening files ( where the coding of the file can be passed ) , but this setting is carried out by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . this setting is carried out by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ um lus ; created regularly securing coupl@@ ings , so that in case of power loss or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . it is not the same as storing the file . also , a backup is used regularly , according to the set time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the Edit@@ or@@ area or at its own view ( or documentation in a cart@@ on display ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
&quot; set the window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful , if the user interface has come through to change the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend ing views of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ p layout command scene . &quot;
the warning message -@@ section serves to use the possibility of switching from war@@ nings by an@@ ha@@ ken by no more questions .
&quot; to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . in regard to the various modes , see also . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure @-@ tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility can be automatically opened in the tree , the tim@@ pan@@ elling frequency of the tree , and how deep in a change in the structure is set automatically , while empty groups are found in the text , while empty groups are found in the current document , no element is found . &quot;
&quot; the area for laying of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which are devi@@ ating to the most extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it means a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ st@@ abbrevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins can be used by the third page that can be re @-@ used by any cal @-@ enabled application , on the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in the inser@@ ting of a plug @-@ in , the following plug @-@ in need to be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the Plu@@ gin , if it is not on a stand there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information will be handed over to the plug , so it can open the current file , the appropriate folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Only &quot; mode &quot; mode , check if the plug is ref@@ using the store . only plug @-@ in parts will usually refuse to store the store if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the Plu@@ gin : is this activated , then test &amp; quant@@ um lus ; if the specified information is correct . select the application also if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ um lus ; as of version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was adjusted , as well as support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bug plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows several implem@@ ent@@ ations to plug@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ um lus ; included . &quot;
use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a matching debit plug in the project settings . with the option options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plu@@ gin selection panel you can change specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of supervised variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
&quot; a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions listed . usually appears in the bottom Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) is shown . it normally appears in the bottom do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the monitor , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , manufactured , or they share the Plu@@ gin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ce . this promotion is fired by default , so that a de@@ bug is open , so it does not need to be respected . &quot;
&quot; the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , or terminated the gl@@ aze of requirements . &quot;
send a HTTP request to the server around a Deb@@ ug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger shows the de@@ bug@@ gers to begin with the execution of the script and the current line continuously . if this happens while the script is going , the execution is started , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ gers to start with the execution of the script , without information to supervised variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is done , the execution is going on , the execution as soon as a requirement is made . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , without going into the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , whereby when possible in functions and include inside faul@@ t@@ less . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go to the next thing , as if there would be the current not . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered , the monitor should be monitored . the default value appears in the variation view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ x@@ sl , is a work of Keith Is@@ dale , like this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl , is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a ball from x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that it can be found on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith . &quot;
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quant@@ um Nauti@@ lus ; you can adapt to your needs and can help you feel better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scri@@ pt@@ ing languages . they enable &amp; quant@@ um lus ; skills such as car complet@@ es and cor@@ rid@@ ors ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . day folder contain two file types , the text and instructions faster with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handmade , symbol@@ ising the text and instructions faster in a document than one user could ever enter . &quot;
&quot; S &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be operated manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create current XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; . &quot;
&quot; day XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout , and the content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ c , the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars permit a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder bear the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the day XML , whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is laid in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only be found in one document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about himself nothing else . &quot;
tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for Type Method . is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( Family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( Family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only once occur for any attribute . it puts the name and the type of attribute . additionally , it contains more tags that will describe how this attribute will be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element . &quot;
&quot; announces the source of source codes for the attributes in the day @-@ Edit@@ or@@ dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source code = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source code = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ological name within &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method@@ ology sur@@ name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . may be empty , or % day name % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group the elements of a list combined . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
determines the attribute position of a tags within a dialogue . this day may only occur for any attribute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that can be found within the defined tags : this item is an element type .
is there a list of elements that end a day . this item is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be tidy and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but watch out &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is up in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; check the window and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . at present , check only in the store of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ um lus . &quot;
&quot; for example , for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT out of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file is to be schem@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor that can be edited via D@@ TD . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be created with following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = U@@ de 1 for &amp; quant@@ um lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
a action can set actions with settings ... created . Click on new action to the same dialog :
&quot; the button 1 click on the button . with clicking the user defined , a key element can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard can be removed . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the det@@ erg@@ ents settings and inserted in execution of the action at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful promotion type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or used as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ um lus ; themselves are the quick start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ing variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file names will be removed from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ um lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ um lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above @-@ mentioned methods , an script input of &amp; quant@@ um lus may be opposed to the default input . in the selection field input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually done with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of this application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types edition : normal issue , written on the standard issue ; error messages , which will be given to the standard issue output , which will be set to the default output release : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the market language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in this case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add actions and configure . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the lower end of the window starts editing mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you use their use , enable dialog &quot; To edit the Day &quot; &quot; if available , making it possible to use when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon is not only helping you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green it is usually interpreted as going , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should , at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alled ; to insert this symbol a &amp; lt ; -@@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; ) and choice of the desired action . beside the text box , press a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is , choose it out and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button and set them away with other tags , so there are still which , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ um lus ; functions for tool@@ bars , or it should add these to better overview by some separ@@ ator to several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set up the tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to give you a quick way to access the S@@ quer@@ or . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the Tren@@ ner does not support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button on the opposite of the start button .
&quot; the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ ving of all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t exist in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder ( will be charged ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; for the normal users the possibility to add documentation for the script or form@@ att@@ ing language which you like most . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , check out in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part shall we give you the second part we treat .
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the document HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sec@@ 2.2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ onds Section 2 = -@@ 1.@@ html = 2 = -@@ # 1 = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html &quot;
&quot; the Tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is such a thing : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level El@@ ements Top element = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax = long @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
notice the # in front of G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that it is about sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess training ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ um lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ files can be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for the design of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help would display the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file association lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c , while using $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Eco@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud of being involved in the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quant@@ um lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the other resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with e @-@ mail sent , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all the other &amp; quant@@ um lus ; users are checked and only available if our team is used as correct and used for the publication . in order to signing up a full contribution , we recommend a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can send an input box ( URL preview can be empty ) and clicking OK the upload starts . &quot;
&quot; upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) menus can be instantly upload , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the integrity of the resource by testing of integrity and significance . if the integrity is given and it can be cancelled correctly . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the author &apos;s author . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ um lus , but the preparation can be processed by a D@@ T@@ EP package because hundreds of day files can be necessary in the day XML format . there is easier way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package . &quot;
conversion can be started from the D@@ TD store and convert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target name : newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folders .
DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itive line : the character string that will appear in the DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ d / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ d _ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP according to conversion : if enabled , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; according to conversion and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly introduced &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ um lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and full use of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; this chapter tries to accommodate them about these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ um lus ; little use . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ um lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and projects . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are currently being selected for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; it is now available in the joint folder structure of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use these users personally . &quot;
&quot; related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simple said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder and pattern of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the builders , the board of builders , the cart@@ els with information and the tool@@ bars . please beat in , and further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the Cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document of password , re@@ charge , delete or upload of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; legal gu@@ essing in the Edit@@ or@@ area lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic machining steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the file under the mouse pointing or open the file , when the string is described under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the Edit@@ or@@ am , the tool &apos;s tool is currently being shown . &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; quant@@ um lus , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and therefore associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , for example &amp; lt ; you can insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate to the information &amp; quant@@ um lus ; to open it and walk through . in the representation of files , project , sample positions , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation designs are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project using right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be done with then displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , programming parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category is based on the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the number of templates are always available , local templates are only used for the respective users and templates in projects are only used in the project . more to templates are available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can re@@ locate the available information on a script , such as the script will start , edit or send an e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links to an elementary element , the cur@@ sor in the document is placed on the position of the element . by the right click of an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and collection of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree man@@ ners . with him , man@@ ic@@ able attributes and name rooms can be changed . it enables the contents of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for Web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ um lus ; from the quant@@ um lus ; &apos; Docum@@ ent@@ ation@@ ite can be downloaded , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; two cart@@ els at the lower end of the window , can be achieved above the usable information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on display shows information about each in quant@@ um current script . for example , the D@@ TD used the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ els show all mistakes in the brand @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; scripts that are executed , give all errors ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ um lus , tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate @-@ site of tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; &quot;
another function of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an e @-@ mail . if they receive the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; they can deliver them in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; like any others secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; we have a number of options that can be delivered to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options you can understand . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with Star@@ ts &amp; quant@@ um lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before it &apos;s folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ um lus , is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ um lus , has been optimised for a rapid Web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions . &quot;
&quot; while effort , best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers of &amp; quant@@ um lus began to deal with a na@@ zzy idea : what if &amp; quant@@ um lus ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able brand @-@ up languages ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ um lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above @-@ mentioned claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ um lus ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; Develop@@ er community is not just this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; as it allows users and developers , as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ um lus ; enables Web developers to enhance the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity for almost every task . through the program Kom@@ ar@@ ches , they can be able to extend without any scripts . ( more about it you will find them in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development , and was quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L license and produced a commercial program .

&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time , when you can open a file , which is not taken out , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for the later usage . check out in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project deposit folder , only a bug is reported . &quot;
&quot; converted to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ notes , so they are properly displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions . &quot;

&quot; if the block selection is switched on or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift , please choose . &quot;
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are out !
looking for a string or regular expressions in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; shows the news window , or not on . that &apos;s the window , in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
turning and en@@ roll@@ out of the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the problem reporter is activated when you change to the structure @-@ tree .
shows the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if it book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next appear , depending on the position of cur@@ sors in the document . &quot;
&quot; book@@ marks of other un@@ opened documents will appear in the menu , following the fil@@ en@@ ames of other documents . &quot;
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ z@@ j .
presents a dialogue to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory , according to new files that might be there . this allows to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add it to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ um lus , you will find details . &quot;
charges a project tool @-@ burning . these are stored in the Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialogue to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bars : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialogue to add a new tool bar . this creates only the names . actions must be stored on using settings actions , or you will be asked by using tool@@ bars if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; a tool@@ bar from the point of view . this is not extingu@@ ished by the hard drive . if you don &apos;t have the tool@@ bar yet , you are asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; thus , you can send their own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; team , that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu option opens a new E@@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
allows the upload of tool@@ bars on the main server where any other can access it . see in .
invite a &amp; D@@ TD ; you can or any other has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; own coating size .
&quot; un@@ loading / re@@ modeling of the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP are to renew . if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that is currently loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allow access to the current day @-@ setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates and activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . smart inser@@ tion means that this day is denied by tool@@ bars if this day contradi@@ ct the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the options listed above . click on . clicking on activated plug@@ ins is de@@ activated . &quot;
select the output mode for the current file . the list of available control schem@@ atics depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .

&quot; immediate effect between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch mode can sometimes need or incomplete graphics . it is recommended that the box @-@ card mode , which is also the default settings , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a contract the appropriate sub @-@ window is activated . &quot;
sh@@ uts the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; main receiver .
&quot; changes in this dialogue contain any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ brows@@ ers . &quot;
address the behavior of the editor . in the Docum@@ entation of &amp; Kate . you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which you can step and follow the sequence . &quot;
&quot; this should create an help according to the mouse &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely lic@@ en@@ ched , but as with every open source project developers can help support the developers . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ um lus in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed by the top of the project , for example , after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the name for the project , for example , fo@@ o . when entering name is specified automatically . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; Project file . by default , she has saved the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the expansion web@@ z@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine , to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on setting the remote computer , an adaptation might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a joint collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , in which the tool bar for the project will be saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . if using ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be integrated . if a project is started ane@@ w , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of good th@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by plug@@ in or , by removing the skins , cl@@ ings out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the menu @-@ window profiles or with the keyboard shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ eholder possible ) will be ignored by project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; complem@@ entary option to top , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded with opening of the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bug@@ gers can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger Plu@@ gin can be set in . the de@@ bu@@ gger Plu@@ gin can be set with the option options . in addition , trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by poin@@ ter a own building list for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the window configuration , one can turn off event promotions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions will be executed if a previously specific event will occur , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not possible . &quot;
to open a different project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ z@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ um lus ; closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files , when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . there you can manage files in the current project .
&quot; files behave like this , however , the entries are missing and open ... in the correct mouse @-@ click menu : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is low to prevent removing . &quot;
the password will keep in the core memory and let them forget . this option is useful if common up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion from the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ um lus , many high @-@ loading profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server that will be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your att@@ ach@@ ers , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them stored on the plate , so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming requirements can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple divers of view , various files and tool@@ bars can replace them and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the project , or the project tool tool@@ bar , can be stored or deleted via settings tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ um lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; to own work mode . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above are the tool bar in &amp; quant@@ um lus , best on the menu tool@@ bar . use and adding . adding tool@@ bar is treated below in the section adding of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool bar can be set forth , which can be specified in the dialogue , where actions can be displayed on this or other tool bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context of the context to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up the menu with tool@@ bars , settings ... and settings are set up . &quot;
&quot; templates are the essential document reduced , code @-@ escal@@ opes and files to link . you can use templates , such as a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can move , post@@ p@@ one or any system existing directory in the storage room . templates have in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; in about the restrictions you can imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ um lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted every file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are normally added in documents using global templates . additional information for templates are available in . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple report can be produced in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the appropriate way to efficiently . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are serving as templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder tar Archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ um lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) ) and select file as a template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the repository under the project area . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on File As a template , save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection may easily be drawn with pulling and placing on the designs . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough to copy the file management functions . it can be used all file management functions , such as pulling and insert or insert over the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click in the file @-@ tree or in the project files site view to a folder on the right and secure site template , but of course it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
project plans allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; make files insert or connect with them . additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind .
&quot; the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files based in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / templates / quantitative / quant@@ um / quant@@ um / quant@@ um / share templates . each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as above . &quot;
&quot; to determine the behavior of a folder , in advance over@@ sight with the right button of mouse click on the folder and select the context menu properties . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; select a selection panel with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as soon as el@@ ter@@ able attributes can be gro@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and fits everything except the regular folders . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder . &quot;
allows for@@ warding or re@@ arranged text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already fitted with the appropriate head lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; additionally , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ um lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source editor and V@@ PL ; Editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he charges a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and an cur@@ sor will be released . then you can edit and when needed to the source code editor , in which the changes in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ sein of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . with pressing F@@ 9 mode , this mode is already enabled , the keyboard pressure is activated by a window to others , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a . you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set between synchron@@ ization and a large Span@@ i@@ ard for slow computer . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools document properties will be called . this is the processing of invisible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ Tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a Click on the list allows changing the contents , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word keywords on the content . &quot;
&quot; CSS rules are the new route to the appearance of a web browser . you can add CSS rules on the list below the list , or delete a change on the list is exactly as in the met@@ a @-@ elements , which is currently not supported by CSS rules . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to implement an external CSS styles by pressing the button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sors is as in a word processing , possible due to the arrows , possible . below rare circumstances the cur@@ sor works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted as inserted and by ref@@ using or distance . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor , made . it is to note that the insert of tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. an anchor @-@ day , surrounded by text , must be removed each other &apos;s anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some work@@ places such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bar must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining styles . unlike other programs for styles , the search for specific elements is possible and the design of the style situation can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to comp@@ ile it except &amp; K@@ DE ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE . &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without ple@@ ad . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top charged style fil@@ en@@ ames with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is the following input is possible :
&quot; in this command , this command is checked in a partial or whole match with a pre@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified model name . template &apos;s template with each QNAP option agreed that contains the string template . &quot;
&quot; all nam@@ esp@@ ace of the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules , which is defined by the X@@ SL : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; expands to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / trans@@ forms : test@@ 1 &quot;
&quot; a requested base point has to be dissolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ number . this will automatically run on the loading of the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ reviewed shortly after the start of each run . &quot;

adds the parameters by the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ D ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation to the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
&quot; execute the conversion 20 times , if --@@ it is two times , the conversion will be 100 times &quot;
&quot; the input documents are treated as HTML files , if the support has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the support is activated in lib@@ x@@ ml , the X@@ include processing of the input is enabled . &quot;
&quot; on systems with installed Read@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to / from the exp@@ iry dates of the previously executed commands . &quot;
several commands require more than one argument . quotes mark may be used to put together out@@ press as an argument ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument there will be a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only from ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name as &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of the user . on Uni@@ x@@ - or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for personal folder . on RIS@@ C @-@ OS systems there are also other environmental variables .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the posts made many changes and at the same time the objec@@ tion had been corrected . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts while meeting .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within this lines . and there was no indications of the places where maybe only the entry was changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; so , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added later . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare fast text for example , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function made much work , was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser . &quot;
&quot; 3 @-@ way combination is also fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently of each one of a piece of co@@ d and changes the original file . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files at the merge : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also give you the same and mer@@ its complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shown in the folder assembly :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates the precise differences , and also the possibilities of current color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and t@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at a summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble change if J@@ IS change the rec@@ ess . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes in one line , then displays the color , which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by only write the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 file folder
&quot; the opening dialog allows manual entry to file names , selecting a selection via file brows@@ ers ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the list box below . you don &apos;t have to specify the third file . if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be done . &quot;
&quot; selecting the button file ... you can also select a folder . if you select a file , the same or merge of folders will be selected , but for B and C , however , a file , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when assem@@ bling , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to determine immediately a output file . you may also do this step by saving . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active compar@@ ative window . in opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply connect the dialog . &quot;
you can also use pulling and deposit : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions . if you want to find out how these functions are , that would be quite a relatively big effort . you would need to copy the relevant sections simply , add and then compare it . &quot;
note : currently you can do nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only draw text in a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors re@@ interpre@@ t the drawing and put text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text box , the info line is the information line . the information line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional ) . ( if the path to a file is too long , allow the mouse to rest on the line . then , a little relief window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring plugs are assigned the letters A , B and C . A. has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is recognized , you can see on the color , which diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; right next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , white characters is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; vertical line , which separates the summary column of text , will be interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line will be shown on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the compar@@ is@@ ers ) also has a info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changes &#93; if you have the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved is the saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons ski@@ pping to next un@@ solved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find out the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ is@@ ons are used , any difference must also be solved at the same time as a conflict by the manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window marks the line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in all windows . ( this will also be the current group . ) This group will then be highlighted in the background colour of the current field , and each on the left shows a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through automatic mer@@ ging or through manual mode no further line is left over the group ; then there is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion , and perhaps again a different source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may have to copy and elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge con@@ flu@@ ence ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy the text from the result window . go carefully using this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources select the options , ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates to the image run and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard , but you can use the arrow keys to the right , right , down , side down , side down , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it by other programs , also click to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ st window , you can also use the other buttons to work . with the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between plug and transfer mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) . &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ize columns , syn@@ thes@@ ize the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section mer@@ ges and the edit issu@@ ance window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict is still considered a conflict . hence , it must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you have to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , the option will be automatically copied and the manual copy is automatically deleted . if this option is c@@ auti@@ ous , because you might refer to the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dentally . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ eil@@ ing will be saved according to the operating system operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ to @-@ feed characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use the line @-@ to @-@ feed \ \ \ \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the line end of the source files , therefore you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and list of the last used files are stored automatically and re @-@ established during the next start . ( Settings menu &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems , dialogue also provides scriptures with variable width to choose , you should not use this . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ic script will be displayed . if the chosen script doesn &apos;t support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; for systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed correctly . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically sets an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the button of the tab@@ ulator button added the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator mark will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you enter or return , the inser@@ tion of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual is then dischar@@ ged into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; you can choose which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly usual selection on the operating system used . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white characters . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back@@ drop &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a row @-@ feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others again save only one row of line &apos; \ &apos; . usually , if this option is enabled , you may be de@@ activated , but like a white characters , this option will be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; the default setting is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . the differences are still displayed , but they will be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly on very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic jump mode , this setting , as long as the result of the selection is displayed , will be used before the next un@@ interrupted conflict . &quot;
&quot; automatically dis@@ solves all the conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you &apos;re using it only from time to time , then you use better the functions W@@ ähle A / B / C for all un@@ suitable white conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning from folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this is deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; this option does not fit the language of user interface . you need to end and restart the current program . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set beyond the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry , if you activate this option , all entries are used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; about the selection fields for the encoding appears a short note , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this is influenced how special characters are treated and interpreted , as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared with different coding and be merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can design@@ ate what code is to be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ fabri@@ cation , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only place with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can design@@ ate the encoding of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn off this way to supp@@ ress from changes in white characters in the text or opinions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a colour coded over@@ sight column are displayed ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal still one second over@@ sight column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . if you &apos;re using only two files , click the merge and use the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as a pre @-@ installed name for output file . ( if this function is used to execute the merge , then the name of the last used output file is used . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , they will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your requirements . you can use this feature for example or correct the insert . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified , the output of the command is used only when the command line is used . you can have your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your requirements . each input line must have an associated issue line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff @-@ results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would like to program that in most cases , or per@@ l completely . &quot;
&quot; in this context , use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command to transform the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s text file in the string . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the folded text in capital letters . &quot;
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords in order to add generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . now the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with experiments , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ t . used &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ des sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi . &quot;
sometimes you might want to carry several impressions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the entries from each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ gies are needed in per@@ l some details otherwise . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for displaying and merge . the further operations change only the data , which looks the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor has the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that doesn &apos;t change text or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders compare and merge .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adapt the proposal before the start
... can the merge sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without them to do
... select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is similar to the same and merge of individual files . you need to open only folders at the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders will be merged , folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to select the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the folder , you are informed a small message window about the current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder was found during the scan , shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together , by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories and add all sub@@ directories to the left / right . &quot;
&quot; when double click on a file , the file sharing will be started and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation can not be automatically selected . if the cl@@ ash will be started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black are used . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is identical , even if the age of entries varies . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical , if their total content is identical . then , folders are the same color . in case of folders , the age is un@@ parall@@ eled for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow will become yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such in@@ correct objects exist , the merge can &apos;t be started . &quot;
&quot; a and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such in@@ correct objects exist , the merge can &apos;t be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is enabled , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder was specified . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the comp@@ action action , so that both folders are identical . if necessary for one entry ... &quot;
&quot; a and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after M@@ erging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select the new file , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , the merge can &apos;t be started . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a file after the others will be handled . the status column displays Fer@@ tig , if the mer@@ ging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected is finished , you should see a last review and see if the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in alignment dialog the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can merge either the selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have chosen all inter@@ assem@@ bling actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a target folder , then in the Three @-@ folder M@@ erging mode C is used as target and syn@@ cing A and / or B as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
to bring all entries to the list / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ holes ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contra@@ dict@@ ory file types there are still invali@@ dating actions , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run , sim@@ ulating and break . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see what would happen , if you want to see what really changes would be made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together of a single file ) , then a merge window opens up ( note the screen photo ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select directories start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not saved , a corresponding dialogue appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list , you &apos;ll see some error messages that can help you select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to run another promotion to the entry , or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the cooperation . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually merged , see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them not again together . even if the merge doesn &apos;t be stored or not saved , these entries are considered closed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
&quot; the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 to set up ... ) now has a section called directory co @-@ merge with these options : &quot;
only files that are shown on the specified pattern are shown in the elementary @-@ tree . the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .
&quot; files and folders that conform to this pattern are not shown in the elementary @-@ tree . it can be entered into elementary @-@ tree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that conform to this pattern are not shown in the elementary @-@ tree . it can be entered into elementary @-@ tree , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
ignore files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ Sign@@ s file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , file attributes will have a file attribute . in other file systems it marks a preceding point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in elementary @-@ tree or not . this option is switched on . &quot;
&quot; on links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic link are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links are displayed . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched off , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not crash@@ es on a file of a link to itself . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file carries and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ adulter@@ ous , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if they are applied to files that do not contain any text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder about a slower network , it may be compared to the changing date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security . please note with caution . this option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; similar to confidence date . it does not find a real comparison . the files are considered identical , if they are identical . that can be useful if copying the date date . please note with caution . this option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target file specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merge will be selected , and the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of the merge the copy of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ original If an old backup file with the .@@ original extension is already deleted , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the file @-@ merge view is visible in the mer@@ ging of single files ; you can turn off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to turn off the main window in the window menu , turn off the main window frames between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file easy using double @-@ click . however , there is also a single menu entry . you can use a single file directly together without only the folder , the status will be reset , and the file will not run again when you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost , if you read the directory once again : read the directory menu : new read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 is used to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively simple . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations : &quot;
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows . then a file is accepted as link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . hence the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( please note the option of confidence in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
&quot; the main purpose of the purpose is currently as a differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts always the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right button on the differences and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files , but if it is used as a part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the comparison of folders is not supported in the box mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now , it is Com@@ mit ) already exists . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 suggests that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have gone to this path or are going to be so .
&quot; you will probably compiled the program from sources and configure the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters varies , these lines are first treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines for next to Each other , this is of these , is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is noted for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is necessary , however , if the result is simply saved as text file , and it is too much effort to design an extra @-@ own file format that may save this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this was so far too big . you can use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C , which should be used to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing the text is suddenly l@@ lt ; No sr@@ c left , and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean , and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using , and missing the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and trou@@ bles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild game Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
&quot; for information , how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage . &quot;
you can find a list of recent changes in htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command folders of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker uses , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mailing lists thereof . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or um@@ sch@@ ema ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switching input ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board on the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to re@@ read changes to these options with the function Update . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are showing that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the target file doesn &apos;t already contain these files . ( behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the Lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines are already available ) , they will be removed during the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . understanding in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the working areas , to change its size , to finish it or move it . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as in the current applications . applications can be selected and can be moved on the working area and to other .
&quot; with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context and the name of the application , as well as entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , click on Desktop and editing . the commands are following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window onto the full size of the desktop . only appears when an application has been cli@@ cked on .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when an application has been cli@@ cked on .
&quot; if this check@@ box is marked , windows can be moved inside the &amp; box ; it can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the name of the virtual working areas will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; cruci@@ fy this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual work areas . if it comes together with name , the names will be provided with ordained , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each working area is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty space areas will be displayed in order to provide their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classic , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n rat , shows all virtual work areas in a horizont@@ ally and vertically in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini@@ program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can display in size , display window as symbols or with their content and move outside the control panel . &quot;
Click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select sel@@ ector switch to switch ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in dialogue settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you have to apply the key to win@@ dow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ mode and to as@@ sign up to your system administrator in this file . possible values are : &quot;
there &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages .

&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen of screen . you can use with &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen size , so you would be interesting for different users . this application includes artists , web designers and people with a visual view . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly being expanded with new functions . it is optimised for use on powerful computers . &quot;
&quot; when you &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following window , this window is displayed as an enlargement window . in the following window , this window is displayed as an increase window . &quot;
in the default setting up &amp; k@@ mag ; the range around the mouse hand like a mov@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively you can use &amp; kiss ; to provide a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not yet able to recognize the form of mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection process mode , you can change the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and bri@@ ga@@ ze and change its size . this can be made in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlargement window , and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fying glass . this is also possible with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift , press and use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the box office remains firm and just move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to printer , in a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
starts / stops the updating of the ad . the stops of the updating causes the needed CPU time to 0 .
&quot; the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a select window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; automatically automatically upload your set @-@ commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and pan@@ eling &amp; etc ; &quot;
may also known as &amp; k@@ ins@@ fier ; you can use a screen pump . you can use a magni@@ fier ; to use a range of display in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people of use : from resear@@ ching or artist to web designer or se@@ han@@ dicapped .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive ear inhibit@@ ing syndrome ) , and in which each mouse click pain@@ s . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , once the mouse pointing a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate pain on the repet@@ itive forms of In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . however , this requires a little bit exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when clicking the mouse , so many people can use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may look for pain that are related to your computer using the use of your computer , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the use of mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be reduced to each other . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after the pressing of the mouse button is em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before removing the mouse button . the smart shifting requires a little bit of exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
this ref@@ us@@ al time must suff@@ ice after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; it is enabled , Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the rot@@ or shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set before the mouse button is waiting for the mouse button , if the mouse button is rest@@ rained , if there is no problem in the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow@@ ed down to the right and back leads a double click . this movements will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can cut &amp; K@@ DE ; to reduce the reaction time . open it to sound &amp; multimedia , select Sound System and here the rider General . there is a slide show sound buffer which you can set on a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; started . this feature is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window frames , please select the respective documentation to determine how to start there a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back to the values , which were set when opening of the dialog . have you already pushed the button to the button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of application . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent shift should be switched off first . if you want to get used to the automatic mouse , you can later go to the smart shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should make aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : the click on the neutral components of windows or in places on the browser window that doesn &apos;t link to un@@ intenti@@ onally reactions . you can therefore par@@ ked the mouse to such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ les , you should clean your mouse . it is usually rather simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take out the mouse ball . as it happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear when you see the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with flat blade or finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interru@@ pts the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re using this intelligent shift tool , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation does not mean more by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you yourself can run a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to cli@@ cked and cli@@ cks the cur@@ sor on another spot . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to place him . but you can &apos;t make the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you don &apos;t want to cause the mouse click un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter &amp; slip ; the grey surfaces around the tool@@ bar and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart shifting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit the text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very comfortable possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and again insert any other action here , but it will probably only cause problems . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart shifting , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead of the text area and hold down the switch button , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and again the mouse button . &quot;
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this allows every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the smart shifting the shifting time without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window , which should be installed on most system . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ ble cli@@ cks feature is only available , if the system has a sound@@ card and loud@@ speaker system and are properly furnished . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointing short . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and for which the bet@@ ting of the mo@@ sten pain@@ s are prepared . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the m@@ ute user you can talk to their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , m@@ ute users can talk to the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of talk sets which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first side of the wi@@ z@@ ard ( left screen ) , enter the command , which later is used for the language edition of text . further details will be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second hand , select the standard text password book . you can often choose text passages , without need to type . the word passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third side ( right screen ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ ti@@ bility . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the speech lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly arranged and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard layout of your sentences ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a run memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
&quot; if you are mouth ; right , you can enter the phr@@ ases which you want to hear . every spoken sentence is attached to the run @-@ memory . you can select from it sentences which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; set up with the Settings menu settings ; set up ... open the installation dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialogue contains two flash@@ cards , language edition and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ rier and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map language output , enter the command to call the language name . in the selection field under the input field , insert the character encoding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is unchanged as a standard entry to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be distributed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
of course the command depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this you will find in app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; if you &apos;re using as a lingu@@ istic service as a lingu@@ istic service , the further settings will be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD language . if this is successful , the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a standardized interface for speech output . the option of this option is convenient , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field campaign , after selection of a text passage , you determine which action triggered by the key passage or by choosing a text passage in the menu texts or in the vest for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the run storage . in addition to the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is initially only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection panel closing of the editing box for textbook book , you can set whether the textbook book when switching the handling equipment is to be saved automatically . &quot;
&quot; the book is stored with the selection of Text@@ lab@@ elling book . if you select changes , the textbook book is not stored . choose before saving , will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the textbook book is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ rier contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ter@@ restrial . in the main window , next to the Command box shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a select field where this list can be used more than a dictionary . with this selection panel , you can choose the currently used dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books , or exp@@ orting it into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads then the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words will simply be determined by aby@@ ss . in addition , you can compare the word list using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add just correctly described words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these weights are to be taken . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly created words automatically adds to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the window for processing text passages is two divided . in the upper part , the text passages are presented as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard box . if you have chosen a textbook book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add the actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order of text passages or text passages , with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key change . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field an text section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the pan@@ cre@@ atic memory . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field an text section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the pan@@ cre@@ atic memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the pan@@ cre@@ atic memory . &quot;
this menu entry is indicated by default with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged directly under the editing window . by mouse click on the sh@@ amed left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another spot .
&quot; is this menu entry to be crossed , a narrow base in the lower part of the main character with references to the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is bl@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is indicated by default with entries . the glue is arranged by default on the editing window , directly under the tool window . by mouse click on the sh@@ amed left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another spot . &quot;
&quot; probably you &apos;ve probably entered the command for the language edition , not correct or not fully entered . open settings &#91; mouth &#93; , open the page General Settings and give the command for speech output on the map output . ( see installation dialog for speech syn@@ thesizer to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and French are supported . the license allows to use it for free and dis@@ semin@@ ate without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; for example , to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and dis@@ semin@@ ate without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the creation of the language edition , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ettes . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following command samples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to send data as standard entry . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it turns a list of phon@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / lem@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax liked the last sign of the text so that additional characters must be added . the full command is therefore more agile than in other examples : &quot;
( CAT - ; ech@@ o quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data must be turned on to default .
the language issue of the language version of the K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; further language service available at all &amp; K@@ DE ; K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
&quot; because the language requirement is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use as a kt@@ ts@@ d as language services in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the K@@ TT@@ SD language services , which is installed in the installation dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth . if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t talk to people who can &apos;t talk about text by the calcul@@ ator . it will be saved by a list already , which users can re @-@ leave the user again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer . on the calcul@@ ator must be a language syn@@ thesizer installed .

&quot; &amp; c@@ ts ; - The language issue system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is one of the existing service , which enables each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for language edition ( T@@ TS ) , it is a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer ready to be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . even users offers interesting opportunities . &quot;
read texts ( or parts of them ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications embedded .
&quot; the language edition is performed via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; &quot;
allows the creation of language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; program program .
&quot; future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without any visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d on the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; conv@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; , with which a text file can be read or partially read . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you have to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker are set , the cart@@ on speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the cart@@ el card is shown . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer provide various languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or such that is described in volume or speed . you should also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker before you &amp; c@@ ts , as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various spokes@@ man for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple print @-@ ups for the same printers .
&quot; if you click on the board of board speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the board speaker is displayed . this also appears automatically if you run kt@@ ops and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all the speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for the language output when there is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the actors in the list determines its priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; business system ; -@@ system .
&quot; here you choose one m@@ oods type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ k and girls to choose from . &quot;
&quot; Click here . if you click here , the new speaker is on board speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; go back to map and check if language output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; K@@ DE ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . Click on the board of orders to create text orders and to manage text . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a speaker at least one speaker , you can open the language system of &amp; K@@ DE ; Click on the cart@@ el card of General to open this cardboard card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts . this start successfully , the board card orders will be displayed and you can read text orders and read . see the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is adjusted and the T@@ TS @-@ system of &amp; K@@ DE will be disabled . &quot;
&quot; if it is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is able to activate the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , when reading is automatically published in the system range of the inspection bar , it dis@@ appears once the advance is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can stop text orders , stop , stop and record . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this range , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to advance . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; Click on application or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cart@@ el card of General and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text which should be read , and select in the main menu tools text . after short time the language edition should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ st@@ lines and other invisible stamps are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read out the text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts . then check the text which will be read , and select in the main menu tools text . then , the language edition should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system by &amp; K@@ DE , which you notify about you fixed events . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . read the message . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set different types of messages . for example , you can notify different types of messages when you enter your nick@@ name . you can then read the IR@@ C news text in the IR@@ C channel . you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in menu settings of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on application . &quot;
&quot; it is a good example in &amp; kt@@ ts . it is a good example in &amp; er@@ ts . it is a good example . it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by the mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box because this can be assumed in most cases . read it also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , Text edited , before it is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to in@@ correct the words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a matching speech or short@@ com@@ ings , or to avoid certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; c@@ ts , diff@@ ers four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ read all the other orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the requested orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and holds the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message is interru@@ pt normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that is used . while you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a web site . you can also welcome a long text on a website . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read more about this .
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each mission you encounter from the cart@@ el orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications which uses text entries . text entries are intended for the issue longer texts that have no special dr@@ ink@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ e , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application is sending the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a reads , this output will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . they are applied on normal war@@ nings , messages and text entries as well as &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters work the text and put it on the next filters . currently there are three kinds of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there can still be any kinds of filters .
replace parts of a text by other text . these parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions like : - ) by text or for form@@ att@@ ing messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . there are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker systems , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have sent a female voice , you can read text from K@@ DE messages to read about this . sie@@ ve . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has a adjustable rules , after which it is used for a language output . if the filter determines its rules , he will continue the text unchanged at the next filters . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification is sent to &amp; c@@ ts ; it will be sent through all activated filters that have been set up at the bottom of the list below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished standard filters . if a filter does not cross it , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be turned from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be shown below the following setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; for the set of drawing chain filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged against the matching replacement text . large and small notes will not be regarded when compared . &quot;
&quot; for your filter , enter a name . this name can be chosen to distinguish only from the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text by character strings in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column , which is displayed in the displayed sequence from above . &quot;
Click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , store the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file is attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter will only be applied when the speaker for the text order is one of the here registered languages . Click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key . &quot;
&quot; if a value is registered , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can set multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you will receive the q@@ d@@ bus application program with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; and the bus numbers need you to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application @-@ ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter . &quot;
&quot; the animation filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character filter indicator uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. meaning the words must be limited by separ@@ ations ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; setup &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; you &apos;ll find a copy in the package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such res@@ sions . but it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker indicator , you can send text to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to select a speaker with specific features . you can design@@ ate the text of k@@ mail from a female voice . see also . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts , there is a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen to send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts , and the characteristics of the speaker map are chosen . using the speaker system , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is registered , the filter is applied here , if the text contains the printed regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can be installed using a click on the button to get help . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to tail@@ or the regular expression at the beginning of character string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you put the properties of your desired speaker system . if the text is filled the above @-@ shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected to show the desired requirements at the right . Click on the button to preview the dialog . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save or load , or delete all settings . &quot;
&quot; the speaker indicator filter is applied only in the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the language output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD can be added , allowing you to use these syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of the language edition API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility Website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require speech output services via the &amp; D@@ DE ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text to read and option an language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you will give .
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; windows . start @-@ in in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ converting filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to do so when you do not use this voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences will ski@@ pped , or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a character string . &quot;

&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; convert , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the Pack@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts , refer to the source archive for k@@ de@@ an , transl@@ ating or install any night currently at the moment , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer correctly . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; 4.4 is the first version of the program to be developed , the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be so developed that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can return or leave the user , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the features of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker , this is used , otherwise it will select the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you will see a speaker you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the board speaker , you can click on add or click on the list or click on Edit , the cart@@ el @-@ card device is shown below . for example , the creation of the module for festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules are listed below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in voices , the &amp; c@@ ts are announced , this setting will automatically use that Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , nor@@ theastern languages such as Czech or slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ian ( ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ p@@ ers , you make volume , speaker speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select a number of controllers and displayed this gray , the voice will not be displayed by you . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes will need to be loaded several seconds because of their size , these voices will already be charged at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box can &apos;t be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker ( or don &apos;t forget to click on application ) . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is marked , the program window is marked at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window . otherwise , the program window is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD appears to read a text . therefore , you have the opportunity to stop or control them otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the board speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this range , you can go a two @-@ trip on the order , which is selected in the list below , pre or return . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cart@@ on cards ) will be taken and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text orders listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws , War@@ nings and News will not be displayed . for more information about the message types of &amp; c@@ ts . find in . &quot;
&quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , compiled &amp; c@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , can &apos;t load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de are used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also : &quot;
&quot; adjust the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half a half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal speaking speed , so that settings can be implemented , the SO@@ x program must be installed . &quot;
Click to apply the new settings for the running &amp; business system ; -@@ system to take over .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works on you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this cardboard map , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; c@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ read all the other orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the requested orders will be resumed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be resumed after the warning of warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message is interru@@ pt normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; yet somebody welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; get a text order by a message , warning or the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , adds &amp; c@@ ts ; the audio edition in waiting for a queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played , when a normal text order is interrupted , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this cardboard card are only valid for normal text entries . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ws there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
to read with &amp; c@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages start to run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and Click al@@ erts . the map Noti@@ fication appears .
&quot; mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications not be marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; c@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , with which one sound is played , by &amp; c@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; to add these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that send &amp; conversation ; if anyone menti@@ ons your nick@@ name in a IR@@ C message .
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else mentioned , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts , if an event hits . you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard elec@@ ts the speaker , which is shown in the list on board speaker as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event is specified for a specific application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be implemented for all other events of certain application . otherwise the action is to carry out the action under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can design@@ ate the read al@@ erts as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button Save to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button loading , to stored stored settings from a file . if you want to begin using an empty list , click on delete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language edition . this standard includes trademarks for controlling the control of voices , speaker speed , volume , gender voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently there are &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML are only partly and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you have to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used for the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch dialog can not be set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE / / D@@ TD / syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE / / D@@ TD / syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; ? asked Mama Bear . who slept in my bed ? asked the bear son . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ positi@@ onal filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows you to be syn@@ thes@@ ized in particular sentences , as only the first proposition can be syn@@ thes@@ ized or stop or stop , even if the language syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you can also add a pro@@ positi@@ onal filter automatically . you can change its settings , or add another pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter , but will be off@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; on the easiest way , you will learn the setup of speaking selection through out . check out the speaker selection , change the speaker selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker needs . to do this , you need to change more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; follow &amp; c@@ ts ; then faster with reading can begin , as only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole word block , which can be very long , &quot;
&quot; you can stop text orders on the board card orders , or ab@@ ort , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter will automatically be set up when you run it to the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know anything at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ positi@@ oner filter comparison with a regular expression for sat@@ in and add a tab@@ ator mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal character ( t@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) from the filter automatically from the text ) . note that the default setting of proposition can be derived from the string . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied on &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( k@@ gs ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you come from Ver@@ see the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , you can add it again by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the board card speaker selection , you can re@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the board map is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the board speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker characteristics .
&quot; use of the matching speaker system , which shows all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise it cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise it cho@@ oses the speaker , which was the most mentioned above . &quot;
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the select buttons .
&quot; please choose the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; mark this check@@ box , if the property should have priority ahead of other features . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in the output of the output , it will always be used as a priority feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language if you may know that a certain application text in another language has been sent in the work environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speaker , which is subject to clear , click on the select button , and then use speaker , which corresponds to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is set for the final text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ ells immediately crash@@ es when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability .
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is shut down and &amp; kt@@ ts . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x . if the problem is not solved , you may have a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update g@@ amer or un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA is not working when I cont@@ end with another application music . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : &quot; to open PC@@ M &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA occur that preventing a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can not use them in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices add the new voice . if you have successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; if you have found the voice , please send the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; based on the cardboard card audio , there is a setting speed . thus it works , the program SO@@ x has to be installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ s such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( that is what the HTML is turned into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you &apos;re very brave , change the .x@@ yz file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML res@@ h@@ aping filter , and set the talk speed up . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that websites with a female voice be read . I have set a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the X@@ SL file puts no error to converting SS@@ ML according to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER tags . same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a back@@ sliding filter , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not appear anymore or return . on the cart@@ el orders , orders will appear only from a set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; inter@@ section sign ( point , question , exit sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out for this sign instead a filter for sat@@ lan@@ der@@ mal detection . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )
g@@ amer in the version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : make sure the modules for g@@ amer are registered in front of the use of G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t stop playing music and run a text , then you can start a text order and then start a further start . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de hasn &apos;t supported any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the SO@@ x audio program is used for the general setting of microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included . &quot;
&quot; have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ packing the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed , or at least on request only . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are produced by default . some of them have a run @-@ up movement of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of Deb@@ ian distribution ) , the configure parameters indicates the input of the setting . &quot;
&quot; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . with many votes you can adjust volume , speaker speed and pitch @-@ height with &amp; c@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions given to the festival . would you like to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) Voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code for festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in the dis@@ closure . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you must set for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a c@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions , look at the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c , for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; syn@@ thesizer takes over . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ icals analysis and mb@@ rol@@ a ; the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; no complete voice system is . &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . this is produced by &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; required Di@@ phon@@ e t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under review .
&quot; for this method , additional Wra@@ pper code is added to the festival , to use &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ voices are not installed in the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ folders are not installed in the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ folders are not available , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions &quot;

&quot; ep@@ ox@@ y is a fre@@ er @-@ free speech syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this language syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; you can start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the cart@@ on board speaker you can click on adding . if the ep@@ ox@@ y programs do not stand in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the cart@@ on board . in the input fields you can get additional parameters for the programs . enter in one &amp; Con@@ sole ; epic -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain further information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ oped voice syn@@ thesizer , which is written in &amp; Java ; you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust sound level , volume or voice speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module enables you to use &amp; c@@ ts , with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be attached to the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command to send the language output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; control center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; control center ; allows users to manage a range of systems and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; control center ; can be accessed by K menu @-@ control@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; create the users a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module &apos;s network settings are displayed in &amp; control center ; network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting from k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already working properly installed and configur@@ able , that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all shows and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on installing and Linux ; network appliances are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , accordingly to the kernel version . &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded , when the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . during the launch of the module network settings , this system tries to recognize the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the hanging choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release date . by marking the setting non @-@ again issues the definition can be taken permanently . during the next start of network settings , this selection will then be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; change of network settings are possible only in system management mode . before , all options are grey , which means that settings can only be viewed , the change mode is not possible . in the system management mode you can reach the right bottom of the module . it is the input of password required . &quot;
in the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the network interface is used to manage network devices . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out :
&quot; the desired network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list , click the button and click on the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings Advanced Settings offers further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection automatic , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system simultaneously . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the select list may be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , accordingly to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the manual Manu@@ ally , the TCP / IP address can be carried out without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask is fixed to the sub@@ net@@ mask . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface in bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device box .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering a TCP / IP address , you can determine whether the desired address is already used . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;

&quot; determines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected in which the Gateway Computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers may only understand IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , trig@@ gers DNS this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for a name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name solution enables easy access to this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS entries can be re@@ arranged by selecting a contract and clu@@ sion in the list using buttons , or drop in the priority . &quot;
by clicking the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to a name resolution can add an DNS server . it will add the new nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution choose one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog .
&quot; the list of nam@@ eless calcul@@ ator describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of nam@@ eless calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will be able to replace this version of IP in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known machine and click to add .... The dialogue New also is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the button . if the known machine has several alias names , select de button to press several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog can work on the computer .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the following command needs to be set . &quot;
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source . &quot;
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough , if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
&quot; the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package , and install in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows : &quot;
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE will be sufficient for this case but also the development packages with libraries and others are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands should afford this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
this segment can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . it has never seen large spread . IPv6 is expected to pass through in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is possible . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to be able or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be selected . in any case , IP address can not be selected . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a own small ( home ) Network , IP address should be selected for this purpose in order to avoid IP address data using the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded in the Internet . therefore , their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large for networks up to 250 computers large enough .
&quot; in addition , net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections sometimes , so it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , another content is defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE , which is therefore expected . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat , is a backup program for tape drive on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was a question for tar to create a question that my wife did : how much longer will it take when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat , which can happen to three ways : &quot;
&quot; and k@@ dat , mo@@ ck the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the ban@@ des . recognize &amp; k@@ dat , the incident on the tape will not be asked if the band is to be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat , the incident , looking for the appropriate index on your plate . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked if the tape index should be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the band movement to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by , through the edge of the band . &quot;
&quot; before dis@@ card the tape , initially the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat , can be seen by a change of symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat is used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use data using data using &amp; k@@ dat , this process does not need to format the tape before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy drives usually use a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives not on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat , with the format of the tape . all data on the band will be lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the desired files . this may happen to three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in a local file @-@ tree . it will only be secured this file or the folder .
mark a coll@@ ision profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile specified .
mark files in local file @-@ tree with a skins . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; with the right mouse button on the local file @-@ tree , and select in the menu of Sich@@ uan ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings are opened for backup . in this dialogue you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears secure . dialogue shows the progress of the securing process , including the data rate , and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is checked , only the selected file or folders . &quot;
mark the files in one of the archives in an entry for the band with a bun@@ k@@ ets . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
&quot; once the testing process has been started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , check the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re @-@ establish the re@@ construct , the files must be restored , which can be re @-@ manufactured . this can be done to two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folders are recovered . &quot;
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ k@@ ets . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
&quot; with the right button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select from the menu ... &quot;
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialogue shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it shows itself as necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file from the band content . this process will delete all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index to two types of volume :
&quot; by this , a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings are created . you can make the following adjustments for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup is to be made . list of noti@@ fications files will automatically be updated accordingly to the selected employer folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , are known that only the files are stored in the same file system , as the folders . file that are on other file systems can be used separately on the other file system . each entry is considered by tar independently of the other . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used since the last incre@@ mental backup . only the files saved , which have since changed since . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shots in front of the call of tar . this ensures that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file will be applied for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ boot version of the band device .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the volume is tied to the drive . for some drives this is necessary , before reading or write operations can be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat , to un@@ lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the integration of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , will automatically be cast out automatically . use this option not for Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat , the hard@@ war@@ fare block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; k@@ dat , in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a band is form@@ at@@ ted , writing a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file sets itself as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host name : seconds , whereby the host name is the full name of the system , which was form@@ at@@ ted on the tape . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ at@@ ted in which the band was form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not work in incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the content of a backup cover . this symbol is only active when a volume is integrated .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can &apos;t know information about your system or where the system allows information about your system or where the system allows information on problems relating to information on problems that appear on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , which can not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system does the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users brows@@ ing the fast access to information on problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , some extended functions will provide , with whose help the protocol files can be filtered and analysed . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log has a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g @-@ Ser@@ vers and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included in addition to the other chapters of this manual page .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen picture , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with whose help allows the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file easy to filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual page . &quot;
&quot; after starting to start &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; initially , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of its a small message window , so you &apos;ll find &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log . the protocol files will normally be found in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or after sub@@ set string . in the default settings , select the log box below . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the filter search deal@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . then , the string of the filter search concept will then be selected only with entries in accordance with selected column . select the name of a process , so you enter &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines , which were sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of the stage . the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can see the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may be useful if you want to investigate the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the new lines in the context menu of the main character in order to display all new information lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ plugs . to open this feature , use the entries in the window to open and manage . once you select a sub @-@ window , select a protocol for viewing . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website to htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum software softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .

&quot; welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section performs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control of the system start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further to historical aspects ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it @-@ binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why anyone could try to insert a machine on system V in@@ it , without a new installation and new format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there . &quot;
&quot; the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it diff@@ ers from the BSD input , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder / etc are instead of / etc . this file is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you will need a script for any system service that you want to start running at the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as offset , which is only once again . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be on one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if there are actually not much use for this . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ f. in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something to do with the serial connection . &quot;
&quot; the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first , which he finds . &quot;
the default lap level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see the first line as the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ installed lap level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can fix / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to manually restart the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? easy : any of scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start scripts out of hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will be called by the argument , the script will be accessed using the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could register &amp; eg ; a server @-@ Run@@ level , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user @-@ run@@ level ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not tri@@ vial : go just one entry from the field of availability systems to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere . this is done only if it is done by its original run@@ level ( or his position ) . this is done only if they go out an entry from the availability of availability .
&quot; note : entries are moved into a new range . to copy them to a new run@@ level , you need to select explicitly copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu - even then if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the promotion . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry cannot be calculated sometimes . in such cases , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there are no possibility to restore entries which were thrown into the paper basket . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the various work areas ( Available Systems Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of Ober@@ - or below the previous . &quot;
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired lap level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change sorting order or name , press button to open the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to accept the button button to accept the changes , or press Ez@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) . &quot;
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for execution under Run@@ level X but they are not executed .
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the species , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simplified the configuration for proprietary integration programs in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; htt@@ p@@ d ) do not end without any message , if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send us more about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
