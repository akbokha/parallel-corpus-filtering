<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scaled leukemia values over the entire image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same: this method is adjusted the luminous factor of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. it is the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that works either miracles in a picture or destroyed."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automated: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and bright margins and adjust the rotor, green and blue channels on the entire history grammar area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by shifting the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digigians; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white-like photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-equal correction is slightly limited to a colour space with 8-bit per color, so if you can do too far from the original picture, if you can perform the white downstream in rough mode, if you are working in the 16-bit mode, your possibilities will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-equinfusion of the copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. they start the menu entry in white colours.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the window window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original image and preview can be seen as well as the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original whitch, then it's enough to click on the window."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target group features a red markers. the luminance of the Pipe under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"to the right above, a histogram is shown that dynamic is changed once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful because, even in well-lighted pictures, most pixels are very small Luminance values. with one button you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadows Adjustment lets you improve your photos of your photos or down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"with the aforementioned inspections, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere you select the image color for the calculation of the colour temperature of the white. on this type, the temperature and green values are also set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white comparison with the default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">"the overload capacities increases the colors, when more than a colour channel of the pigeon is overexposed. it will display the combined earnings in the white image. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image."</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loading do exactly this. every setting of the Weißabnormalities you have set to store you in a text file and then recharge again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the button preferences set aside all filter values to their standard values and the associated neutral white abnormalities. please note that neutral settings will be a different photo as your original. if you store this, your original image is changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"here you can adjust the codisprocket per colour channel of the processed picture. however, it is better suited to high quality images. however, this coding requires even more turntables, calculation time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog like the processing of resource files. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tension can be carried out through the window frame for the usage of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu in color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error. in the manual on audio correction, you can find further information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digiance; tool color effects gives you four color effects, a solar cell effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect of the picture was developed when one partially developed the development of the picture. the result was a partial negative aspect of the picture, and the result was a partial negative image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting impact well."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the Solarisation. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is possible. another increase is finally generated with a negative image that is not shown on photography."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges in order to make a picture sharpened. actually it's not a little bit, it works rather psychaudiovisell. you can use it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"it is possibly the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus and most digitised images require a correction of sharpness. this is the fact that the digitisation process can be printed with just minimum differences to a color point. the same phenomenon will be observed even if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras will usually need more retrospectively sharpening as normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG image, a camera internal sharpening was used frequently. however, images in the base format must always be sharpened."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners turn a sharpening filter during the reading of the image. if you enable this deactivate, you will receive control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo of sharpening keysters. you can call the menu entry with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should be careful to circumvent the results, as the results are not very natural. sharpening the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the sound system. in general, you will find more information about the menu entry correlate. under recurring, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is significantly easier than it. use the tool to soften softness and experiment with settings. the window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter insharp masked is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help edit the image. the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values are often good results and should first be tried again. if you make the correct mask to make the effect, noise and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges are possible."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius displays how many pixels are affected by the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should make pictures best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image, added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the corresponding difference. one can define a minimum difference thus for a channel of filters. in this way, areas with a soft transition between sharpness and therefore beauty errors can be avoided in faces, celery and water surface."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digip; tool Refocus is focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected unfolding filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">"this tool tries to make a picture to & quot; refocusing system; it is a better approach to sharpening images. it is used to make a technique called FIR Viennas. it is used to use a technique called FIR Viennas. it is used to run a technique called FIR Viennas. you can start-focus on the menu by moving colors."</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's fission. the Gauß's fission is also a very long tail, which leads far from the original quellas, which is far from the original quellpixel, which is affected by far from the distant pixel. caused unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameters for use of this module. for most of the pictures the default value should be 1 good results. you can make a higher value if your image should be very unsharp then but then on Heiligendamm.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values can be reduced from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 is very poor. if the space filter is too low; the image quality is 0.03. a high value will still decorate the picture."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your infirmament Gauß is. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value of zero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filters."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformer size. however, you want to create good results, especially if you select big values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the store and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameters that you have set is stored for later and then can be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cutting, color, and intensities in the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read pictures and write images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masked better results than sharpening. this could be caused by this caused unsharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp masked must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the integrity filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese Filters is always at least as good as the impossible mask. the FIR Viennese filters is often better at machining of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">"the original unclear color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the car focus lens."</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods of sharpness problems in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English below that address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator glar sets the sharpness of the division of the division, in order to create a more natural pupil."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour ink allows a customized color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can set it here."</seg>

<seg id="517">"this tool contains different preferences, as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:"</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed description p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glass place over the image. a value of 0,9 should be so that no sharpening is needed. please note that the details will always be rearranged."</seg>
<seg id="520">"diagram dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly throughout all directions, while a value is close to 1 in one direction. if you have a film grazing or CCD noise, a high value of similar patterns will generate. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value as a degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned with larger structures. the higher this value is made, the more the geometry is above, because it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: are often going through the algorithm often. usually 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">"[5, 90]: angular integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen, it should also be small. be sure that small angles can generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral part distance [0,1, 10]: integral stride length of pixel. you should set the value lower 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing, and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the More quality which you receive by selecting this option is only low. but it doubles the run time. therefore we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading do exactly this. every setting of image error can be stored in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image error is comparatively very fast in work. however, it can still last long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demolition."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time of filters per pixel and can be ported by the radius and the color in it becomes smoothed and thus smaller bugs adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter. if it is increased, the adaptive filter will change. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can't get longer and smoke or lubrication."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the frequency response can be removed or catches can occur. put it at a value close to the maxim, if you want to remove a weak or JPEG artifacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerant of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the tolerance tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas, typically stronger than to increase. however, it also sharpened the shadow areas too."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of the phasenjitterdamping pressure. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear to appear, noise and phasenjitter may occur at the edges. it can remove noise and phasenjitter and is the recommended method."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for the noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later charged."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is coated with only a beam per pixel, different errors can be created. these images often have a Moirè pattern or Stuff effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing, to reduce the influence of these defects. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because each pixel is becoming increasingly divided and adaptive because each pixel can depend on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam per pixel. if you set the difference between the values to the neighbouring pixel, both pixels will be charged with the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 subtypes which can be followed individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn out jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with Kodierprograms, there is often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodiers explain the switch for these programs."</seg>

<seg id="1661">"in this section, as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that need to take this instrument on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard supports a drum (e.g. with tone 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which can be similar to a tissue in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so now, a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (Gun up), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant with each tone a different percussioning instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) is and not the one that means the sound-height of the same drum means that some keyboards (like him have keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how to be shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keypresses for each channel and you have to use different names only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to form tones on the percolon channel. take a look at the provided key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form a few channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, simply make it easy at CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on one particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, up following the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is part of the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will be defined by the name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the perforated patch on the permeate channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio gives, in which ratio of Pitch-Bender event will be multiplied. if so, a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event, then it will be rerelayed to this with the value n * (r / 4096) and then it will be redirected. the value 4096 is used, so that the map file will not be decimal (decimal point)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM presents that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch of a pitch of 4096, but try to play a tone higher with the value 4096. in order to find some keyboards up to one octave higher. in order to get the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a little bit with & kmid; try around."</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, and etc; this may lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same sheet in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can no need to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the single instruments, the speed & etc; they have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to solve the problem you need to download and install a source code (for example by kmid; 's home)"</seg>
