&quot; although I visited the USA at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily large .
&quot; how many of my generation I also grew up with American films , I joined American music , read American authors and operated his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound impact on me that I was working mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less reporter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who was the Supreme Court of Justice to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are , and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of par@@ ch@@ inn@@ ate people . &quot;
I even had a very warmer love writing about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded . &quot;
he never believes in his mind behind the mountain as you are so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague , and explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ american and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people re@@ acts on his testimony and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes cast at the Republi@@ can Presidential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the Party of nominated candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support those authenti@@ cated person I asked myself ?
&quot; I could not get Tr@@ ump and his voters in accordance with the people , which I met in Phoenix during my time . &quot;
&quot; like the example of my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , people from around the world , a deep believing man , with whom I was talking about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps agreed not to illustr@@ ate the world@@ view of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their lives in the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; still she fits with the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and my colleagues to acc@@ use us to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er has helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those by them em@@ bodies my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump on his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe due to its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ frontation with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they either were either rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke out almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair the b@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; one of my friends , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; that is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ tful , suggests a in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes will not be taken into account in their municipalities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most knows , are voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they would perhaps say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently than he looks . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; word @-@ game made of white into the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the big Van Jones , exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always like , America means everyone welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , its history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with complexity , religious freedom , and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again on the ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud voice , &quot; No ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the amount changed . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone , who doesn &apos;t like you , is a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was rec@@ tified . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean City Cat@@ e@@ ura have in common ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places is not only changing the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large land@@ fill , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; since a couple of years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of the children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome them . &quot;
a music school with 100 students have become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poorest provinces Mex@@ ic@@ os is known for its drugs mis@@ use and the Ban@@ den @-@ violence .
&quot; however , this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had offered a rare hop@@ el@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Emer@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; coming back and with shining eyes and play in the tur@@ mo@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recur@@ rent waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , made from local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez started to turn parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , double bass , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion made all of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local o@@ ist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , remember the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was somewhat shown , what he had never seen before : one from waste produced violin . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared materials and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance on :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and live by him are the trouble - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication happens within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to the joint use of Content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operating in Li@@ beri@@ an waters of illegal fishing , before it was seeking the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries have risen above accordingly , and slightly incl@@ ined to welcome a criminal law of this kind in its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the tum@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobi@@ lized the ship quickly against the ship . they refused to give one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing industry . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not managed to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia due to pill@@ age in the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects the criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had driven out the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we have eight countries that are li@@ bri@@ t and work together . they do exchange information and stand for each other where it is illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , absent because of it is extremely difficult . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to un@@ intenti@@ onally mis@@ emp@@ t existing laws , which are to be protected by certain habit@@ ats and species , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems cannot have a del@@ ic@@ ate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange any lists of existing licenses , news for susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea with satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in banned territories . also , such susp@@ icious driving routes also suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations can indicate whether the involved ships have a fish attack where they were on the road and possibly even if they were a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports , which means that the ships can &apos;t sell their charge . and that they may even be forced to use pen@@ alties as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a significant financial losses for the owners , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve &quot; , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a mountain company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $ 20 million to lost turnover , representing the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing plants , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing region around the world . among these also the same Il@@ legal Fischer . &quot;
&quot; among other things , actions include the sailing under false flag , fake license documents , indication of fant@@ as@@ en@@ ames , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you use the missing international cooperation and make up the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system , &quot; &quot; said long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You will not stop my port . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships . &quot;
it has been crimin@@ ating networks which have distributed licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found volatile ships and found .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for fighting crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far in the networks of organis@@ ational crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships more precise . &quot;

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system which is always developed and helps prevent illegal ships to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ legal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that we try to cross it , &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn their automatic identification systems , which they can &apos;t be used anymore by satellites . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which links various information . it should help F@@ ISH help to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world &apos;s position every single tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who doesn &apos;t make sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to join himself and join their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system appro@@ ve the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als but also deter them .
&quot; ships , which had been over@@ f@@ ished in earlier without license and had hardly to be seen with consequences , now they know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH countries have now seen a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , ever since fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board to@@ wing networks , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries notice these achievements . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear annually through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries gathered together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with safety is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was able to report its first major triumph in Somalia : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only the ship was on the way and were used to to@@ w @-@ gri@@ ds that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also involved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative work of the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to spread : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of turning the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government had denied the opposition to a referendum on a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations carried on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they assembled on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : Venezuela &apos;s return order ) can be found in pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be led in other parts of the country , among other things in the Fla@@ inas MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north centre Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , in everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans is noticeable by an acute deficiency of food and medicines . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the present president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro took the chance for a fundamental change ; but ultimately the re@@ jection of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of government decision in this context : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is among the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to give the chance to rec@@ la@@ ve its institutional structures and to join a new government nation . &quot;
&quot; the voting rights of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the protest@@ ant parties and political groups have joined forces to join the National Assembly , and a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government , on 3 November , should continue to continue blocking the refer@@ end@@ ums to be continued . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday , and on November 3 , all to Caracas to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the Action Program &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ riages , which are published in real time , testify among others an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with police officers and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
one of the most often divided images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the protection signs : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ?
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; she cri@@ es from the Vene@@ tians . &quot;

the news struck the news about police repression in the central @-@ north @-@ west town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they managed to leave the cathedral back , but the protests were continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some protest@@ ers tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts because you could see something that many nation@@ alities do not have !
&quot; meanwhile , an infection is already making the turn which constitutes the extent of oppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a post office procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Labs to include :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your ministry !
on the road !
&quot; other values have taken over these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken a little against the devastating economic crisis , and better to allow critical voices to be silent : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media that they are too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shop .

&quot; this is a adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was posted on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , a Argentin@@ ean news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said within the scope of the Great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in Cordoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined by crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano did not look for his life .
&quot; starting with the office , the same names as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not know that my father was a thief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ king . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was in prison in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities in the course of the years that he had experienced as a boy , and who testified against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and called me to identify my boy@@ friend . &quot;
he said :
you are a ass@@ hole you have friends with one of the ERP .
&quot; just wait , that they don &apos;t lead you one day , and I have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Democratic Party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore he charged me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later , he accepted me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
&quot; on the base point , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all possible documents : university degree , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ so the prisoners are tortured ...
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
&quot; on the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the car , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bit wrapped in a blanket , and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down and held me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he interpreted an open space and said :
the prisoners will be tortured .
&quot; I saw in , and saw a song , tortured in man . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that they attach it to an end of the cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person , which was right there . &quot;
&quot; they caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , ski@@ pped him with water and had a charge of 220 Volt in the gen@@ itali@@ a . &quot;

the rock there was horri@@ ble there ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much for another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father participated in the work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and used them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , an civilians who also was charged with the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , where naked people were bound with the face down , all were bound at hands and feet . &quot;
in the proximity of the en@@ chan@@ ted people still quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; as my father , I noticed that I saw to the prisoners , &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; why did you escape , why have you brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a dit@@ ch and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told her home .
next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former tor@@ rent chambers . &quot;
&quot; the road to which you came in here is also the way , where the kidn@@ apped here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of it came up that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for revival of people and disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that is fought against an enemy that you fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... steal , then this is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never be like to enter into a house , and steal everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I said , &quot; &quot; You who asc@@ end cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; when he explo@@ ded anger , he smote me , and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you walk so far , then I will find you and bring you an independent . &quot;
we don &apos;t need any other !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the trial , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father out of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a fellow worker with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay a burden to me what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to announce .
&apos; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older I am sensitive . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; it develops further , and recognizes that it is false to kill . &quot;
I even went to say so far :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ propri@@ ated during the dictatorship of man . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do you have ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a small girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it could not have been able to bring them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families who were able to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ous act that you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and destroyed somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; man will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , showing my father , was created during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest . &quot;
I made him repro@@ aches because of all of the atro@@ cities that I had to see him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , for what the whole bu@@ oy@@ ancy patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; they were supposed to defend , actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed horri@@ ble crimes , and you comp@@ elled me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed the first ad .
&quot; finally , I recognized that he was a criminal . &quot;
nobody can use me that I am vo@@ iced . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before end of the trial .
&quot; he was indicted for 416 crimes : including heavier , unlimited freedom of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a fall of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of child . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of the judgement .
&quot; after four years ago , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial concluded between March 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 supp@@ resses were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and sentenced to sentences in 28 cases of life sentences and nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases it was acqu@@ itt@@ al . &quot;
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ x : murder ; torture and rape due to officers . # Es@@ war@@ state terrorism
&quot; all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military members , former police officers and their civilian people . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have been working for victims for years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial took more than three years , but the research took for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government handed over the country to La Per@@ la where a memorial was established there , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

an translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ less drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in the Kyoto center in which you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which you can extend its driver &apos;s licence in the last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word , which means &quot; older drivers , &quot; means that &quot; older drivers &quot; means , perhaps - maybe even with ar@@ gues back &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; the &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; was translated . &quot;
&quot; the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area , and to read in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; the work of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the K@@ YO@@ TO Shim@@ bu@@ n writes in the K@@ YO@@ TO :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the correct English translation was initially removed , and the term &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ fecture accounted for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by the translator and that the translation was not tested on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news release J @-@ cast News continued with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who have been involved in accidents , but quite an occasion to worry . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by senior citizens in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the elderly caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has declined in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period increased . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ eless reporter , published in Yahoo , published comments on the light that show pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors was given the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; In@@ correct is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error .
there are not a few comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure pit for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread circulation of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to Survi@@ ve , one requires two major skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and transfer language skills to transmit it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active rule of target language - something that is in the case of matern@@ ity . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the language language - Mother &apos;s language . &quot;
a French native speakers should translate into English for example from English to French - not from the French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue which could provide translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign employees , let translations make them fir@@ med internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best to interpre@@ ter - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also common - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ens and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases which are created by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace long any human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for temporary reasons - not to be read or not understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless or at least harmless . but of great companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the K@@ YO@@ TO is in the future hopefully a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : take the Internet and Television on Internet and Television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y S@@ oc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an internet use that they have no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are also not access@@ able anymore .
&quot; other online channels also carried out photos of the protests in Caracas , organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that contradi@@ ct the Government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court has dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is s@@ app@@ alled , and recommended users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezuel@@ an providers are locked again .
that is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 traditional media are hes@@ itated on the coverage of protests . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations imposed them with fin@@ es and fin@@ ances when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call to force . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I applied myself again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
surprisingly that it is more favorable than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro confirmed that it was not only Viv@@ op@@ lay through a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two additional online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings . &quot;
&quot; former research institute of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet providers can also use DNA . this is a technique due to the DNS server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers correctly or refused the request of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ eventh oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera was Elvis Flo@@ res who carried out the protests in Caracas . &quot;
Flo@@ res was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans will continue to have access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls are getting too slave to preserve an apprenticeship . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ land .
&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a brief report published by Global Vo@@ ices , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , exp@@ iry Schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family that lived there . &quot;
&quot; just before her degree in the university , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house were full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas one described more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money over their min@@ ors son , or her min@@ ors daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned above is that the children can afford a number of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a contract that you can &apos;t lift up . &quot;
&quot; as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testimony , calculated and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated to Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general no silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who close her daughter in the belief that they conclude with her education , improve their position in society and can make something out of themselves , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl with himself and its exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that they would give someone a chance that would not be any education , and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon which took place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households has been taking place , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of heavy stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; it was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military belonging to Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer in the residential community . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira suggested long as long as a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported the incident .
they emphas@@ ize that the murdered child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela did the deeply ro@@ oted practice in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there was no further Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; lam@@ ented Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a further investigation of the case .
&quot; they want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n will be a case for the first time in the history of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before the Court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labor force , they live well insulated by other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers , now , had to work all work and started to sell money on the road or on the market of sweets . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was working between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still remained time to learning . &quot;
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , they cleaned the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more time she was done with learning , the more leisure had it . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial of opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; to read . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator of dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he maintained them for intelligent , but did not hold her with her . &quot; the house@@ er@@ r had found someone who spoke , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there again &quot; bad habits &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would return home their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that she was able to lose her , that she would lose . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ minated in school . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans of whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I could not invite anyone home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the period where friends arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job positions for cleaning personnel and kinder@@ ties in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town council in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;

bill writes Egyptian users social media to register in the government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed a bill to &quot; regul@@ ators regarding the use of usage and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a position would be set up in order to communicate social media citizens . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register users with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be missed to do this , so that could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and is defined in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is going on the Internet and used to communicate with other using voice , video files and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is assumed , as the design is not given a hint on how Egyptian authorities are not to register the user within and in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary report and pat@@ rons of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and a password &quot; to get a user name and a password &quot; by the fire@@ wall to be blocked by the fire@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; that could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary to submit information about their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans consist .
experts and experts are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt , regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical and private rooms , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens to resolve the approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a court . &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees , before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the design &quot; is in accordance with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in whose senses are maxim@@ ized and ensured that no other nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Parliament , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ Ã¯@@ y , proposed a legislative proposal against Cy@@ ber crime , which was due for a life imprisonment for those who were found guilty to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and to protest &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kurdistan &apos;s Kurdistan in the Nor@@ theast of Iraq work the animal protection H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza , and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the ster@@ ile Persian Leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards created by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are always at risk of care , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat . &quot;
why is this certain type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the increase of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild , is low and goes against zero . when the team is in the video that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented in the Nor@@ theast Japan @-@ daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to revi@@ ve the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; Thir@@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , who had to experience the earthquake and the tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring countries of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ishing all coastal cities of the map .
&quot; in addition , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture continued to have a nuclear accident , because of that , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows that progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of the local authorities .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
&quot; residential building in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement parts ( range of mon@@ g , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could be recorded , 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by accommodation , Ev@@ aku@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u has lived in a final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple @-@ cat@@ astrop@@ hic catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima evacu@@ ated from Fukushima live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated which were moved to the disaster in accommodation they were transferred to final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by the disaster had opened their doors to December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries ports have been re @-@ recorded in Fukushima . &quot;
tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident have moved to the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , where only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land could be used in Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that it is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fukushima , are located in the nuclear pl@@ itude zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has continued to recover far back , but Fukushima left off here . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent in the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fukushima , however , only 75 percent are possible . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that almost half of the coastal inhabitants have almost half of the coastal inhabitants of making it harder to earn their living . &quot;
is the indigenous people prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a complete picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ation . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also , as you find emp@@ athy for the tsun@@ ami @-@ risk . &quot;
in its introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami @-@ consciousness under the native population .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident population , which have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disasters of disasters has been done . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture , &quot;
&quot; in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increased its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ate from Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; Fukushima still had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic accident , nuclear accident involving Japan ever had to be experienced . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 Ev@@ aku@@ ed from Fukushima , nearly 63 000 people were re@@ located in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people were transferred back to Fukushima , in permanent replacement parts . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 status , 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home country . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hes , most of the evacu@@ ates , which are still in accommodation accommodations , are older than 50 years old . it is known because efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima with massive construction projects . here it concerns construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one meets people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the common@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more links more than it seems to be at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , extending our perspectives and remind us that the world finally is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep po@@ d@@ cast , we will deal with topics that often get less attention when reporting . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .

doctors operated him this Saturday and have put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , also the vision of the police officers to recognize that was identified with a stroke stock . the man was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the closing of the investigation of the active service was suspended . &quot;

&quot; would be a police officer by demonstr@@ ators and land on the intensive care station , would be to see his face for six months in television and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of Media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , which one sees as Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officers and several sanitary short to him . &quot;

&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ lians ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is at the hospital . &quot;

police over@@ handles
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only State in Brazil in which it came to protest@@ ers last Friday at brutal police officers .
&quot; polic@@ emen were set up in protests in central Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , g@@ ums and lac@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is also a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media pros@@ thes@@ es once again have the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted on a frag@@ ile glass windows in order to illustr@@ ate their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title with a brand @-@ set sail . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disk than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; you must also recognize , if one is stri@@ ct against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , consistent importance , and the typical violence of the military police have failed by headlines with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the discovery of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar tubes were included in Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a el Central - Spanish sugar mill - regardless of which there is no significant sugar crop on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar tubes were l@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; after awakening the sugar ro@@ ar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete was left . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
&quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which still grin@@ d . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a solo@@ ist veter@@ an , which stands every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , does not smoke the crisis in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are in operation in the east of sugar cane factories , which have been operational after a long in@@ active time , because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar ro@@ hr@@ ines , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar @-@ tube industry has already resistance to pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ iciency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the country for some decades , but the poor harv@@ ests are already no more bl@@ iss . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off ?
the old platform of the municipality saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : 155 sugar tubes were technically out@@ dated and barely competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for most of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ ves , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the assur@@ ances on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price dropped below a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today , the day of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro declared the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar ro@@ ar mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the Su@@ gar fabrik Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word that he is most repeated , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents have the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first calendar year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially declared documents that would be removed only regarding parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date distinguished . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to take any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed and the letters were increasingly frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for two years for the shut @-@ off factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , &quot; he insured for operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the breast@@ feeding of the factory at whose construction , he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace generators was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories had no longer work in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar met@@ ering factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by mapping . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the Su@@ gar Factory closed , or better , when they began to un@@ lock it , they listened to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to find other factories . &quot;
they became a spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , which production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
&quot; by the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty hits the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month , in order to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a tra@@ geous person , yet he told the lies that one told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene comes with 65 years in retirement , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bitter . &quot;

young people of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . do they do with Hip @-@ Hop thanks to a number of touring workshops .
&quot; since 2014 , workshops as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour have been bringing together mobile electronic studio directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will achieve that the young participation in talks on issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever it comes to sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; as the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &quot; Yo@@ o in the area of the area of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ o Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to conv@@ ey how important to preserve traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , even though the young@@ sters do not always rule the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ Side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in a tran@@ script , as well as translation into English , translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like anyone else would be interested in me
&quot; but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on earth , &quot;
&quot; that is the day , where you will take our cry &quot;
because we lost our way to life in our lives
&quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
&quot; so , they can grow and proceed as well as our youth . &quot;
&quot; so you can do that , for what they determined the Creator &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are exhibited in close proximity to the entrance of the &quot; &quot; Plastic &quot; &quot; section , &quot; Plast@@ ics models of dishes &quot; ) from any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers will see this plastic dishes at and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to manufacturing this plastic dishes .
&quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a multitude of these small companies that manufacture the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usual that they do not even need them more . however , a new trend is transformed into current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Nav@@ al Mat@@ omas , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ck@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now on sale : new with plastic dishes made decor@@ ate mobile phone belts as they are shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ ten collection objects , as in this case , fri@@ dges mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ no@@ ises is becoming increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone support .
for these tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
&quot; also , this part was made for the Tokyo Station . &quot;
and here is an apple which holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phone support and mobile @-@ designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon were che@@ ated , a popular p@@ opping which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can betra@@ y my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ ary form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone support has the form of mel@@ anch@@ oly .
&quot; furthermore , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand bands made of dried sweet salmon . &quot;

a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of fighting against the organized crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; in reports domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico , the missing and ge@@ aring regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that brings this battle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Car@@ ells , urged the stories of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the dream or commun@@ es who have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone re@@ funds in the hundreds of bones , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds perhaps never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traff@@ icking to live &quot; ) that this victims will give a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between prosecution and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project :
organis@@ ational crimes does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the imp@@ lications are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and to buy lots of kilometers in order to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear@@ ful life changed &quot; ) exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches for every weekend secret graves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who only lost their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ phe@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves on the task that we have placed ourselves , let go and go to the graves after the people who we loved to look for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should return again , but he never returned . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; my mother , too , is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you have the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but it does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; will explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to demonstrate the faces of those who oppos@@ e themselves . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leaders . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader from Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; her contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
&quot; now , I &apos;ve been aware of the disease and sens@@ orial journ@@ alism for several years now . &quot;
&quot; I am coming every day to newspaper c@@ ti@@ des over and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or ac@@ ies of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or considered normal as normal .
she continues :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic drugs &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear they have something like that . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories to blo@@ b numbers are in statistics . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ action of man is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were . &quot;
&quot; I think they try to try out that they conce@@ aled from such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t stir and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four Mon@@ ths Re@@ furb@@ ishment in the main city District : &quot; as a family with threats of threats , it describes how armed criminal month was destroyed by their business until they did not only spend their business apart , but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again , when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers . &quot;
&quot; we only contact us , if it is absolutely necessary . &quot;
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they are running or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wine would dissolve my profound feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the &quot; &quot; forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez , &quot; a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he himself had to teach himself , how to make a egg , potatoes , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; however , they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and to learn to live thereby . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood already past two years ago , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a pass car . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , as power by the organized crime and the struggle against the social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders in public security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secution counted 3@@ 103 murders . this corresponds to average 8.5 murders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul &apos;s soul . &quot;
&quot; few stories still live in view of a new headlines , but this project reminds us of those who we cannot forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking that has tortured the country in the past four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages , to which it is left , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fac@@ simile check is important in a moment , in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or to de@@ file a rum@@ or . &quot;
&quot; but how is this for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tend to continue . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies to im@@ itate trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false cl@@ utch of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa was negle@@ cted in the second largest country for years and caused the streets in the region became dangerous paths of impact , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to the tank . &quot;
&quot; there was a fire@@ ball as described by a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people , that were full of the soccer world championship . &quot;
houses gross and wi@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ ere photos of the incident make the grey scenes of this day . &quot;
up is an example .
it shows a wi@@ red body which blocks on the ground while people are looking at .
but here the story does not find her end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been refresh@@ ed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but may not be attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , milit@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the horri@@ fied Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
ophthalm@@ ologists reported dra@@ stically from atro@@ cities to whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and prayers .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; said one inhabitants on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army officer in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture of the DR Congo re@@ appeared as evidence of the fact and the potential of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ using use of the DR Congo is only one in a number of patches with patches ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; another step further bring personal comments , such as the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture of San@@ ge came in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , those are published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on which these descriptions were merged with photos from DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page which had said in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ a being said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to obtain this information . &quot;
&quot; the original entry , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , which they called AFP as their source , had likewise attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but did not allow the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false data
&quot; traces of this wrong cav@@ ities submit to the years 2011 and 2012 , they actually come across all over the world . &quot;
&quot; using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far more information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; a reverse image search with the search engine of Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the discussed image of the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixer , private sites , platforms social media and common publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have false reports for@@ warded , and others have attempted to expos@@ e the counter@@ f@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; we brought examples to the ab@@ using use and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on which side they were published . therefore , we want to display the range more clearly than by language . &quot;
several examples of ab@@ using used countries can also come from the listed countries ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) .
here are some cases which can now be completely divided ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
demonstration examples of false co @-@ coupl@@ ings of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ related countries refer to sites or servers , which are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also fake examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed in Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an said in 2012 , that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge . &quot;

&quot; the picture was wi@@ red as a cover for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and over 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were connected with it were not taken into any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( English ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message was written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , discussion forums like this was here on Vietnam and declared it to the counterfeit error . &quot;
&quot; from the message that included the image from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dist@@ ressed . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , ag@@ gregate and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye shows also not fully re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and isolated they have a picture in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture has ultimately been a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) , which passes these po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on Religion . &quot;
the photo was used in terms of major discussions on the silence in connection with the murdered Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming is used to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this picture longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are funny people who have un@@ intended to have the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ars the mood of false and fal@@ se@@ hood , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of non@@ violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is , that the rec@@ ting of images of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures reader and audience si@@ zing them and the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , who sought how violent media are trying to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some more for@@ cible represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will thoroughly investigate the situation in which a picture can be sug@@ ars in the context or completely mis@@ used type . &quot;
a study of false enco@@ ders should also take into account as internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ mistak@@ ably ) tried to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that is difficult or not to be translated .
&quot; such words are available in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , often very complex or specific . &quot;
&quot; some of these un@@ readable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ dic ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ lic@@ esa ) . &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly in any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes somewhat context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists are Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s VAT language as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - dimension@@ ing you for your parents in recognition of it , as you have tried for your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth@@ fulness that you feel after you felt in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they s@@ nar@@ es other cultures , reveal other thoughts , and make our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , as we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , they would like to publish more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are possible . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to invite their favorite words here . &quot;

&quot; as Sri Lanka , with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade &quot;
the island of Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , usually ending in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped on the shore . &quot;
&quot; after a statement by the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missed due to floods and s@@ lu@@ dges . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stays .
&quot; the rainfall left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the floods in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still intact areas .
the following pictures and videos tell a impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to high water conditions .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly sins ham@@ mer@@ ed the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ in crisis , save the Children , after further rainfall are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded with the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a river . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for life actions and another five are made ready for transport of emergency deliveries in their flooded villages .
various organisations and start @-@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water conditions and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
&quot; the taxi @-@ created app Pic@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; high water aid &quot; button , which allowed it to pick up a vehicle to pick up hel@@ pers and donations . they were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ische Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; as well , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which included more than thousands of inquiries and 150 successful bo@@ aters for high water and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the agreed efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms will be fully exhausted , bring residents in need in need of security and help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now im@@ min@@ ent as long as restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; in the next channels , we add rights to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others add slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things are not related to you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not the Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have met me for years , separ@@ ating me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; which was built in their performance . &quot;
they are mus@@ cul@@ ated me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different ways . but somehow we all set in the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective not@@ ion that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit them there , are mus@@ cul@@ ated . &quot;
how to become mus@@ cul@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet that poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in mind when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as a Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old , as I am now , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western presentation , religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as the most popular translation of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; another is in the reductions of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ised by Western books for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man who should fear , and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;

I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ r@@ ative of our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women shall be hin@@ dered to wear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and cover Saudi women by their government to cover their entire body , this is both two sides of the same medal . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group pract@@ ised his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ vely weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
&quot; it looks over that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought to this way with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has been occupied deeply and in@@ correct , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are att@@ ested to target an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ ary attacks and scra@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;

in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .

I think we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ y@@ ans with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and inter@@ religious activists who stri@@ ve to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with money @-@ makers , think tanks and experts for fal@@ se@@ hood , which is already a faulty image of what a Muslim is ; or of which Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , when I was four years old , a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they claim to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may be not always visible , but they are here . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my beloved in the bran@@ ching see that I am Muslim , if it could look at the 15 @-@ meter concrete and air that could separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the full @-@ evening rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept it in my arms , and you see the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; therefore , I ask that she is protected from evil , evil that you can see and evil that you can &apos;t see . &quot;
my Muslim faith may not always be visible but my Muslim faith is always part of my shadow .

&quot; it is the picture of you that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be almost exclusively complex . &quot;
&quot; Muslim means to say the prayers that she had said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslim , as she taught me , has taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; which was founded by a &quot; empire &quot; which has founded a company with the name of honour@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ que Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a depth of meaning to call my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart by my grandfather , from colon@@ ists , who have shared the Muslim world like the game risk . &quot;
&quot; Muslim means to know that in the past two centuries , Europeans have all colon@@ ised all by four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was subjected to a Muslim country in the history of a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time , the Grand@@ father of my grandmother , a Indian , native @-@ subject of the British Empire , led by the newspapers its time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;

&quot; it means to remind that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed over every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , had to pursue mass destruction of weapons that were not existing . &quot;
it means to know more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
&quot; an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate under veter@@ ans has risen by over 32 percent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy the US is home and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is recorded four times more than a story with a white attacks . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;

initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to preserve urban knowledge diversity
&quot; tell by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the licence CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone else in connection ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) the acquisition of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ mistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; mass mortality of the world may be avoided , when we create towns , accept di@@ vers@@ ities - secure spaces in which inhabitants are not to be forgotten , who they are to be da@@ zz@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; during &quot; listen , often it is connected to understand &quot; to understand these events instead of &quot; listening to feel , to feel &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their history first in their own language and transl@@ ating or explain it into English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and their representation make sure that the listeners . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story out of Burkina Faso which is told in the language d@@ af@@ ing . during this lap , the stor@@ yt@@ elling R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou outlines the opportunity to explain their country &apos;s typical customs of art . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ able from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the ca@@ vi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; when he asked the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide ridge he shares his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity : &quot;
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; to date , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;

&quot; the people of Puerto R@@ os demands that politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for debts , are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and an governance committee without personal interests to the public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration , which ag@@ ates in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state of integrated territory of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state view . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .

&quot; the Syrian Palestinian web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he has provided for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is aimed at Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French national CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive index ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of par@@ agra@@ phs that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is called : &quot;
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are , with whom it is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who have participated in the movements for freedom of freedom , have worked on page to look over the fog that gives our news feeds and to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ claimed Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice , p@@ ushing him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ ely extreme belie@@ fs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer of open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; recorded command of the military tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; on 12 November 2015 , G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they were contacted by persons himself as an Insider of the Assad government and conf@@ essed them from an alleged death part against her husband . &quot;
his stay and state remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge about the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently directed the ladder from New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps there was none of P@@ asha &apos;s cultural prototypes , as the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ point of numerous civilians and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ome traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would have all about it , that architecture not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip is created in digital archae@@ ology and preser@@ vation has created a period of time , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public and for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel was able to un@@ lock this project until now . &quot;
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in jail :
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other things to read , write and speak to speak . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught others to others , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they really thought one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book a year .
she tells the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English .
the book is licensed free .
book cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happening &quot; :
&quot; in every visit , it is happening &quot;
&quot; that I sin@@ king in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; in the moment , that I left Bes@@ ides in the moment , in which we embrace us , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers is no matter , &quot;
&quot; any of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I push in every detail of your voice and words .
&quot; I bear with passion for me , &quot;
if your eyes say void
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to get all the moments , &quot;
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I testify about myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
while they are
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
bass &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of protests against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption convicted director after Dis@@ claim@@ er again pre@@ dict@@ ated post
&quot; Muslims responded to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money originated from public schol@@ ars of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice Cam@@ b@@ aza , between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and called immediately his re @-@ setting to the company which was then on 19 April then .
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the general prosecutor , the Republic of the Republic that evalu@@ ates the motion , there would be no obst@@ acle @-@ reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , as the company did not settle any discipl@@ ines after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision to put the company again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates this lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to know is that the company should have to lead an discipl@@ ines against the contra@@ dicts .
&quot; however , the company was silent , however , no appropriate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ ence social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , it would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had to eat . &quot;
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
&quot; but as he is competent , he has joined the company to be re@@ integrated into the company who helped avoid damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
resi@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he has insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone has been rewarded with such a way that has already condemned the state so strongly . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als to serve the mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead has served themselves on the state only . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was used the state , as hand@@ leb@@ ars used to become an in@@ exhau@@ stible cash source and the state itself is that man fain@@ ted , who was re@@ charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a thief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves are part of the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , which will not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , bl@@ ending and - by speaking - prophe@@ tic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the fath@@ er@@ land for its amb@@ itions , to sell its own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know whether a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he doesn &apos;t change his amb@@ itions . &quot;
&quot; a ambitious man , at the same time , is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also le@@ aning : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it sets the company , with whom he promised money again , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Con@@ gres@@ sor ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored for many users
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age @-@ sis .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to as@@ sign people of eastern Indian origin or generally as an ad@@ jec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
&quot; in recent years , the A@@ scen@@ sion has given an extremely valuable con@@ notation to the word . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism in connection , but the word itself calls not automatically to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they also discussed the use of the word , or have doubts about the use of the word , cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese even &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( chim@@ ney ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
&quot; a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the Word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they could cry out how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by doing a word . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( u ) + the question@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will reduce hated language radical nation@@ alists , and also emphas@@ ized that Facebook needs to be analy@@ tic that Facebook needs to be dis@@ semin@@ ated in sus@@ pic@@ ion in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ ing ook .
&quot; what to do instead , the post is carefully analy@@ sing and check it by checking the words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ ect@@ ins ) .
&quot; the good thing is that these three nation@@ alists who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate language , receive a rather good lesson . &quot;
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat , have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship of percussion is often a cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users can use social networks just to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I got att@@ enti@@ vely carefully to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail from Facebook was removed and me , the li@@ ken , post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not say . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts from humans , who have no negative int@@ entions , or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech radical nation@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alism are bad in the country .
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
Facebook likes a welfare int@@ ent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform but it does not work .
such words to cen@@ time will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; it also appears as if they have begun without local context or technical support , and as words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; her@@ ed@@ cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not temp@@ t to correct po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefit they had a large turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has made a lot of mo@@ ckery for a lot of mo@@ ckery .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now consider using Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see if their posts will be taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which were not contained in Hass@@ elt , but still removed : &quot;
with permission is used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ ed@@ cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook contains the mail , which contains the Word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation in social networks should also use violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was for his failure , the bal@@ ances of hate speech on his bur@@ ial sites under control , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; but rather than using the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running in context than in context of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
&quot; in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago , Tob@@ ago is the end of children &quot;
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country of the country unanimously decided a law to offer this practice , so that the age of marriage is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this amendment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es , some members participated in du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered together that the state should not inter@@ fere with the country , as the one , the old age did not get the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has defined a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors of people under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ itions and social media movements that stri@@ ves to abol@@ ish laws for children , followed by the foot , and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , Hin@@ du leaders , for example , had no concerns to say the criticism of children before they should say goodbye to their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition campa@@ igned for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime came doubts , whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child &apos;s before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed , so that it could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators sent a status update which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against children before being decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them decided against it . &quot;
&quot; after being decided in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws have been finally changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede , which has lost the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s before is worth every price in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought , it was definitely long enough to leave the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ happy that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent News ! &quot;
the sp@@ ouses has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society , which openly openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years old .
&quot; today , on 9 June 2017 , the amendment to the Am@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ etz@@ etz@@ er was decided on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were against the law , voted for the law . &quot;
the child &apos;s before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ ei .
&quot; many thanks to all the activists who have taken him out . &quot;

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ i D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the general prosecutor Paris Al @-@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it is quite legally if Mahar@@ aj was going forward against the law , most social media users would not wish to go the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Vor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that only panic and inno@@ m@@ wood may cause that it may be assured that the state will protect our daughters , that they may be mis@@ use of great , hard @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ed men who are opposed to them in the advantage , would you be willing to carry the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a court appearance against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations legal or continue the norm , even though there is laws that they do . &quot;

&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform is based on all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator ) , which does not make a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is un@@ il@@ able despite the law . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ c post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on it , snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dest@@ org website .
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ sti@@ an Cons@@ onn@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as also Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to ho@@ stage similar Mir@@ ror@@ sides if closed in the country Wikipedia . &quot;
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and employee at Mozilla at Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
you can attack a different URL that is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially the server runs the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ful moti@@ fs and washed colors . &quot;
&quot; the motivated him to carry him a camera , and try to gra@@ ce@@ ve the situation . &quot;
then he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ als are trying to bring to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland is right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ders the attention on Nep@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , he described this first @-@ class location with his work : &quot;
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park to a world natural heritage . what could it better give for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just rested at home when Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) suddenly called me . he had a call from my father that it would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the sho@@ res of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist village Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to kne@@ ading pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar dispute a collaboration with authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , for he was standing before face to face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late evening . light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also because of darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ avi@@ k appeared . he immediately sets us , we &apos;ll see and start me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals placed Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cks for environmental protection ) on its photos .
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of the Bar@@ dia National Park footage of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , which live near the tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , there are women with greatest care , the name of their husbands , or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect their husband because of the social pressure to dis@@ respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ sc@@ a by a p@@ seu@@ dost@@ ems and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives . &quot;
&quot; the tradition also must not call their wives by name , but is also common in men . however , they have far less conditions to be feared if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; nine women , among them healthcare professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club , came quickly into the village of Pun@@ e in Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , and so quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place for them alone , in which they discuss the host@@ esses of Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which there is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and establishes itself for the removal of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years , with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era , such as children &apos;s holy and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages these clubs . &quot;
it reports about how this club created a safe place for this women and made it simultaneously to amb@@ ass@@ adors of the mur@@ al .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini in their discussion round , did not use women who don &apos;t call their husbands at their name . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , with which the women can easily identify themselves . &quot;
&quot; according to the name of their husbands , a brilli@@ ance that they will not be found guilty and never put in question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition bears witness that a woman is respec@@ tful her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t last , is regarded as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought about this discussion until this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never been named after her husband , who has never been named at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were still silent after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; according to the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we could not say the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want us to respect ourselves ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on the lips , says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women have never allowed the name of their husbands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise just turned away , and another decided to allow all the fru@@ stration against him and his family by rele@@ asing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ exchange too , with an ancient spectac@@ le , women decided that they would actually try their husbands at home to call their husbands at their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in her head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; her mother @-@ in @-@ law , she was afraid , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation occurred in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the interest of interest on the forehead , which shows the marriage status : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot when he was doing it . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed only , and I listened to wear it . &quot;
&quot; the other women have not ceased to have stopped , but my , they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to carry him on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we do a trip with each discussion club .
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women , who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated her own birth@@ days in her life with cakes , they d@@ anced and sang talking about things that they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; for so many years I have been working on these problems and yet I have made some things , for example , how our ident@@ ities are linked to our husbands , never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things to say lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we have talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only been killed in Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ami @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast inhibit@@ or over a tro@@ users ; they have not we@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing @-@ selection , the mor@@ ality linked to Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ ori@@ ed Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion lap so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a at which they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to make it possible . &quot;
&quot; to the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion sk@@ lu@@ b has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have made only little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some of me included , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their forehead .
the women in the discussion lu@@ b know that the changes that they want to achieve in their life - like the line of freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us the confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman in the club goes home and other people told what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ dealers , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , presumably the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called a series of operations into life to stop the intern . &quot;
&quot; three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs were taken .
&quot; two men were arrested , and in the consequence , they stood that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;
&quot; it gives the local super@@ st@@ itions that the head of a glorious man of gold , who can bring wealth or riches , declared the pol@@ itic of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks have been registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , which is the target of ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 led to a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government &apos;s campaign developed to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who prefer to travel into the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are travelling to Mozambique are the goal of rit@@ ual attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ ence police after the latest dis@@ ables by three great @-@ member men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the murdered were arrested . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ urban in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already passed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the Sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of the glorious men .
&quot; the persecution and assassination of gl@@ am@@ orous individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , in the province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , is believed to have the police of the Republic of Mozambique into bet@@ ting ( PR@@ M ) that would also exist that a faith would have existed , according to which the victims in the head might have their wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the Chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers poor S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , who noted that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty to which Mozambique is oppos@@ ing : &quot;
&quot; I want to be GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , DAS S@@ ICH sh@@ amed One country where the teachers would like to go sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os might be hun@@ ted or even a man @-@ member for super@@ st@@ ating purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;

&quot; free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Issu@@ e , December 2012 ( in English ) new reactions of international community for medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably made it recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had taken attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( stat@@ e@@ dangerous ) , after being involved in the draft of Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; he told it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , fre@@ eing or permit a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely eradi@@ cated . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; poin@@ ter R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Liu . &quot;
&quot; however , one speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should practice pressure to allow Liu as a treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ inging have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into the impact after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government assured that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued to continue in December last year . only in June Norway , Norway signed an agreement in order to re@@ record the salmon crew to China , since 2010 exports have been largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the message that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought up his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to receive his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China in addition to the release of Li@@ us , as she divided in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all the visits and be able to communicate them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; US Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in@@ as if it is concerned with his satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; speaking of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy release the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu , but also fre@@ eing his wife Liu X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the statement by the US Embassy moved with a fur@@ ious answer from China , following the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to agree on an un@@ reasonable and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel bud@@ dies and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have introduced a resolution in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push for Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , according to that Liu &apos;s &quot; all the medical support will be needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns , whether the Wir@@ bel might over@@ take the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked to provide an appropriate medical care to provide an appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to provide himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AFP earlier that Li@@ us woman , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
&quot; Canada calls for China to uph@@ old its international human rights issues , including freedom of expression , true and exemp@@ t for the exercise of this rights . &quot;
France - France
&quot; France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China in a statement on 29 June , for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments which he needs , regardless where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family have to contact him . &quot;
&quot; even though the message of France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Foreign Ministry announced that France would not receive any further information if France would eventually receive him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Party of Party in Taiwan called for China on 27 June to release Liu , and to show greater tolerance towards those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature called &quot; &quot; Yu @-@ n@@ u &quot; by the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , in China , urged China to allow the sick of intellec@@ tuals to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed a very worried about Liu in a statement on June 28 to pray for Li@@ us well to pray for Li@@ us . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been strictly punished , led to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and wealthy China , which again contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and concerned citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state in Singapore .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the state Association of New York , the Minister said that many people are crit@@ ici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody stated in question whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that is , whereby most people have a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and offerings , this valuable land has to be created , you will say that we eventually have no country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory breach . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which , he appeared un@@ even un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanent from a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as you reach the key point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re from the author@@ itarian mach@@ in@@ ers appear to be present Democrats , leaving logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final effect the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mut@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he asked the appropriate questions with non @-@ responses r@@ ational art .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our advert@@ ised K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it was paid to be high , in order to be part of the government &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog , he publishes his comment on the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire install@@ ment of the conference , so that one might understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the testim@@ oni@@ als .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore will be so un@@ important , even if we are looking forward free and righteous elections . &quot;
he hired Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities witnessed such a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an reveals his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mut@@ gam as leader of a her@@ ent @-@ growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice had said in Singapore , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev and the members of the old Guard , which awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mut@@ gam , a member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leader , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mut@@ gam has a mistake , or was it a free mistake ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique and it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role in the inter@@ act of government , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people serve their military service , but they defend their city only ? &quot;
who needs to pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ mation , Singapore , and was always a town : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have a lot of people to be anno@@ yed ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear , like &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ ver@@ ted aspect at your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the report about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I reply . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation is taking place , it is considered a pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partners by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; the default answers then follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in mind before anger when they are held for Americans , but doesn &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that diff@@ ers us from Americans from Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible at their back@@ pack , if they travel . &quot;
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was even when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the march in Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons in us !
gay marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; everybody seems to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red . &quot;
it would make me no account when Johnny Dallas would be confused as an example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; firstly , as &quot; nice &quot; is called &quot; kind , &quot; means to be sp@@ icious - like the gut@@ ted , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; does not have personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
harmless to be harmless and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and not to deserve attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even say so far , to say that the desire , free and to be alone , is a prime minister of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of care of our own affairs .
&quot; what exterior is called &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk often over the fence with the neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage in order to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has just made Canada straight .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video published in Thailand has released a music video that seized the jun@@ ta in 2014 , and in spite of their promises to restore civilian government in 2014 . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which regulations makes his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the band was praised by many fans and other websites for their courage , to describe the situation of the country . &quot;
the video for song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook uploaded to 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month , Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it stands out with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; once again , look at these images of the video , which relate to some of the political topics involved in Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which is given the Commander in Chief of the He@@ eres of absolute decision @-@ making important national topics . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ation change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other people who are considered a critic by the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to rep@@ utable activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , monitored by the online content and people accused of having s@@ lan@@ ders the monarchy and prosec@@ uted the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is a strict use of &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta is still persecuted , its decision is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security per@@ missions are warning that the purchase is un@@ necessarily and a waste of tax ev@@ asion . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery v@@ ans before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and they are accused of pen@@ alties , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the Songs members of the band , who cited the sal@@ ut from &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute von Pan@@ em &quot; , &quot; which was already used by p@@ utsch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company is re@@ covering very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ili@@ an War was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked for Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also known as a ghost town in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here . today there are only a few hundred people in this ghost town . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; this is a result of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ t@@ schu@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ endor buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and resi@@ sted their contribution to the central economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas that can host one or two families , one recognizes in the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has banned us , that we let us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her friend and suddenly leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence sector ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to come about the laps .
&quot; in the winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman moved to Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina won &apos;t leave Gal@@ ina to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she instead supports their young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells her that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears in the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
I have prepared the ground already .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to all &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talk partner Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day she rec@@ alls the village in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , living in Central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children for each child .
her husband works in the carbon@@ at@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as nursery was once found , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ aps and chickens . &quot;
&quot; she tells us that it was first a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
&quot; but in the course of time , she lost her fears . &quot;

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark street , or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to all .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , however , has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly work and all lived like it was right .
&quot; every day , I remember like the city and the war once were . &quot;
&quot; as our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy separates us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball is flying from the window and another young ch@@ ases it back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which leaves the hill . &quot;
a group of children now pursu@@ it the ball .
&quot; while running , some of them throw stones at the falling buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , who ensure un@@ circumcision in their lives . &quot;

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border of Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin with a small woman with a cor@@ related pink spectac@@ le and golden @-@ colored ear@@ rings in a ted@@ dy bear form .
&quot; she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans that are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 Dollar per night , guests can sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it &apos;s rather quiet , but in this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard . &quot;
she would not reject anybody .
&quot; they also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buys medications they are not able to pay them out with a bal@@ m that in@@ exhau@@ sts from long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to get her husband and her three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans which are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other directions by Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; it tells us that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often go to travel together , and that , the Afri@@ cans speak to What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ stu@@ et to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he answered smile . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that their guests are often sending text messages when they went to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey .
it declares that their Christian faith is the drive of its work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught , chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez may be very well known here but it is not the only spar@@ ks of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
the other end of the city leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family has recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ chan@@ ets are sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for one dollar night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mostly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets at the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests can do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they &apos;re experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was referred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;

China : X@@ in@@ jiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter @-@ Us@@ ers , consisting of : &quot;
&quot; the residents of X@@ in@@ jiang , ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the phone users in Tian@@ shan district received the Ur@@ um@@ qi town of Ur@@ um@@ qi , in which they re@@ iter@@ ate the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; will hin@@ der you access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women have been arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they were installed shortly after the app had to be replaced by a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the release of the police , the app was aware that the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online fraud , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing pages to make user attention how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these features can be used in various ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers capable to manipul@@ ate or steal home network of a person or out of it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China are mostly focusing on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme ten@@ sions and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ e@@ zing Internet . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; , &quot; the cen@@ sored news in China , displayed photos by a check@@ point where polic@@ emen had in@@ discri@@ min@@ ately checked , whether they had the monitoring app installed . &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you discover a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have forced people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity through the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description published by Main@@ land China , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can raise the license requirements of a Windows operating system , allowing un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot;
&quot; after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones into X@@ in@@ jiang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council , to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related to the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication equipment . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang , the authorities issued a regulation on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; these action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible tre@@ aties , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death - Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ on ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep &quot; or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you see yourself and make sure you are all alone on a place where everything is van@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually revealed and after being dissolved and a truth reveals , which is clear , both from inside and outside . &quot;
&quot; one that makes its name all glory , too . &quot;
&quot; one who has defeated in a list of feelings and expressions , allow no met@@ aph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; but if you wake up the reality and looking behind the scenes , looking behind the scenes , beautiful scenes and per@@ formers - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve the smoke , and you &apos;ll be aware of your existence , even if the earth is caught on the axis of the monster . you will clear that you are caught between the walls , which your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to put my lesson , as the boss of security services form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he introduced his power over us by demonstr@@ ating the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn apart from a peaceful protein as dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the districts were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , un@@ condition@@ ally , in the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a town that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little so@@ oth@@ ful , after the power supply had to work in the quarter . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence , when I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to get together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us at a glorious picture that was full of my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you know that you have delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it &apos;s just interested in the barley . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid it up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can be swallowed down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have trained it all the way up to the office of the security service . &quot;
I joined there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you have &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry out if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ filled eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; and you shall look forward to seeing me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
&quot; maybe it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look to you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment , which could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet do I have no word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; in sol@@ itary and his father , there is equal to him . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with that , too . &quot;
the gest@@ ank of this cursed proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an se@@ ct@@ arian torture which I was exposed for months . &quot;
I crossed the farm .
&quot; at the first office , I leave everything I spend with myself . &quot;
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I think all the details exactly before I took the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably have a bigger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and may sit down immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell ; and I access an old @-@ tried communication method : with the fist to beat the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ Ã¤@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells was an honour@@ able man middle aged who looks like and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in total darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen at me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are one of his existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; investig@@ ators had insured me , they would be glad when I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would like to have a bird @-@ shy , to exter@@ min@@ ate all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s . &quot;
from the distance I still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; .
&quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of the destro@@ yer until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror into person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Donner &quot; , &quot; playing on 13 . S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
you are here to hear .
&quot; this was the mystery to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - thus they played their denomin@@ ational Er@@ pres@@ ales card , and they played the narrow vision of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans to a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the hearing and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions which ensu@@ ed him : &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can join this day and protest on demonstrations soon as soon as you will find an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
&quot; I am acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to myself , not to answer . &quot;
I really can &apos;t say that when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become a friendly communication for me to a ordinary communication tool .
when and what happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to become punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
in all its diversity .
&quot; his command is to give me so much flesh as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls the loving &quot; confession . &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak . &quot;
your hen gath@@ ers herself on your scre@@ am .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you can &apos;t stop your scre@@ ams . &quot;
my scre@@ ams don &apos;t have enough nor enough because they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
&quot; at my first capture , I asked me whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage bags or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to present ourselves from their sight , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the series . &quot;
&quot; I lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , which I heard . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down , and found no pleasure in it , which is why he attacked the next to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow through all the body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out onto the ground , was the perfect power director . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
this must have been at midnight .
&quot; I decided to lay down again , let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fil@@ s the space &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I reply with the voice of an angry young people : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry about . &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and go away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian rap@@ es@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community with free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b puts the most part of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ oth@@ ed on his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; what to be left , however , a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips have to be discovered . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced to flee from her village in Palestine , in which she lived as fel@@ lows ( about : farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for more than six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , who was transferred to the conservative majority and its old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression by art and rap@@ es@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism , and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only in its hom@@ etown Amman relev@@ ance , but also in cities dating from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders , and he can also feel the most devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it is not open , it is a special sealing against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b viewed his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ ck@@ eter of the second generation &quot; - so he was born even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man &quot; &quot; while in water sol@@ dered it into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot jun@@ ta has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking the stro@@ kes l@@ warm coffee , and the wa@@ xes of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it can easily be done to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in jail . &quot;
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan had canc@@ eled a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila already for the second time .
&quot; a certain Member of the Parliament , supporting the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual front@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , oppos@@ ing the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the members and former press pre@@ sidents of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert &quot; &quot; was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the sin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many claim that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab spring , human rights and free opinion in the Arab world may be dangerous acti@@ vism that represent the old @-@ approved legitim@@ acy of the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila inv@@ alu@@ able the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to be used for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should be the rhet@@ oric of rhet@@ oric , but actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alline reality reflected in Jordan that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b moved to the body of traditional gender nor@@ ms , causing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a obviously down@@ ward unknown woman , whose arms and legs rise up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them , which they should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honorary moral &apos; - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary Citi@@ zens reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan was still lacking that Jordan had become an institutional infrastructure to support victims , victims , or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for p@@ aci@@ ation fighting in 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of family @-@ famili@@ al violence , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also not rever@@ ence to rever@@ ence , that in its country long as a tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , but he sees his music that is full of explic@@ it concerns on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , but cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; he was dra@@ fted into me , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically active in the core , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which you can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he not@@ ices that any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and readers , and that comments on gender equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still have been cen@@ sored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn apart from the context , revol@@ ves and had been cen@@ sored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only one worked version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b buys open for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als do not dis@@ agree to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later working on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could be able to write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why is Jord@@ an@@ ians not able to do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , it is nothing new to re@@ iter@@ ate the government attacks on free opinion of expression and that progressive votes will be brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Agency took several former government officials and members of the teaching member states , with the grounds that they had expressed themselves on the issues of social media problems linked to the deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to that , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a contin@@ ual g@@ aun@@ t and take away . Jordan has led M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila to the second time in a row , but the way of progress - this is what it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - is sure that this changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dre@@ aming , like millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot;
&quot; he did not only dream of being his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be remembered by music , art and literature a real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bombs , stre@@ et@@ itions and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until far as far as far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to keep resistance and therefore also resist resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which belongs to A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these large and extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
&quot; it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory says that the festiv@@ ities , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been invaded in the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a superb view . &quot;
&quot; one can imagine only hard , how large these parts are ... &quot;
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en once again : two festiv@@ ities are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only truth - and to spend a stunning way in his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; seldom were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate job as the hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street smo@@ kes and illeg@@ ally drug traff@@ icking are everyday . &quot;
&quot; a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers which can form this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; unprecedented demand for hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers , which go to the utmost boundaries of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; experts relate to each other , to show who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( for more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school Augusto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found herself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to discuss their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , which allows you to find out their weapons in hair@@ dresser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the st@@ aff@@ able possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
&quot; at the beginning of the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their achievements : &quot;

the following article is the processed version of the &quot; Liebes@@ botanical messages in gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel stretched out , aff@@ ection to aff@@ ection ? &quot;
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cri@@ sti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) who encour@@ ages young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters .
&quot; recently , her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ ordin@@ ation of peace agreement was considered so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of Colombia , however , there is a long way until you can talk about one real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who had lived for many years in illegal camps , were subjected to a war rhet@@ oric and around the clock , their weapons must be entered into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , they now have to record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an were convinced that the young Colombia had to close together and would have to help with the integration process .
and exactly what did they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - who should then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as a inspiration for Camp@@ aign
&quot; the idea for Recon@@ ciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people who love to write on the day of thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need a lot . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told us on to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent . &quot;
&quot; so the plan , letters full of hope and support for former milit@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , which now will find their place in society and become a new life . &quot; the letters are willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal authorities of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ARC members set up , as they had done before , to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of arms from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different emotions you can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of tent where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a fatal weapon in the bush sha@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; then I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter I wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has something so nice , that &apos;s why I answer it . I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely and put me in addition to the pomegran@@ ate .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions to be his ste@@ am@@ ers and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else about life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of the star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; but now , I know there is a society outside there , waiting with open arms . &quot;
until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the beginning , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; students all grew up as a war , and the F@@ ARC had already been in secret . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views of the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this order , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never heard heard and had no electoral law , and to recognize that people who have often seen as monster , and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were surrounded by their habit@@ ats and their environment were very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed , and caused so much harm to bring us something , and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Colombia was made , that after the dis@@ armament of peace , there would be peace . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are willing to raise the weapons to rise and to protest their rights . and that is totally justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which breed , religion or ideology - to raise them over all those who are dre@@ aming of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . among us , who defend the life as the existence of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together . &quot;

&quot; homos@@ exual and que@@ er people living in Caucas@@ ian region , are exposed to a large range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; with terr@@ ors , activists have witnessed over the reporting period last months on the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which is related to the LGB@@ T@@ Q municipality over the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q municipality , is not until the night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experience with us , and talked with us what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has conquered international headlines , after several months after reports that reports the to@@ wing , torture and murder of que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who took the susp@@ icious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when they were grown up , you became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ ch@@ enen was experienced by the gender equality , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she brought the last end to the United States . &quot;
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer helper for human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone had needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . so there are no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya who can fix this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made by the What@@ s@@ App turn round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya : &quot; how long will you honour the family still , you pray ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
&quot; then I lost consciousness , and woke up the last end of the hospital in the hospital . &quot;
apparently some women had to get everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two j@@ ins in my right lung wing . &quot;
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood , and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some perfectly unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
&quot; the requested to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove that it was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they introduced absur@@ de demands : some told me , I have to prove it without through the streets ; others wanted me to rise in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was bad , and photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people said once to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic is ashamed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she placed a kn@@ ck around his neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved to a flat and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with covered window discs and a number plate with a rate of 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened the third time , it was clear to me that something was la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights activists re@@ prove the number signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give it their name , but I want to remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ realistic happened . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
&quot; just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought it without register without ID , without ID . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the tr@@ ash .
he arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a fore@@ igner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you are in safety , only because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you type . you even know your room number .
just to prove you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality . &quot;
some traditionally Caucas@@ ian elements I still bear in myself .
&quot; so much I wish it , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can &apos;t overcome me . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate her . &quot;
&quot; in fact , when we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I admit to me like the person looking out of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for this , I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
I spoke to someone who had one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that while Ram@@ ad@@ an were not arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably download the relatives , these are concerned about the problem with the concerned person and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by the blood of satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are now even gay men captured in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it was just not very many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped out of their relatives to make Kad@@ y@@ rows dish . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they may present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television , and claim that any village or a military base was attacked . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not just disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radic@@ alize . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m just someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people have gone out in this prison , after their b@@ art had grown . &quot;
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even taking part as these people . &quot;
&quot; but until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were still no reports to date . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would it not have been allowed to shave this man to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these per@@ ances and discover@@ ies of people who have been interested in a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair for ever .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already very well known when I was living there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much more secure than now . &quot;
&quot; in Russia , Russia wanted to bring us back to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization , &quot; but ultimately it was thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were broken ; I had coloured eyelashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Education of the Sch@@ aria has never been che@@ wed with only one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; there was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mp@@ ing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; mo@@ ck does not know about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , when they make fun of sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so you simply shut up their eyes , because they believed , they are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they have never revi@@ ved me never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ time work ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking to talk about mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us , but by the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel like people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had spotted and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; at the time , I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slow@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I still worked as activist activist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I comment out with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , past@@ ed , I begin to hospital and help them to get food tickets . &quot;
I have no cents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I kl@@ ap@@ per@@ te a curse .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ der .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s exactly the same like Che@@ chens , who want to do with foam in front of the mouth that there is no oscill@@ ating with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , who have Russians also ; on the whole planet , there are they - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; from there I come from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear something . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ able Muslims who walk into the mosque and during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of tran@@ scen@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that one is changing his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a exclusion . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will personally become so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n an increase of self @-@ mor@@ atorium within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ sels . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the suicide burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i , on 27 August , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the area of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that can arise in@@ ability to his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups that remain in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube shared video , the moments stopped after he had kind@@ led himself . &quot;
&quot; some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ . hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the fail@@ ures were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide who has acquired in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists warned that there were more to be able to take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hung . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a matter together : these were all family @-@ fathers , who felt by the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and maintain a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of Iran living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to den@@ ounce its living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took great efforts to complete the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most precious and valuable commercial space for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to continue only slowly , and the indigenous people only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ vic@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs to systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a multitude of dem@@ on , built by the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie . &quot;
&quot; these dem@@ me have only led to destro@@ ying devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture , as well as fish and palm trees . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ mon@@ zi @-@ young@@ sters rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who seek a job in primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions does not require Arab labor force , the local Arab ancest@@ or az@@ i has moved access to employers in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force her life outside of her home , Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancest@@ or , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace as even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated , weak@@ ened because speaking of Arabic language or of Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab ancest@@ or , human rights activist alarm , before the situation explo@@ ded . &quot;
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ akes up and having knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and committed suicide .

&quot; why not agree with the femin@@ ism identified , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot;

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions , where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - in particular white women , signi@@ fy themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even under@@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
&quot; women are still under strict observation , when it &apos;s about doing what they can do with her body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women encounter sooner or later in various fields of life to a gl@@ aci@@ al ceiling , and that discrimination are still across the many different countries and belie@@ fs . &quot;
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : when I come to speak skin color , rac@@ ism , black c@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ @-@ community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I &apos;m talking about what kind of femin@@ ist movement , there were many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - come together to sing &quot; their voices and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &quot; to sing &quot; to reach equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is a institutional forms of motiv@@ ating violence that we are subjected to black women to double @-@ fold manner . &quot;
&quot; or about that , black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and women are less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school more often than a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I want that all women , all men and all men each have any skin colour that have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot take into account the un@@ righte@@ ous@@ ities in their thinking that relate to gender as well as to the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight any more about my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spher@@ es , which has always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected . &quot;
&quot; in 1851 , when So@@ jour@@ ner lam@@ ented 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical regard is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to drive its eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to settle white women &apos;s importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give a home to women of different origin , and from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself full and completely healed from femin@@ ism and to join me from femin@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly , that is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women to our own ideas and bring us into the spher@@ es that will be created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana ur@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after having read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I have existed . &quot;
&quot; because of my dark skin and due to my existence , I recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life did not survive , nor ignored , still rejected . &quot;

&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its municipality . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river , which we had lost as I was a child , &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay . &quot; this article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft mar@@ g@@ inity ) that reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed for the protection of the affected persons .
&quot; A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she was not a police raid against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who became violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , a little time has passed and the police said , their statement would be laid to the files , but they could not do . &quot;
&quot; as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was shown because of abuse , the ak@@ ten@@ se ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also has nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved their ad . &quot;
the Teu@@ fel@@ ine of Viol@@ ence Against Women is difficult .
&quot; when women restore any time at all , they will generally not receive support by the State of State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men which they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to have victims of violence , report at all in the prosecution authorities . &quot;
content 1 stro@@ kes and Statistics 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that do not under@@ go non @-@ per@@ tin@@ t@@ 3 of the laws : good approach to lack of stro@@ kes and statistics
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a researcher in the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that would not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , at the District At@@ tor@@ ney General , there were 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went around violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads were killed by the police .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of the ads were found here . &quot;
&quot; in the indicators , 40 % of women reported that they were physically abuse , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic women Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on every woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this because of the failure of failure , two women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay was not an alleged off@@ ence , prosecution authorities can not be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country . &quot;
&quot; the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to its estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

&quot; invisible ab@@ uses and a legal system , which does not under@@ take anything &quot;
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z , the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that at the beginning , but afterwards , however , she should repent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but for two years , she carried out the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most important : &quot;
I never thought that I would have victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier this , I thought that the only women happened to be stran@@ gled because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like that , when they wanted to say that victims of ab@@ uses at least had a certain complic@@ ity in mind . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner had mis@@ used them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( I think you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partners managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to strike them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads , with the authorities , remained without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against its former partner , which developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it mainly went to money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; the laws : good approach , lacking implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not be applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of Mis@@ uses is a way full of resistance , and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ MH Men@@ os ( # non @-@ entry L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign based on Twitter that supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks to explain fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent crime @-@ continu@@ ance and tough@@ er to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to also win the dep@@ uties for the law , who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was fore@@ seen , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process cost that the victims of violence is at present themselves , if they just want to refund and maintain a safe place to state the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial funds for this :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of between human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking is to take place , that violence is no longer viewed as a bit . &quot;
&quot; whoever remains silent in view of this facts , makes it guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators will come off . &quot;
&quot; we need to refund so long , until mis@@ use is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was kn@@ itted among other things , which had called the partner in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year to ban on a newspaper continue to attack attacks
&quot; this website has been locked out due to a decision of the Information Minister , &quot; is on the homepage of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Chinese authorities signed an independent arab@@ ic @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on corruption in the Sultan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and acquitted on trial later . &quot;
&quot; in Oman , Oman , since 1970 , is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had taken his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of war . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Justice and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the s@@ ult@@ ans of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ dening efforts of security forces , especially the domestic freedom , including press freedom , restri@@ cting and human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and detained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ cts peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights systematically and ob@@ serves citizens , also activists , concerned , their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisoned three of her editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , had been published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ day parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . in this way , corruption took part in the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspapers Az@@ am@@ n , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS held the Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had worked as Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed on an in@@ definite period after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the court in Mas@@ kat took place the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both among other things because of the disorder of the public order . &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of an audience ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) in addition to an annual ban on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after having the use of an information network on the distribution of material that might be a risk for public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was set at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) , and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in the prison sentence of his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence of imprisonment .
the Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper appears to be exposed by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the Minister of Information received an order , with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended to three additional months and , with the Minister , adopted a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court to put the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at recent times the press freedom was hurt .
&quot; for further injuries , for example , include the closure of the independent journal Mo@@ wat@@ in and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the constant closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive injury of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Chinese authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly release and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , allowing their journalists to work on their work ; &quot;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country ;
&quot; 4 . in all conditions to ensure that human rights defended and journalists in Oman could im@@ pose their legal human rights labour and without fear of negle@@ cting , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans , to practice . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , as well as independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries with the promotion of Mein@@ l and Associ@@ ations , and the right to gather together peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ ite War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need for the necessary medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have greater impact as elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves in the building of its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier , Director of the Center for Inf@@ ection diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he attended the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media about these research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is based on research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant disease path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipi@@ ents instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the United States and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or move here , for financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it lasted months to import it from other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of the world , health care ( non @-@ transferable and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it very well . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across western countries - based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often there are a limited speed , things to do , and that provides access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine designed for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on bred Sal@@ ad since the 1980s in the USA Sal@@ ad .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ shred@@ ders , the first plant that has grown by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been reduced by his own in@@ tim@@ acy and the question how many sal@@ at@@ ees can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not use them further to the breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents do not only apply for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ru@@ ined leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more such patents have been registered and more plants like grain or cart@@ on sites . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food safety ensure the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still needs a salad , but it is now longer , as his work is still longer worthy of more restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if in a river a rock @-@ bro@@ wn@@ mo@@ cks lie to whom I have to break down . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go to salads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before court , no one can breed more than new sal@@ at@@ places because all features are patented , so it makes it as good as possible and tries to sque@@ eze the ones that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very c@@ auti@@ ous and ende@@ avo@@ red to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) . &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS drew red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ shred@@ ders in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be grown in space .

&quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence that this name sounds like that , as it would come from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
the open source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not being protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bre@@ eders are usable . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , shortly O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders are able to commit that some of them are far@@ med by them far@@ med seeds . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breeding it to produce such own varieties - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ents or prescribed .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds plays a role in larger interaction such as biodiversity , rights of the farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to use the latter or only little to use seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , as well as for example , it should know that the species is bred to themselves how this vegetables is bred . &quot;
nutritional effort without seeds of seed is not possible .

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of the food supply is at risk since the available Gen@@ pool due to more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , un@@ interru@@ pt@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , the director of O@@ ss@@ i , engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability . it found out that approximately one third of all cart@@ fleet features are protected as intellectual property , which is either not used for plant bre@@ eders either or not only difficult . &quot;
&quot; there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by dis@@ courage that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in even greater style pat@@ rons are as a salad or carrots . &quot;
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ fication
&quot; plants are so bred that they have targeted features - from such , through which their taste or their color increases up to such , due to which they th@@ rive in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents based on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing through more and more patents . more than ever before , as the changed conditions are pre@@ dict@@ able by climate change much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also important for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . in total , four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States have set up the company for the preser@@ vation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ ct that intellectual property tra@@ cts other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired . &quot;
often these instructions help others get to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection is not in@@ hib@@ ited by innovation , but promotes it to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years of waiting , until a patent loop loop , it is certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to wait for plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general public and we should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to ease their work easier .
&quot; that is what drives us , and it will be impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is interfer@@ ed on the concept to pat@@ enting the plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics . &quot;
the plants form them out and as bre@@ eder we have at least no idea how plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who is breeding a variety , also his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial farming , with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for their cultivation approach her@@ b@@ icides , bre@@ eder in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is very genetically modified . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that have participated in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for his breeding garden salads .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the mind that bre@@ eders would be innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like to produce new efforts , more powerful than businesses that pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you can be protected from the competition for 20 years , with which I simply makes it easy . &quot;
&quot; although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads out rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties . &quot;
it also supports it to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
&quot; ( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from land to land , absent from the O@@ ss@@ i obligation not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world may be taken over . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conventi@@ onally far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , she speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and worldwide trend towards sponsor@@ ing seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; program that the organization currently has a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems that should be scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish a Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report published . it represents the mind that farmers have to be able to exchange and improve the seed policies to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report also the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to recognize him soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mostly been counted where and how it is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role played , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information remain friendly - despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian Law , and the Constitution of the Arab world to defend their goal , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was not so important to overcome this goals and not admit that it was never so important as now . we hope to meet our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of the web@@ se@@ ings for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , in the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights Research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took his blog in the spread of colum@@ ns and articles , which he writes not accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , whom he was set up to b@@ ypass the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ u Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; Blo@@ gger , the supplier of which is also known in Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he was informed about the student pros@@ thes@@ es , as police viol@@ ated physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article turn primarily about politics and the human rights of human rights in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to be un@@ lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It is managed to conv@@ ey me the feeling of an offensive to conv@@ ey ; a arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the sperm blogs , as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles in order to handle c@@ ens@@ orship .
&quot; however , after having blocked him and that she should have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ ck go away the way up to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE , also documented the locking of providers through the removal of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we realized how the blocking of websites asked V@@ P@@ s . &quot;
such a practical practice indicates the intention of blocking the government to blocking content and filter to the Egyptian users .
&quot; in addition to this , the situation is intensi@@ fied that the decision decisions are taken behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population cannot proceed in case of trial against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the citizens are fighting .

&quot; daily newspaper reports from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs in Brazil . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot dead in school , &quot; &quot; Je@@ den the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; th@@ read@@ ed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force for Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis , in the middle of the economic crisis , the wave of 2017 in Rio reached the highest point for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called up the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all day and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; so the detailed reporting on violence in Rio familiar newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced the new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
&quot; the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper , saying : &quot;
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes reported in any big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , etc . everything , however , from the civi@@ lized standard , and what only happens in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so we can not exclu@@ de our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , announced that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper reports that there are 8@@ 43 areas according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas . &quot;
&quot; in the Editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; us is aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted too , can also be used , the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoot and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; does more than it benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to mark violence as &quot; war . &quot; this would be a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to withdraw responsible for the police . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning , as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself has shown - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and an historical and self @-@ pleasing negle@@ ct of public service . &quot;
&quot; reminder : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just his capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are wrong , according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available dates . &quot;
&quot; no , these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; if we watch the kill@@ ings per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 and writes them . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o is an extra one of the company Glob@@ o , the largest media companies of South America , including Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; on these safety issues , the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police unit , was founded in 2003 , whose goal is to take place by using a massive police gro@@ unding a fav@@ ela and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; at first , this actually resulted in a decline of violent deaths . since some years , the U@@ PP has had to protect the U@@ PP for several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities that the newly created police unit should actually protect themselves . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made out of one of his articles from 2010 , where he explains why violence in Rio did not apply - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to use funds and ways which are typical for a war . this is the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; with which a civilian is an in@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted glob@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her fact , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
a week it is now that the police ra@@ ced up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to revenge the death of a polic@@ emen .
&quot; in the midst of all of this violence , this incident made headlines : a fruit runner died due to but@@ chers , who fired the police from a helicopter . &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ lib in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons were affected by hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebel areas outside Damascus , which led to that people have led to local or dis@@ cour@@ ted food by tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teach the inhabitants of Eastern G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as it can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional , planted food and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its food makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged east G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the directive of the project , Maikel Nabil , said to the French News Agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we chose for cultivation of fung@@ us because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that already since three years has been fighting for this project , and sting his relief , that it now wins more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , start in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; planned to conv@@ ey 125 families of the cultivation of fung@@ us , Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will earn donations to Can@@ Do on Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is reli@@ ed on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel short@@ age , locally produced fuel from plastic are used to supply the generators in the necessary power . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that she began with the &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ us &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they designed a &quot; apprenti@@ ce farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eila declared that it is part of a bigger movement .
&quot; we want to teach the people of the fung@@ us for several reasons &quot; : fraction of the siege .
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ supply by food waste ( such as paper , tea , coffee machine , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot;
&quot; we want our experiences to help people in crisis areas , and we can help mankind . &quot;

Portuguese challenge justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; several hundred people were protest@@ ant on 21 October in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded righteousness for the victims of fires , which took place in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government that the government called for 3 days of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires erup@@ tions , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande took a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitored the forest areas by satellite photos , in 2017 alone around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so you can make a better picture of Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

many videos spread in the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the objective of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to interv@@ ene the extent of tragedy as far as possible .
&quot; JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al , the federal government of Portugal , declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o : &quot;
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; they did this Sunday , nowhere : there are dozens of reports from open roads , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , because the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permit can be deposited at a high level of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ sufficient suggest@@ ion to the forest form , which the government had taken into serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ ed by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a de@@ duction of the law , which allowed the activity of the case , when the applicant could disp@@ ose of funds for self @-@ protection - that was a open rear door , so that JoÃ£o Sor@@ val was going to be built in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out on that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees of light @-@ burning wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , still spread out to the walls of this species . &quot;
&quot; added to these problems , the website of the civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , sought for information about or tried to contact members , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used the civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade in October , so that the servers had followed this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers had followed , that the site counted more than half a million . &quot;

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , Afghanistan &apos;s conquest began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afgh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner together . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t tell it then , she knew that she would never see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
the boy was going to break down in dawn .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs .

&quot; Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the German @-@ e @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly protection . &quot;
&quot; for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara , Taliban came closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a co@@ co@@ sting . the work was difficult and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again , he found himself in a strange land along with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ar , which were heavier than he himself to earn his lifetime . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we mounted n@@ ylon before the open window so we didn &apos;t stop drinking at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af sent his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran behind and prepared for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ el@@ essly , running alone by the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day meal . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high levels of asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers can be found in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Human Rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially admitted a request for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; by then there are people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the streets . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ te@@ aring life , A@@ shar@@ af helped to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after having made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while , and opened a bar@@ gain . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award for the first time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; many bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional resolution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; some of Afgh@@ ans operated several of Afgh@@ ans @-@ operated companies , including cutting machines , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail trade , and aim to go back to the country which he had forced to leave a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forgot my country , and I can &apos;t live happy if I know my people suffers . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the country &apos;s poorest provinces , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af bears plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preservatives . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen Report : legislation from Egypt allow switching to social networks Mah@@ moud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in custody for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ ces report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges and trends in global Internet rights
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that sees social media , such as Twitter or Facebook , only after registration at a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to use to use the social networks , within six months after a successful legisl@@ ature in the website of the authority , using its complete name as well as their identification number . &quot;
&quot; whoever missed this step , could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or En@@ tri@@ bution . &quot;
&quot; the law , which has been advert@@ ised by sixty members of the European Parliament , is currently being deb@@ ated to the legislative as well as the parliamentary committee on the parliamentary committee . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Federal Government filed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or the High Authority . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ens@@ ity of the president as well as nation@@ alist institutions would have been pun@@ ish@@ able under the law of law , however , in accordance with the law en@@ forcement of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this could mean by up to three years in prison for the convicted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ go a political climate in which the right to free opinion of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud Ah@@ z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) that was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while taking violence against protest@@ ers who demonstrated violence against the military coup that led to officers of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who were arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a court date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May because the prison administration failed because of the human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ endants from the prison in the court . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups in@@ ig , spot@@ light load of among other weapons , illeg@@ ally gathering , murder and an attempt to murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists on en@@ forced documents for@@ ce@@ fully heard
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation by Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is mainly interro@@ gated on an en@@ forced action plan . according to the President of the Republic , the President of the Republic , who expressly accused an controversial bill of law , accused of accused amnesty . &quot;
&quot; the document , released on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , thro@@ ws a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ cal plans will look like to support the legisl@@ ature . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of its sources by article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press conference which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the Tunis District Court in Tunis on May 09 . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to introduce their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations on the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China before they write messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration must be required with the full recur@@ ring name . &quot;
&quot; analysts also susp@@ ect that by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in entertainment within social networks , it is un@@ clear how the authorities will apply this regulations . &quot;
&quot; Chinese network citizens suggested in the social media , which only sel@@ ec@@ tively continue to protect these regulations in order to protect the Citi@@ zenship and its independence . &quot;
then let &apos;s see in &quot; Wh@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , state c@@ ens@@ orship Russia locked the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , white @-@ chat , at the state government as &quot; organizer of information prolifer@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is leading a list of online services , which allows the publication of information responsible for removing contents and to force them on request for removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently present websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ c@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish dish has Sper@@ m Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish dish made the blocking of Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime matters and communication , has been locked down because it works to &quot; a source of information that deals with groups in order to address a political reducing campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is , besides , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access is not possible to Wikipedia . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop to kill her@@ ring
&quot; after this week , Britain &apos;s government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communication operations in real time and install back@@ sliding programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ul@@ ted telec@@ oms companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation runs until 19 May . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
