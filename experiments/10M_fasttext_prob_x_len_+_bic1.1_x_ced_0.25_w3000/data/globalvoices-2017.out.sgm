<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>

<seg id="4">"how many of my generation I also grew up with American films, I joined American music, read American authors and operated his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound impact on me that I was working mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who was the Supreme Court of Justice to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are, and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of parchinnate people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warmer love writing about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow-minded."</seg>
<seg id="15">He never believes in his mind behind the mountain as you are so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague, and explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people reacts on his testimony and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes cast at the Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number ever reached by the Party of nominated candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support those authenticated person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">"I could not get Trump and his voters in accordance with the people, which I met in Phoenix during my time."</seg>
<seg id="22">"like the example of my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, people from around the world, a deep believing man, with whom I was talking about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps agreed not to illustrate the worldview of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought for their lives in the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"still she fits with the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and wormwood and my colleagues to accuse us to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser has helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embodies my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump on his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America."</seg>

<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe due to its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they either were either racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke out almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the bump-voters as raassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"one of my friends, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"that is superficially and respectful, suggests a inability to understand those who act on a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes will not be taken into account in their municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most knows, are voted for Trump, because they want control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they would perhaps say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently than he looks."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm.).: as much as" rejection of the white against all other ethnicities "; word-game made of white into the white and whiplash, as it called the big Van Jones, exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always like, America means everyone welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, its history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to hell with complexity, religious freedom, and all the term of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again on the ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>

<seg id="51">"no!" "the amount changed."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they cried and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone, who doesn't like you, is a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan ended with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "36 hours later he was rectified."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country, the message said."</seg>

<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large landfill, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine."</seg>

<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students have become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces Mexicos is known for its drugs misuse and the Banden-violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had offered a rare hopelessness."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Emericias Oaxaca NVI writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>

<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion made all of the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local oist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, remember the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place, the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>

<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens within an agreement with Global Voices to the joint use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operating in Liberian waters of illegal fishing, before it was seeking the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries have risen above accordingly, and slightly inclined to welcome a criminal law of this kind in its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the tumors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized the ship quickly against the ship. they refused to give one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" suddenly, the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything "," Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing industry. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not managed to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia due to pillage in the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects the criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had driven out the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "thus, we have eight countries that are librit and work together. they do exchange information and stand for each other where it is illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, absent because of it is extremely difficult. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to unintentionally misempt existing laws, which are to be protected by certain habitats and species, the illegal fishing ecosystems cannot have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange any lists of existing licenses, news for suspicious activities or details that were noticed during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea with satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in banned territories. also, such suspicious driving routes also suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the idealcase, such investigations can indicate whether the involved ships have a fish attack where they were on the road and possibly even if they were a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports, which means that the ships can't sell their charge. and that they may even be forced to use penalties as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there is a significant financial losses for the owners, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve", "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a mountain company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $20 million to lost turnover, representing the eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing plants, which attracts the region's commercial fishing region around the world. among these also the same Illegal Fischer."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, actions include the sailing under false flag, fake license documents, indication of fantasenames, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "you use the missing international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system," "said long." "earlier, a ship was illegally fishing and a country could say 'You will not stop my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legale hole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been criminating networks which have distributed licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships which used several fraudulent identities and found volatile ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far in the networks of organisational crimes, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system to help FISH-i, suspicious ships more precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system which is always developed and helps prevent illegal ships to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "Illegal Fischer use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that we try to cross it," "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems, which they can't be used anymore by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"in this way, Copeland helps to build a system which links various information. it should help FISH help to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world's position every single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who doesn't make sense," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to join himself and join their resources for the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system approve the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which had been overfished in earlier without license and had hardly to be seen with consequences, now they know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH countries have now seen a 33% increase in fisheries, ever since fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing networks, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries notice these achievements." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear annually through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries gathered together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with safety is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions", "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia was able to report its first major triumph in Somalia: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only the ship was on the way and were used to tow-grids that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also involved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing." "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, evidence that such a special, collaborative work of the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the first and last time, he let me wait at the entrance in the car."</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he commanded me to get out. he led me to a barracks, in the car, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little bit wrapped in a blanket, and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day, I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut down and held me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners will be tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I saw in, and saw a song, tortured in man."</seg>

<seg id="244">"years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forgot this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much for another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father participated in the work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs and used them."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, an civilians who also was charged with the trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses, where naked people were bound with the face down, all were bound at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">In the proximity of the enchanted people still quietly on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">"as my father, I noticed that I saw to the prisoners," "What guckest thou so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"why did you escape, why have you brought me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a ditch and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told her home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Next to La Cuadra some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuadra until the arrangement of it came up that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - Euphemism - for revival of people and disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time in the age I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a fellow worker with this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay a burden to me what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families who were able to pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhorous act that you can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="356">"the correct English translation was initially removed, and the term" "Drivers" "(German:" "fearful drivers" ") was later replaced by the appropriate name" Elder Drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto prefecture accounted for the translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by the translator and that the translation was not tested on their correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," said the police. "</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread circulation of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to Survive, one requires two major skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and transfer language skills to transmit it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of target language - something that is in the case of maternity. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - Mother's language. "</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native speakers should translate into English for example from English to French - not from the French into English.</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue which could provide translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that have no foreign employees, let translations make them firmed internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best to interpreter - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translations are also common - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrens and enigmatic phrases which are created by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace long any human translators. this applies to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for temporary reasons - not to be read or not understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless or at least harmless. but of great companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, then a position would be set up in order to communicate social media citizens."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users would have to register users with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"will it be missed to do this, so that could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and is defined in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defined social media as" jedwede application, which is going on the Internet and used to communicate with other using voice, video files and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is passed when it is assumed, as the design is not given a hint on how Egyptian authorities are not to register the user within and in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary report and patrons of the legal situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and a password" to get a user name and a password "by the firewall to be blocked by the firewall."</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they are violent physical and private rooms, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, then it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens to resolve the approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a court."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must be discussed at the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committees, before it goes into the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the Miyagi Prefecture. the Miyagi prefecture was a prefectures in Japan's northeast, who had to experience the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring countries of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated because the tsunami had vanishing all coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the Fukushima prefecture continued to have a nuclear accident, because of that, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows that progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authorities as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>

<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement parts (range of mong, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi's greatest success among the three prefectures could be recorded, 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>

<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated from Fukushima live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated which were moved to the disaster in accommodation they were transferred to final houses."</seg>

<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with the drug trafficking to live ") that this victims will give a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between prosecution and cartels."</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>

<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or considered normal as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is great. and it's not normal that people listen songs about the" heroic drugs "of offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear they have something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories to blob numbers are in statistics."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of man is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to try out that they concealed from such tragedies, if they don't stir and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four Months Refurbishment in the main city District: "as a family with threats of threats, it describes how armed criminal month was destroyed by their business until they did not only spend their business apart, but also their family apart."</seg>

<seg id="799">"journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the" "forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez," a generation of violence. "</seg>

<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>

<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>

<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders in public security and government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecution counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to average 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul's soul."</seg>
<seg id="814">"few stories still live in view of a new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who we cannot forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "animal Político 2015 created the data journalism project Narcodata to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tortured the country in the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is normally used to assign people of eastern Indian origin or generally as an adjectively."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar "or as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the Ascension has given an extremely valuable connotation to the word."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as Hassspeech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today, Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism in connection, but the word itself calls not automatically to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that they also discussed the use of the word, or have doubts about the use of the word, censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings that have the same accounting sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar pae ',' Kalar Oat '(chimney) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">"a post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the Word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether they could cry out how he could relieve his back pain by doing a word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(u) + the questioner (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they will reduce hated language radical nationalists, and also emphasized that Facebook needs to be analytic that Facebook needs to be disseminated in suspicion in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write on Facing ook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what to do instead, the post is carefully analysing and check it by checking the words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spectins).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these three nationalists who disseminate hate language, receive a rather good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and Wechat, have demonstrated that the censorship of percussion is often a catz- and mouse game, whereby the users can use social networks just to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I got attentively carefully to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed. "</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail from Facebook was removed and me, the liken, post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community standards did not say."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has a variety of Posts from humans, who have no negative intentions, or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech radical nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with Hasselt:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, Burmese Internet community ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a welfare intent to reduce racism in Burma by their platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to centime will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"it also appears as if they have begun without local context or technical support, and as words like" "chair" "or" "heredcurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not tempt to correct posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefit they had a large turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has made a lot of mockery for a lot of mockery.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now consider using Facebook funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see if their posts will be taken from the net."</seg>

<seg id="1338">"Facebook was for his failure, the balances of hate speech on his burial sites under control, criticised."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, there are women with greatest care, the name of their husbands, or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect their husband because of the social pressure to disrespect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Osca by a pseudostems and violated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition also must not call their wives by name, but is also common in men. however, they have far less conditions to be feared if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"nine women, among them healthcare professionals and housewives, a unique club, came quickly into the village of Pune in Pune, in Maharashtra, and so quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"it is a place for them alone, in which they discuss the hostesses of Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which there is in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and establishes itself for the removal of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years, with the help of their videocamera, such as children's holy and AIDS-infected, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how this club created a safe place for this women and made it simultaneously to ambassadors of the mural.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini in their discussion round, did not use women who don't call their husbands at their name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem, with which the women can easily identify themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"according to the name of their husbands, a brilliance that they will not be found guilty and never put in question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition bears witness that a woman is respectful her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who doesn't last, is regarded as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never been named after her husband, who has never been named at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were still silent after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in their luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"according to the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," If we could not say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us to respect ourselves? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on the lips, says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women have never allowed the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise just turned away, and another decided to allow all the frustration against him and his family by releasing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the Adrenalexchange too, with an ancient spectacle, women decided that they would actually try their husbands at home to call their husbands at their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in her head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"her mother-in-law, she was afraid, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said that I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation occurred in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as carrying the interest of interest on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberred dot when he was doing it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only, and I listened to wear it."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not ceased to have stopped, but my, they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to carry him on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to worry about women, who could hear what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated her own birthdays in her life with cakes, they danced and sang talking about things that they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"for so many years I have been working on these problems and yet I have made some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands, never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things to say loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been killed in Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a salami-Kurta, a vast inhibitor over a trousers; they have not weeds."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing-selection, the morality linked to Saris and much more, dingoried Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion lap so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa at which they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure to make it possible."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion sklub has already changed, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some of me included, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberred at their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion lub know that the changes that they want to achieve in their life - like the line of freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman in the club goes home and other people told what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">"the correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from different groups in India, and make videos about stories that will not be reported."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages of those who do themselves "," and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development claims. "</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the state Association of New York, the Minister said that many people are criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody stated in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that is, whereby most people have a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," to turn the logic "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and offerings, this valuable land has to be created, you will say that we eventually have no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had a escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory breach."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which, he appeared uneven undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanent from a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as you reach the key point of the subject, the good old lyre from the authoritarian machiners appear to be present Democrats, leaving logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final effect the last week of Shanmutgam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He asked the appropriate questions with non-responses rational art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very thankful if our advertised K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, if it was paid to be high, in order to be part of the government's government."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog, he publishes his comment on the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire installment of the conference, so that one might understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the testimonials.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore is rather a" city "as a country," he declared why the elections in Singapore will be so unimportant, even if we are looking forward free and righteous elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He hired Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities witnessed such a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" was not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan reveals his disappointment about Shanmutgam as leader of a herent-growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>

<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yev and the members of the old Guard, which awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmutgam, a member of the new generation of Singapore's political leader, I have doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he defended."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmutgam has a mistake, or was it a free mistake?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique and it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role in the interact of government, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people serve their military service, but they defend their city only?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay our prime minister bills?</seg>

<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have a lot of people to be annoyed...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear, like" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but that's not quite right."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border of Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin with a small woman with a correlated pink spectacle and golden-colored earrings in a teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians that are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 Dollar per night, guests can sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, tells the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" mum Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it's rather quiet, but in this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would not reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"they also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys medications they are not able to pay them out with a balm that inexhausts from long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answered with a smile." I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to get her husband and her three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans which are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other directions by Mama Africa." mum Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"it tells us that the Haitians and Africans often go to travel together, and that, the Africans speak to WhatsApp of Mrs. Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been guest at Mama Africa for months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bustuet to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "he answered smile." we will always stay in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez told that their guests are often sending text messages when they went to grate them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the drive of its work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught, chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez may be very well known here but it is not the only sparks of migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The other end of the city leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"in this winter, Valenzuela and his family has recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Buchanets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for one dollar night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mostly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets at the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests can do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they're experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was referred to a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to press money, without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and a Unknown, an Allende, has offered it its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travelers will consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"today, a small bus has arrived and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is nostalgic, because of those who gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she flattered her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there are one of her daughter with African hair-fleets that you have made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and elderly."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she introduces them briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeat them every time. "they are already gone."</seg>

<seg id="1961">"the residents of Xinjiang, ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the phone users in Tianshan district received the Urumqi town of Urumqi, in which they reiterate the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning"). "</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" will hinder you access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities will also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women have been arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they were installed shortly after the app had to be replaced by a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the release of the police, the app was aware that the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, together with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom. "</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the block of pornographic websites, by online fraud, Troians and Phishing pages to make user attention how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these features can be used in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "or even hackers capable to manipulate or steal home network of a person or out of it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while announcements on digital censorship in China are mostly focusing on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme tensions and monitoring measures as well as routinemezing Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter based media outlet" Images from Mainland China "," the censored news in China, displayed photos by a checkpoint where policemen had indiscriminately checked, whether they had the monitoring app installed. "</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you discover a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"they have forced people to use devices, which are intended for older people."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the rest-growing technology.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"in addition, a Jingwang product description published by Mainland China, also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can raise the license requirements of a Windows operating system, allowing unrestricted access to the computer's hard disk."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones into Xinjiang will become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council, to minimize the spread of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and related to the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication equipment."</seg>

<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn apart from a peaceful protein as darnel from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>

<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism, and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only in its hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities dating from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders, and he can also feel the most devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if it is not open, it is a special sealing against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib viewed his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian gecketer of the second generation "- so he was born even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I'm a man" "while in water soldered it into two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot junta has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"generally speaking the strokes lwarm coffee, and the waxes of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it can easily be done to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to land not in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan had canceled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">"a certain Member of the Parliament, supporting the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronttsman Hamed Sinno, opposing the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the members and former press presidents of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" "was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the sinner."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"in addition, many claim that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab spring, human rights and free opinion in the Arab world may be dangerous activism that represent the old-approved legitimacy of the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila invaluable the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continues to be used for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should be the rhetoric of rhetoric, but actually a clear-crystalline reality reflected in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib moved to the body of traditional gender norms, causing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a obviously downward unknown woman, whose arms and legs rise up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them, which they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honorary moral' - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary Citizens reached its peak in 2016; however, Jordan was still lacking that Jordan had become an institutional infrastructure to support victims, victims, or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for paciation fighting in 1954, women who are exposed to danger of family-familial violence," and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also not reverence to reverence, that in its country long as a tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, but he sees his music that is full of explicit concerns on sexuality, freedom and expression, but cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he was drafted into me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically active in the core, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which you can get in his words," what you want "- be faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and readers, and that comments on gender equality between LGBTQ + individuals still have been censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgram Roya, to remember that his comments were torn apart from the context, revolves and had been censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only one worked version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib buys open for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals do not disagree to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later working on behalf of the Caliph, could be able to write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why is Jordanians not able to do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian kingdom, it is nothing new to reiterate the government attacks on free opinion of expression and that progressive votes will be brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Agency took several former government officials and members of the teaching member states, with the grounds that they had expressed themselves on the issues of social media problems linked to the deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to act a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continual gaunt and take away. Jordan has led Mashrou'Leila to the second time in a row, but the way of progress - this is what it looks like Hdaib - is sure that this changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib dreaming, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he did not only dream of being his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be remembered by music, art and literature a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streetitions and artificial kind of democracies. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until far as far as far, Hdaib will continue to keep resistance and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which belongs to Aman as a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large and extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory says that the festivities, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been invaded in the Northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only truth - and to spend a stunning way in his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to go into the experienced hands of hairdressers which can form this elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"unprecedented demand for hairdressers, which go to the utmost boundaries of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"experts relate to each other, to show who can create the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (for more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found herself in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to discuss their weapons against hairdressing tools, which allows you to find out their weapons in hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the processed version of the "Liebesbotanical messages in guerrilla fighters" which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel stretched out, affection to affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) who encourages young people to write guerrilla fighters letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the subordination of peace agreement was considered so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of Colombia, however, there is a long way until you can talk about one real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who had lived for many years in illegal camps, were subjected to a war rhetoric and around the clock, their weapons must be entered into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, who had accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate against guerrilla fighters, they now have to record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia had to close together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what did they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters - who should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as a inspiration for Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for Reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureates, which was held in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people who love to write on the day of thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need a lot."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told us on to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan, letters full of hope and support for former militants of the FARC, which now will find their place in society and become a new life." the letters are willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal authorities of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of BogotArt traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the FARC members set up, as they had done before, to counteract the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of arms from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's unbelievable how many different emotions you can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between, told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of tent where the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a fatal weapon in the bush shady."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"then I said to him," Hello, what are they doing? "he answered," I reply to a letter I wrote to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has something so nice, that's why I answer it. I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and put me in addition to the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions to be his steamers and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else about life than war. the FARC was the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of the starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now, I know there is a society outside there, waiting with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the beginning, students and some leader of the FARC came together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"students all grew up as a war, and the FARC had already been in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views of the peace process:" many years have experienced how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this order, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never heard heard and had no electoral law, and to recognize that people who have often seen as monster, and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were surrounded by their habitats and their environment were very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed, and caused so much harm to bring us something, and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Colombia was made, that after the disarmament of peace, there would be peace."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are willing to raise the weapons to rise and to protest their rights. and that is totally justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter which breed, religion or ideology - to raise them over all those who are dreaming of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. among us, who defend the life as the existence of existence, many difficulties are imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them together."</seg>

<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which is related to the LGBTQ municipality over the dorsal LGBTQ municipality, is not until the night."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experience with us, and talked with us what is happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines, after several months after reports that reports the towing, torture and murder of queer men in the Republic of thematised Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta, she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who took the suspicious men and put them in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world,"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny, and grew up there."</seg>

<seg id="2252">"when they were grown up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Tschetchenen was experienced by the gender equality, the hunt was opened to Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she brought the last end to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper for human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone had needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. so there are no men more in Chechnya who can fix this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made by the WhatsApp turn round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying:" here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned, I felt something in my body, but I hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a set, but this time on Chechnya:" how long will you honour the family still, you pray? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>

<seg id="2270">The women called a ambulance.</seg>

<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood, and put me to the women."</seg>

<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some perfectly unknown."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the requested to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they introduced absurde demands: some told me, I have to prove it without through the streets; others wanted me to rise in the official TV in Grosny, and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was bad, and photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people said once to my mother on the street.</seg>

<seg id="2293">"at the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to a flat and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with covered window discs and a number plate with a rate of 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened the third time, it was clear to me that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists reprove the number signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons, I don't want to give it their name, but I want to remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something unrealistic happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived."</seg>

<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still bear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I wish it, this seelic barrier can't overcome me."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"in fact, when we chatting with camera, I admit to me like the person looking out of her past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for this, I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who had one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that while Ramadan were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably download the relatives, these are concerned about the problem with the concerned person and at the end require a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced by the blood of satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even gay men captured in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it was just not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped out of their relatives to make Kadyrows dish."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that they may present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television, and claim that any village or a military base was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not just disappeared, but specifically dipped to radicalize."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm just someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people have gone out in this prison, after their bart had grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even taking part as these people."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were still no reports to date. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have been allowed to shave this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these perances and discoveries of people who have been interested in a so-called" non-traditional "orientation," already in the past? "</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already very well known when I was living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much more secure than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"in Russia, Russia wanted to bring us back to the" Civilization, "but ultimately it was thrown back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were broken; I had coloured eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Education of the Scharia has never been chewed with only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"there was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redemping: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "mock does not know about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, when they make fun of sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so you simply shut up their eyes, because they believed, they are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never revived me never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnadtime work?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking to talk about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us, but by the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel like people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had spotted and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"at the time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slowed."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still worked as activist activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I comment out with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we perfectly organize teetreffs, pasted, I begin to hospital and help them to get food tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I klapperte a curse.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alder.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that's exactly the same like Chechens, who want to do with foam in front of the mouth that there is no oscillating with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have the Cabardiner, who have Russians also; on the whole planet, there are they - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"from there I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicable Muslims who walk into the mosque and during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transcenity to men who love men, and they believe that one is changing his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a exclusion."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will personally become so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion, written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions, where many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women - in particular white women, signify themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even underthought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"women are still under strict observation, when it's about doing what they can do with her body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women encounter sooner or later in various fields of life to a glacial ceiling, and that discrimination are still across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: when I come to speak skin color, racism, black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ-community or black women from the Diaspora; if I'm talking about what kind of feminist movement, there were many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - come together to sing" their voices and "Kumbaya, my lord" to sing "to reach equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence there is a institutional forms of motivating violence that we are subjected to black women to double-fold manner."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or about that, black women and women of other ethnicities and women are less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school more often than a white girl, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the other hand, I want that all women, all men and all men each have any skin colour that have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot take into account the unrighteousities in their thinking that relate to gender as well as to the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and won't fight any more about my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spheres, which has always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, when Sojourner lamented 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical regard is a human and marginalised nature."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to drive its egoeccentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to settle white women's importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give a home to women of different origin, and from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself full and completely healed from feminism and to join me from feminism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so stubbornly, that is so stubbornly celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women to our own ideas and bring us into the spheres that will be created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana uranism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered to make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after having read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I have existed."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin and due to my existence, I recognized as part of this paradigm."</seg>

<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved their ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Teufeline of Violence Against Women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"when women restore any time at all, they will generally not receive support by the State of State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men which they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to have victims of violence, report at all in the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 strokes and Statistics 2 Invisible abuses and a legal system that do not undergo non-pertint3 of the laws: good approach to lack of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, Myrian González, a researcher in the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that would not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Attorney General, there were 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went around violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads were killed by the police.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of the ads were found here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the indicators, 40% of women reported that they were physically abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayic women Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually displayed." on every woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this because of the failure of failure, two women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay was not an alleged offence, prosecution authorities can not be adequately documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"the Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to its estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">"invisible abuses and a legal system, which does not undertake anything"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez, the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want to do that at the beginning, but afterwards, however, she should repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together. but for two years, she carried out the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most important:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would have victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier this, I thought that the only women happened to be strangled because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like that, when they wanted to say that victims of abuses at least had a certain complicity in mind."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner had misused them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (I think you ") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partners managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to strike them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads, with the authorities, remained without a result and also of their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against its former partner, which developed into an unmistakable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it mainly went to money, power and influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"the laws: good approach, lacking implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not be applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the ad of Misuses is a way full of resistance, and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Fürth)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiMH Menos (# non-entry Less) are part of a campaign based on Twitter that supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks to explain femizid to an independent crime-continuance and tougher to punish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"so the legislature has changed in some points to also win the deputies for the law, who feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill was foreseen, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost that the victims of violence is at present themselves, if they just want to refund and maintain a safe place to state the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial funds for this:</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine designed for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred Salad since the 1980s in the USA Salad.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outshredders, the first plant that has grown by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work has been reduced by his own intimacy and the question how many salatees can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not use them further to the breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents do not only apply for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ruined leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more such patents have been registered and more plants like grain or carton sites. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food safety ensure the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still needs a salad, but it is now longer, as his work is still longer worthy of more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if in a river a rock-brownmocks lie to whom I have to break down."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a split with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go to salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before court, no one can breed more than new salatplaces because all features are patented, so it makes it as good as possible and tries to squeeze the ones that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and endeavored to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"in addition, it is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" open source "breeding)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS drew red Roman salat of the variety Outshredders in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there will be tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it's not a coincidence that this name sounds like that, as it would come from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed initiative (initiative for "open source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not being protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are usable."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, shortly Ossi, US breeders are able to commit that some of them are farmed by them farmed seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breeding it to produce such own varieties - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patents or prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds plays a role in larger interaction such as biodiversity, rights of the farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only little to use seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "who wants to buy good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, as well as for example, it should know that the species is bred to themselves how this vegetables is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional effort without seeds of seed is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide others their seed freely available. thus, their approach in contrast, seed and plant features are patented."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-Supporters argued that the future of the food supply is at risk since the available Genpool due to more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, uninterruptedly."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, the director of Ossi, engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately one third of all cartfleet features are protected as intellectual property, which is either not used for plant breeders either or not only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby discourage that massaging plants like wheat in even greater style patrons are as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visification</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted features - from such, through which their taste or their color increases up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents based on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. more than ever before, as the changed conditions are predictable by climate change much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also important for Monsantos activities. in total, four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States have set up the company for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradict that intellectual property tracts other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection is not inhibited by innovation, but promotes it to be provided by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other: 20 years of waiting, until a patent loop loop, it is certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to wait for plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general public and we should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to ease their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that is what drives us, and it will be impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is interfered on the concept to patenting the plant features:" we do not create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them out and as breeder we have at least no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" who is breeding a variety, also his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial farming, with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation approach herbicides, breeder in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very genetically modified. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that have participated in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the mind that breeders would be innovative by avoiding plant patrons:" it looks like to produce new efforts, more powerful than businesses that patenting. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago," he says. "with a patent you can be protected from the competition for 20 years, with which I simply makes it easy."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the United States seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept spreads out rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed programme. the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an "open source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for the breeders differ from land to land, absent from the Ossi obligation not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world may be taken over.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally farmed plants should not be patented. thus, she speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and worldwide trend towards sponsoring seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's" "Open Source" "program that the organization currently has a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems that should be scheduled next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish a Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global Alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies such as WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and other - a report published. it represents the mind that farmers have to be able to exchange and improve the seed policies to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report also the importance of a varied, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes to recognize him soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mostly been counted where and how it is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role played, so Luby." we are trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food. "</seg>
