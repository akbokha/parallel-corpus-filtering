this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he spectacular published that the NSA would be illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation where the CIA literally gave dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but you know whom the chapter is not pleased ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government against ra@@ isen was determined and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and to defeat journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional System , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right if media don &apos;t get this information , and if they cannot protect the Mu@@ tigen &apos;s identity they give . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at R@@ isen ank@@ le , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters had already done before him : he refused and said he would prefer to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was at risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something exceptional happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were for years that it would be indispensable for its case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failure and travel to the statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and thus , the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , concerned his telephone , are concerned , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ kin@@ information , its credit balance , and even travel programs with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ome source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect his attack , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government guarantees much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we put the press coverage on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaints , because the government has more possibilities to explo@@ it all . &quot;
&quot; but just like technology of the government permits to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; from the moment they can contact them from the moment , in which they contact , rather than in the night , in the stuff . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that it hasn &apos;t existed , as R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source trans@@ mitt@@ ing system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet most famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which I have been working today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news web site , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can instantly upload documents or sending information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot do more information secretly , and many of the information that would like them would not be available . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments over the whole world will always develop new spy technologies that all of us endangered . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that not only technology ken@@ ner such as Edward Snow@@ den have one way to kill ini@@ quities . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who will report about confusion in the supply of soldiers , and of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm for the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t strikes . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; however , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes committed , but to protect our constitu@@ ent rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ aning of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &apos; Panama Pap@@ ers &apos; revealed that the rich and M@@ ight &#93; &#91; enormous money &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this week &#93; have been revealed by news about an L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ pun@@ ca . &quot;
the publication of this documents gives a small gli@@ mp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we will receive a impression of what customers , banks and attor@@ neys to companies such as Mos@@ pun@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge that ? &quot;
&quot; in fact , we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already lead to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland prime minister has stepped down .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad correspondence companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads over a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , which wait nervous to the next publication , and on the next post documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; she cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why would that happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ases of some few are used to hide and conce@@ al -- something that we have been discussing and reveal themselves for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appears this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how these control points function . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
it can be very difficult to pro@@ secutions and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what matters .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; probably , because it has been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but through the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ l@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ aning of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have the connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to find less information in order to establish a company than to obtain a library . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed staff from school districts to im@@ min@@ ate school children .
it has allowed che@@ ers to turn off particularly vulnerable anch@@ ors .
it is this type of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this in practice looks like .
how does it work ?
so we sent an investig@@ ating investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister to bring susp@@ icious money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , private jet . &quot;
we really sho@@ cked us that everyone could make suggestions for our investigation as he could transfer@@ ed his money .
&quot; these were all pre@@ dict@@ ings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given to the money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it does not work for a single lawyer who advoc@@ ate our covered investig@@ ator proposals .
&quot; it does not work for a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if it is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
but as a borro@@ wed optim@@ ist I see that a lot started to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen fore@@ sur@@ ges to greater transparency , affecting the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really stands behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have gathered a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ents , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge gli@@ mp@@ se into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency to the U.S. and global for greater transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are fur@@ ious , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ less companies . &quot;
&quot; managers in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and deplo@@ y himself , through laws this kind of in@@ transparency to finish . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transparency , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I have been ab@@ duc@@ ted once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a rear sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked upon my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip to the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me saying : &quot; I have an air fro@@ ze . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I turned onto the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh , man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild bo@@ oth@@ s sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , on a ti@@ bet on the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art that he had bought from me today is in his class@@ room . he is now teacher . &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my angle .
&quot; perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were , actually , friends who were waiting for it ? &quot;
&quot; when I went to San Francisco , people were normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let us make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws from and the rent will be exalted . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can create , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow vill@@ agers Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think we could earn something like we could earn . our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded the &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure to decor@@ ate our Che@@ ese ham O@@ mel@@ ettes completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and threw the door to the castle , Brian and I joined . &quot;
did we just discover that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came to rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to figure out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the other public pictures of their private rooms , their bedroom , their baths -- the type of rooms that includes doors . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite wildlife to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile would be ign@@ ited .
but did it not .
&quot; no one , who is still with comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can be found on the things you can well . we were able to design@@ ate them . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
&quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree we have confidence . &quot;
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quiet An@@ flight of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time . &quot;
&quot; because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone , your home is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can &apos;t only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so who has actually Al Go@@ res mobile ?
&quot; could you tell Twitter , tell you that he di@@ des for the office of the president ? &quot;
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor could only be presented with his name , if he would have told how he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments which will say : &quot; he can really hold on very well ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ engine@@ ered feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their ass@@ ess@@ ments , before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to ages and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ ference .
&quot; it is exciting , when you add the call for a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; if one has less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is among the common@@ alities .
so the right design can therefore help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ference .
&quot; in addition , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are reas@@ onably priced . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you &apos;re telling about it , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of op@@ enn@@ ess , for example &quot; T@@ olle artwork in your apartment ! I make with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount text . we also give tips to which topics you should write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on hope , that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ce towards strangers . &quot;
&quot; with which we did not reck@@ on , the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; here , see how many people take care of our offer . &quot;
you can recognize three things .
&quot; first , unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need which had not been covered before .
for us the business is very good for us .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have allowed parties to be celebrated or homes rav@@ aged .
hosts have guests staying in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all telephone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing lim@@ mer than this calls . it &apos;s hur@@ ting when I just think it .
&quot; dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of 123 million people had a problem . &quot;
because people confi@@ de in right to each other .
&quot; when confidence works , the miracle process may arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack there .
his host went to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to use heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know any right . &quot;
&quot; you drive a hospital in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books . &quot;
&quot; you can stay longer , without charge the extra @-@ night . &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure cash transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled on this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of participation with cash transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade here .
&quot; but we just call it just &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not just right . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
people lay a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; if you are traveling today , it is efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
&quot; however , what would happen if traveling is a generous buffet from local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place we visited , a group there would be visited to fill a thor@@ ough and look at a bar @-@ tour quarters , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you need to learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy .
what if we were able to design apartments for the reason ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thoughts of common shares ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and dis@@ ot@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in Seoul , Seoul , this project was already begun . many parking places were included in the government , &quot;
&quot; residents are offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people , whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even hosts . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find the correct design with the inventory of confidence . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deep root pre@@ judi@@ ce .
I think that &apos;s amazing
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da pass over me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design can not solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ resses , under@@ wear a brain la@@ undering , a terror ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so the media represent the media , which look like me . &quot;
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know any Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ger @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ k@@ erin , &quot;
and I am a pract@@ ising and spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , Baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to decide .
when I was 17 I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as homos@@ exual human , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the lust was : at that time there was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , and against the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , felt me a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have ended with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; I read it , thought , and thought in question , doub@@ ted , and eventually believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow de@@ vot@@ ion who deep@@ en himself with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
sometimes the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me to weep .
I recognize myself . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you completely understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
so it feels like that .
&quot; later on , I married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then the aw@@ ful morning was in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had ended at the end , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people don@@ ate from buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only my country was attacked , but in N@@ u turned me the works of others from a civil war into a susp@@ icious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Central West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I drove me -- so deep it went into my seat square , and I was the first time I feared as the Muslim . &quot;
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful in well @-@ lighted contra@@ ctions , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t connect to you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , to which Muslims gather to prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque might be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ able , as well as I heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people who were made for Muslims , in the free disin@@ teg@@ rate of Muslims . &quot;
there were really bran@@ pts on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have the rage of people behind the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to keep himself out of itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims . &quot;
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is just under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , educ@@ ators and teachers . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking places but not stop the terror .
&quot; regular visits to a mosque leads to people from other faith toler@@ ant , and show greater ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellars or in bed before a computer .
&quot; when the radic@@ alization process has found that it begins online . as a result , the person will be cut off from their congregation , even from her family , so that the person believes the terrorists are true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS justified their brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a man , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would include ourselves in their fore@@ arms , when you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you thro@@ ws a look at her , she doesn &apos;t drive what they read in her &quot; Holy Scri@@ ptures . &quot; &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality which they read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had the deposit to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have given their anger , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who had a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam introduced the connection to God and its church again .
&quot; rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed their con@@ structive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS . &quot;
it was a gli@@ mp@@ se of how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day in our mind of mind ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : if we fear we will pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; one study shows : if one reported test persons messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims go down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this was three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool to mani@@ pulation the public to investigate the foundation of a free company that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear will harm us all . &quot;
&quot; at the assignment of collective blame , it is not only about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
&quot; he was on the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet@@ est , more generous person whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him and he showed her his CV . she was bl@@ oss@@ oms and said :
&quot; when is such a sealed young man from my breasts ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been visiting the afternoon , as in a execution where he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ at@@ ism cannot only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was about to leave America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one that we can freely pract@@ ise our religion . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , went out my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed us our guests , because half of the assembly were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came to join us but to join us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I &apos;m collapsed . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
are you going to go on safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you so much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have met a Ner@@ v .
&quot; but I wonder what you say that you may say that you &apos;re talking a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thought with deep @-@ speed factory , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever performed study on Muslims around the world , people want people normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity to family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , I &apos;m an exception in any way . &quot;
&quot; if people seem as an exception to rule , then the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you so much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for hobby , stands shortly before , to become a billi@@ ard business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . it is possible for research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before the air @-@ par@@ etz@@ als presented in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
by connecting air tools high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
they can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
&quot; you have learned to carry bur@@ sts , to deal with turbul@@ ence and react generally on natural law . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility within the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , an autonomous system works , there must be colle@@ c@@ tively known , where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our lab@@ ors . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest quality . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called stern starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , which tries to beat two flying with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; contrary to most starters , it can floating , and it has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
limitation of he@@ dge@@ cut@@ ters is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ences such as wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position can restore the optimal position and improve the performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often constitute basic abstract issues that occurred to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts , together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; before decades , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flying equipment that had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern @-@ ru@@ der . &quot;
we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ised sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was recently invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it only has a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no g@@ rope , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse , no further actu@@ ator or control surfaces , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so it can fly stable , and can move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant Algorith@@ m of the stern . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood , it is just right to throw it right to me , is low , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that it is only symm@@ etri@@ cal .
therefore he is equivalent to its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the most amazing ability to offer : &quot;
&quot; in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as he rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight pro@@ pane . &quot;
&quot; some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest will be learned directly when flies . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this revol@@ ves clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you assemble them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , a bit wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making a half @-@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was syn@@ thes@@ ized synthetic heat .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms . &quot;
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
&quot; hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the particularly safe machine because I would like to use a flying lamp on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types , like us , wages in development and working act lies . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise creatures to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i .
thank you so much .
&quot; some 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far away , two black holes surrounded each other in a very far away , so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lighten@@ ed brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe . &quot;
it was a very great pop .
but they didn &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time feelings and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; first , we arrange the events at first time . &quot;
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell lives were originated in the earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand to us - even the internet . &quot;
&quot; some 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognised it as a crazy gen@@ ius so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ation @-@ ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase , which improved its detection performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you call him the Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , hard @-@ sensitive issues . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation of the two colon@@ iz@@ ations caused black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector too .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my to@@ dk@@ u father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all this , what I had worked for , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ation of black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a conv@@ ent in the sense of space and time .
&quot; when entering the wave , the space and its total content is stretched into a direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustr@@ ate , lectures in courses for rel@@ ativity is often quite al@@ ber@@ ized dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous , are . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us stretched the waves , and the stretching of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o @-@ employee for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would be exactly measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a atomic nu@@ cle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are massive . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; in 1973 , Thor@@ ne published his success in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims , Lig@@ o was more one ear than one eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s quite practical . because , you can make a picture or a map of things you can perceive the light around you by several points . &quot;
&quot; in killing , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you special : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and level , rhythm and volume , to close the history behind . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interru@@ pts her . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob , &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can not make any simple pictures of objects in all .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so if we convert wave pattern in Sh@@ all , we can speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; gravity of gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott are very busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very fast , hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; J@@ one who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which are about as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine the forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it never was possible .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the everything and hear the invisible . &quot;
&quot; much in all , we can see -- practically or in principle -- not to see . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why massage stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about this .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes occur in the core , behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon , and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation perme@@ ating iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the primitive scar@@ ce would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , as the urine is covered by his own im@@ press . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most import@@ antly , I am optimi@@ stic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Lig@@ o found herself in the first approach that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body out of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us a completely different perspective on the events of all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be so bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time I tried a experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; Yes &quot; , &quot; I was afraid of which I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it was nervous , I was nervous that brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with what ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain meaning that my life changed , un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a matter of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls from in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; bi@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a wa@@ it@@ ress , it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south . &quot;
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my che@@ que . &quot;
she once asked me whether I could play with her when I was at the leap . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Ye@@ ah was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to me always with them as soon as you &apos;re going to call me . no matter what I am doing , or wherever I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve a lot . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a striking side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ agen to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things look forward to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I create television .
&quot; I make television , in large style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for the 70 hours program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each program offers hundreds of jobs , which are not existing before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; one new episode has four days four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which are simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my television series work on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; around the world , my series will run in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I create itself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ clean . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans for bon@@ fires and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn round the world . &quot;
do you know who makes this yet ?
&quot; nobody , because I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would like to im@@ press you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work as hard , whether you are now a company , a country or a budget , take me seriously when I say that I don &apos;t just understand by computer , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that there is no dreams about dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
when I deep@@ ened into the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dream one , one of a high sound , gives a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous , in@@ exhau@@ sting , funny and un@@ distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is such a change in me when work is good .
&quot; a sum@@ s start in my head , and it grows and grows like an animated street , I could go for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I don &apos;t talk about writing that writing me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with television production , when I started working and working , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the Sum@@ m@@ ness is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t stri@@ ve differently than according to size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not differently to stri@@ ve to stri@@ ve to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means an Work@@ book .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it &apos;s called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I only want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to put it clear : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more superior limits , the more things there , the more things , the more things I write history , the more things I write about history , the more expectations . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s that sum@@ s the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ flowing , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a only working title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; Bi@@ bs , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I don &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , performed weekends , no pen@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , don &apos;t give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
&quot; in me , silence was quiet . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showing Titan ;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so , what do you do when doing what you do , the work you love , suddenly infl@@ atable ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some like : &quot; Heu@@ l you , stupid the author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you do what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , one teacher , one mother , one mother , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s , when you know the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ able is a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; mom , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will already say No , when two things are aware of : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; shame . &quot; &quot;
they call no more &quot; Bi@@ bs . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I leave it when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s , and everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
that is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , can &apos;t make anything , except to fit . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sticky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , watch@@ word pins and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl &apos;s in &quot; Die Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ c@@ ely that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy hub comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel like to know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I say you who I am , using Shows and TV hours , and how does my brain work , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not unemployed .
it depends on pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from the life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are to do with the tasks , the expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I am doing this for a fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ man by any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
don &apos;t play an@@ sat@@ a for me as working .
&quot; the truth is hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I rather am at home than at home .
&quot; this confession is painful , because what kind of man works better than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; none of them is to be relaxed , none of them . &quot;
&quot; we are sha@@ ved in the garden , before and back , and from . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we crushed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always invite you to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me . &quot;
I play and play until I wonder : why did we stop playing with the games ?
you can also say ! they always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ ive for a day of day .
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they pers@@ ist that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; each can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ lap day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no washing , no deposit . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my goodness , my world . you don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for peace of peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own children , it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
around the &quot; games &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I will come . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I was abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why do not indul@@ ge for a full 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . sum@@ s seem to be returning when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months , a door open in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she ful@@ fil@@ s me and my soul . I &apos;m looking forward to new ideas . I &apos;ll use it in full turns and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that Sum@@ ms is not me ... no more .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sticky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the Sum@@ m@@ ness of Love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but just one part . and so I am so thank@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; it is my mind that I am a titanium . I have never seen one Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn still .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country that I run , the marathon , whom I run , the troops , the noise , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s that sum@@ s the sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more it makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things , I wake up for life . &quot;
&quot; it belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ help . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is the reason why I was working in functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; for sure , they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep @-@ cereb@@ ral stim@@ ulation . &quot; it is im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logic function improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ ors and heavy pain .
however Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the rest@@ oring of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I supplied patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that brain trau@@ mas and the skull @-@ pressure is incl@@ ined at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a .
&quot; in order to save life , you must decrease the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of the brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
&quot; to let the cells grow from a tissue , comparable to all small children who are out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to th@@ rive it . &quot;
this we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to work . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with great green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you know from the biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of organism .
&quot; adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ otic brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population who looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
&quot; we needed for a long time to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ rum @-@ rin@@ d cells .
they play an important role in our development .
&quot; in the F@@ öt@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells are exactly how it did Jean François Hollande
&quot; and afterwards , it can mark colour@@ ing to track them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the disposal of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ tes , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken after some weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they won &apos;t leave there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we had an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained , they grew up to neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take food pellets for a tray .
they made it very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we spent the motor @-@ motor range in mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they re@@ juven@@ ated spontan@@ e@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover themselves with plastic bra@@ ins . they are recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , they see the monkey , which repeated spontan@@ e@@ ously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance in front of the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now you see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after matur@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; but our dream is still , to im@@ planted them at people . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how human brain gives us the means to heal himself . &quot;
thank you so much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can do that . &quot;
I definitely will .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are , before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to fill this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone will come into the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to launch the authority soon ?
you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one must apply this to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one .
&quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you so much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a big mistake to look at it as of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant they are in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ge@@ aring .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy over@@ comes with us in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was in@@ comprehen@@ sible to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programmes that have been realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev or the Communist Party of China , or some of my appe@@ aling friends who would have repeated me if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I beg you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group in a mistake , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point out to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened by our host . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin peaks @-@ parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the prohib@@ its savings and corporations that could be anxi@@ ous where it could be productive , and could also produce all the things that humanity are urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the last 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 billion US dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars , which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around , and absolutely nothing , except the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore a low total demand for investors who would not invest in which they could kill him that his son would kill him when he is growing , &quot;
&quot; un@@ wanted to lead the circumstances that kills it , that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him . &quot;
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely poll@@ uted art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives and develop especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the Earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the arms control the government as a majority .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , too many out of -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course , slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake , the job value of ath@@ etic democracy due to these connections . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the right poor , and not only the right to free opinion of expression , but rather important and crucial to them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same ab@@ bal@@ ances in questions of state defense . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long --
&quot; like a candle , which sh@@ ines very brigh@@ tly , it is burned quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our today liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came first , when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was imposed upon policy , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; since that time , in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies there has been since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able battle between the two , while the economy gradually immig@@ rated and escaped . &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians do not have more so earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it lies that you can be in the government nowadays , and still not in power , because the power is separated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of wild animals that feeds so sustain@@ ably the animals , of whom they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations increases , the ine@@ quality is growing , the overall economic demand is falling , and the general manager of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the successful capitalism had the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labor force and the welfare of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have the policy and the economy must be gathered together , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; ret@@ ains control , as in ancient Athens , besides the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea before 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
&quot; the doctrine of Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be , that the poor poor should only recover through a miracle as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
&quot; capitalism does it , in which he was replaced by low form@@ work by autom@@ atics and robots . &quot;
&quot; the problem is , as long as long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be the twin peaks , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so , we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and to make sure that we should democr@@ at@@ ize the re@@ united area , otherwise we will appear in a hospital monitoring Hyper@@ auto@@ k@@ cracy which will appear in the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so , the question isn &apos;t , whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to which in &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; is solved , or by something that the society should be used in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines use their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimi@@ stic .
&quot; so what does it mean , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in all soon . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please fill up a capital market , where you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and revenues come from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies do not work therein , and employees working there where the company does not belong . no diving between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and spar@@ es , and ultimately no run twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please note that our national currencies would have a freely exchange rate exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; . &quot;
&quot; continue to imagine that the whole world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in front of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they have privileged persons , and mar@@ tial , because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you put yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ tible Mar@@ xi@@ est .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , the technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; due to the transmission of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next one , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , why am I a Liber@@ t@@ itious Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you do not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Red@@ ner , you have clearly said what you think about the view of the West on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the acceptance of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy does , -- the realm of the economy -- a completely democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain respect , if I may say the so @-@ prov@@ ok@@ ative , China is similar to the UK of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- it &apos;s a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China , similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to act now , China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells tremendous after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister in Greece &apos;s beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I warned that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say goodbye to self @-@ counterfeit , and den@@ ying that a massive rise line through the euro zone continued , and continued to pursue the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek court - the way , the first proposal to deny this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; right to make it right . unfortunately , the powers in the euro@@ zone still have chosen the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries an economic system that is not viable , through political will and Auth@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it might perhaps occur a while , but if the change occurs , he ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : what change will you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t change the Eurozone if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes made in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Harvest
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims that he did not make mistakes , then that &apos;s a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for pro@@ long@@ ation of the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the pages of the money to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to fall down our government , but because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the shipping tests that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that it was a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; there was none of the Tro@@ ika of the money , which imposed us this policy , said : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of conversations , you seem to be right pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , they will be released to destroy and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we admit ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , which appears to me , it will be as well as for the future of European as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re very wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is : thank you so much for you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of Roy &apos;s have never heard most of them , although it probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and the content to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not select any any .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this turn . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation classification of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then one has a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after you saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that &apos;s enough to tell you what is going on at that end of the turn . &quot;
Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to under@@ take &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; it turns out more thoughts on the middle balance , the average television - shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing so something , so Roy wants to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of any of these shows , and represents them online where they can see each free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is free for free things , one can interv@@ ene , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators watch this episodes .
however they don &apos;t know that they are watching in watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team to record everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you are p@@ au@@ ction@@ ed , which parts may be ski@@ pped or again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data , in order to decide which show them should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and hence the answer is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time there is another manager at another company with data analysis pl@@ az@@ ed . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly how Roy is he always looking for doing this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to figure out these little details about the viewer : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very competent , data diversi@@ fied firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data and it works fine for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that is met , you should meet a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it &apos;s optimized by very powerful computer .
&quot; the least , what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is something terri@@ fying because we are living in a time in which we take more and more about statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the US and asking for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad , it will decide whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data &quot;
not always the best results . this is not the fact that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems do not know how to use data .
the data have also been sealed again .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful species , to predi@@ ct -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news message . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data can have experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data del@@ ights in decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious choices , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have identified several patterns of the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , you will be able to analyze this problem in his individual parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place you put the individual parts together to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to pick and up@@ set . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how power@@ fully , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to assemble the parts , then come into a decision . &quot;
there &apos;s another tool and we have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , then a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to understand their audience better , why they would not have been able to understand all of these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that stood not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were looking for TV @-@ ideas , then called &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; let us tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before it was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly this moment . &quot;
&quot; later , I &apos;ll find it later with a technical demo . &quot;
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much wis@@ er than data analysis to make better choices . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is to meet the decisions if we want to achieve exceptional at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that it will still be paid to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data , a expert in which you do to do and risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , there are not the data but the risks involved in the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you beautiful .
