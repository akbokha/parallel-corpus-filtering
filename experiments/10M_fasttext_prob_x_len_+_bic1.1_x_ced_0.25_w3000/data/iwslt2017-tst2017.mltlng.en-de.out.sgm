<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacular published that the NSA would be illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation where the CIA literally gave drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know whom the chapter is not pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government against raisen was determined and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, Whistleblower and to defeat journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional System, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right if media don't get this information, and if they cannot protect the Mutigen's identity they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen ankle, he did something that many brave reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would prefer to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was at risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something exceptional happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were for years that it would be indispensable for its case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and travel to the statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and thus, the investigators, without his agreement, concerned his telephone, are concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bankininformation, its credit balance, and even travel programs with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risome source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect his attack, Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government guarantees much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result that a Whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we put the press coverage on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaints, because the government has more possibilities to exploit all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just like technology of the government permits to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"from the moment they can contact them from the moment, in which they contact, rather than in the night, in the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that it hasn't existed, as Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmitting system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet most famous Aaron Swartz, which I have been working today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news web site, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can instantly upload documents or sending information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot do more information secretly, and many of the information that would like them would not be available."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments over the whole world will always develop new spy technologies that all of us endangered."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that not only technology kenner such as Edward Snowden have one way to kill iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who will report about confusion in the supply of soldiers, and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint strikes. or a Wallstreet insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes committed, but to protect our constituent rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leaning of history was published.] [the 'Panama Papers' revealed that the rich and Might] [enormous money] have been hidden in tax havens.] [what does this week] have been revealed by news about an Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's law firm Mospunca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of this documents gives a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will receive a impression of what customers, banks and attorneys to companies such as Mospunca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in fact, we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already lead to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland prime minister has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad correspondence companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads over a narrow friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others, which wait nervous to the next publication, and on the next post documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"she cries away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why would that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havases of some few are used to hide and conceal -- something that we have been discussing and reveal themselves for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appears this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these control points function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult to prosecutions and tax authorities as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably, because it has been no prominent Americans in these revelations in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, after which these tax havens work, Moslca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leaning of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have the connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to find less information in order to establish a company than to obtain a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed staff from school districts to imminate school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheers to turn off particularly vulnerable anchors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an investigating investigator in the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as an African minister to bring suspicious money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone could make suggestions for our investigation as he could transfered his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all predictings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was given to the money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not work for a single lawyer who advocate our covered investigator proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it does not work for a single top politiker, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very comforting, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if it is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I see that a lot started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen foresurges to greater transparency, affecting the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who really stands behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have gathered a bill in both parliaments, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge glimpse into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency to the U.S. and global for greater transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are furious, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotless companies."</seg>
<seg id="93">"managers in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and deploy himself, through laws this kind of intransparency to finish."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I have been abducted once and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a rear sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked upon my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip to the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I don't know. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me saying: "I have an air froze. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" uh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I turned onto the ceiling and thought:" Oh, man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild booths sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, on a tibet on the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art that he had bought from me today is in his classroom. he is now teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were, actually, friends who were waiting for it?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I went to San Francisco, people were normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws from and the rent will be exalted."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can create, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow villagers Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think we could earn something like we could earn. our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded the "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our Cheese ham Omelettes completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and threw the door to the castle, Brian and I joined. "</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" we want to create a website, on the other public pictures of their private rooms, their bedroom, their baths -- the type of rooms that includes doors. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite wildlife to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did it not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still with comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can be found on the things you can well. we were able to designate them."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a sample, which degree we have confidence."</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quiet Anflight of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone, your home is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can't only read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so who has actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you tell Twitter, tell you that he dides for the office of the president?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor could only be presented with his name, if he would have told how he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments which will say: "he can really hold on very well!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-engineered feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given their assessments, before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to ages and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting, when you add the call for a person -- in our case by assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is among the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can therefore help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you're telling about it, such as" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example:" I have problems with my mother, "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, for example" Tolle artwork in your apartment! I make with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount text. we also give tips to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on hope, that the right design can help to overcome our prejudice towards strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we did not reckon, the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">"here, see how many people take care of our offer."</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed parties to be celebrated or homes ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests staying in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all telephone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front front, when trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing limmer than this calls. it's hurting when I just think it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of 123 million people had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people confide in right to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, the miracle process may arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to use heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that save lives, even though they don't know any right."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive a hospital in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">"you can stay longer, without charge the extra-night."</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure cash transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of participation with cash transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but we just call it just" rental industry, "the thing is not just right."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you are traveling today, it is efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"however, what would happen if traveling is a generous buffet from local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place we visited, a group there would be visited to fill a thorough and look at a bar-tour quarters, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you need to learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were able to design apartments for the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thoughts of common shares?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and disotation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in Seoul, Seoul, this project was already begun. many parking places were included in the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"residents are offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people, whose children were moved out. incubators were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be so crazy about how it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the correct design with the inventory of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep root prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that's amazing</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda pass over me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design can not solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppresses, underwear a brain laundering, a terror?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so the media represent the media, which look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagger-fitness-fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practising and spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, Baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual human, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the lust was: at that time there was a feminist independence of independence, and against the pressure I felt as a 17 year old, felt me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have ended with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, and thought in question, doubted, and eventually believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="288">"later on, I married and began as all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the awful morning was in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had ended at the end, looked upon the screen and saw the word" breaking message. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people donate from buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "...,"... in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country was attacked, but in Nu turned me the works of others from a civil war into a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Central West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I drove me -- so deep it went into my seat square, and I was the first time I feared as the Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "be watchful," "be careful," "Be careful in well-lighted contractions," "don't connect to you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, to which Muslims gather to prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" don't go on this first Friday, the mosque might be a target. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandable, as well as I heard of attacks on Muslims, or of people who were made for Muslims, in the free disintegrate of Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branpts on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have the rage of people behind the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to keep himself out of itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, educators and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking places but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"regular visits to a mosque leads to people from other faith tolerant, and show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellars or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalization process has found that it begins online. as a result, the person will be cut off from their congregation, even from her family, so that the person believes the terrorists are true Muslims, and everyone who abhorred their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS justified their brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a man, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would include ourselves in their forearms, when you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you throws a look at her, she doesn't drive what they read in her" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality which they read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had the deposit to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of unrighteousness in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have given their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who had a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and its church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than accuse them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day in our mind of mind?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: if we fear we will pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows: if one reported test persons messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims go down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this was three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to investigate the foundation of a free company that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear will harm us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"at the assignment of collective blame, it is not only about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the most sweetest, more generous person whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him and he showed her his CV. she was blossoms and said:</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been visiting the afternoon, as in a execution where he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">"fanatism cannot only be immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was about to leave America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one that we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, went out my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed us our guests, because half of the assembly were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came to join us but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at that moment, I'm collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you so much.</seg>

<seg id="404">"so, I'm an exception in any way."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for hobby, stands shortly before, to become a billiard business."</seg>

<seg id="409">"before the air-paretzals presented in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting air tools high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"you have learned to carry bursts, to deal with turbulence and react generally on natural law."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility within the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, an autonomous system works, there must be collectively known, where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our labors."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest quality. for example," start "and" land. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called stern starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, which tries to beat two flying with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"contrary to most starters, it can floating, and it has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">Limitation of hedgecutters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn't matter in which position can restore the optimal position and improve the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often constitute basic abstract issues that occurred to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts, together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"before decades, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled flying equipment that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern-ruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanised simplest remote control unit. it was recently invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no grope, hinges and transverse, no further actuator or control surfaces, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so it can fly stable, and can move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant Algorithm of the stern. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood, it is just right to throw it right to me, is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the Monospinner is a exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the Omniter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is equivalent to its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the most amazing ability to offer:"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as he rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propane."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is imaginable in models, the rest will be learned directly when flies."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you assemble them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrucopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, a bit wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half-airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was synthesized synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we took commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine because I would like to use a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types, like us, wages in development and working act lies."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise creatures to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="469">"some 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far away, two black holes surrounded each other in a very far away, so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lightened brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the whole universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time feelings and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"first, we arrange the events at first time."</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell lives were originated in the earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand to us - even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"some 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which arise through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised it as a crazy genius so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometry gravitation-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time the precision of Ligo could significantly increase, which improved its detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, you call him the Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, hard-sensitive issues."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitation of the two colonizations caused black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector too.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my todku father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all this, what I had worked for, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has studied gravitation of black holes and their through observatories such as Ligo measurable signals."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a convent in the sense of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when entering the wave, the space and its total content is stretched into a direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lectures in courses for relativity is often quite alberized dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitation waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each of us stretched the waves, and the stretching of an average people was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nulls after comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo-employee for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would be exactly measured at less than a thousandths of a atomic nucleus. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are massive. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are financially and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"in 1973, Thorne published his success in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott claims, Ligo was more one ear than one eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"that's quite practical. because, you can make a picture or a map of things you can perceive the light around you by several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in killing, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you special:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and level, rhythm and volume, to close the history behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can not make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave pattern in Shall, we can speak the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"gravity of gravitation can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott are very busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very fast, hear the same cirpen with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender of the sound] Jone who knows what he has to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which are about as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine the forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it never was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the everything and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in all, we can see -- practically or in principle -- not to see."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massage stars explode in Supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about this.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes occur in the core, behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon, and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation permeating iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the primitive scarce would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, as the urine is covered by his own impress."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitation waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly, I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"indeed, Ligo found herself in the first approach that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body out of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo makes us a completely different perspective on the events of all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be so bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on Earth and All.</seg>

<seg id="551">Now the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches, my social fear -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," I changed. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain meaning that my life changed, unexpectedly. it began with a matter of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls from inexplicable reasons all" biittens ""</seg>
<seg id="570">"as a waitress, it would be a waitress from the south."</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my cheque."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me whether I could play with her when I was at the leap. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yeah was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life setting in my family. from there I swears to me always with them as soon as you're going to call me. no matter what I am doing, or wherever I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive a lot."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a striking side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" Sagen to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things look forward to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I create television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in large style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for the 70 hours program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each program offers hundreds of jobs, which are not existing before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"one new episode has four days four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes, which are simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my television series work on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"around the world, my series will run in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts, which I create itself, and not only produced, so still obendclean. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans for bonfires and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn round the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes this yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, because I'm a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work as hard, whether you are now a company, a country or a budget, take me seriously when I say that I don't just understand by computer, and it's true when I say: I understand that there is no dreams about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepened into the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is when I set up troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dream one, one of a high sound, gives a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanically, strenuous, inexhausting, funny and undisturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums start in my head, and it grows and grows like an animated street, I could go for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, if I tell them the sums that I don't talk about writing that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work and work with television production, when I started working and working, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summness is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you can't strive differently than according to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not differently to strive to strive to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means an Workbook.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I only want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to put it clear: the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more superior limits, the more things there, the more things, the more things I write history, the more things I write about history, the more expectations."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums that sums the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overflowing, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a only working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "Bibs, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, performed weekends, no penance, nothing delegating, a titanium doesn't sleep, don't give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">"in me, silence was quiet."</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showing Titan;</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so, what do you do when doing what you do, the work you love, suddenly inflatable?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some like:" Heul you, stupid the author Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do it, you do what you're doing to be a teacher, one teacher, one mother, one mother, and knows how to feel the sums, when you know the sums when the sums stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-Kellnerable is a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way outside, late and she says:" mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will already say No, when two things are aware of:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" shame. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "Bibs."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I leave it when I am Titan bin and my sums, and everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">That is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, can't make anything, except to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, watchword pins and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl's in" Die Ice Queen "." "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarcely that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy hub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's silent, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like to know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the workmen, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I say you who I am, using Shows and TV hours, and how does my brain work, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river that comes from the life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, which are to do with the tasks, the expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I am doing this for a fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workman by any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Don't play ansata for me as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what kind of man works better than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"none of them is to be relaxed, none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we are shaved in the garden, before and back, and from."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always invite you to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why did we stop playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say! they always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive for a day of day.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they persist that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Kbiscuit replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad-lap day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no washing, no deposit."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my goodness, my world. you don't have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to feel a place for peace of peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with their own children, it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I will come. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I was abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the piece, why do not indulge for a full 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. sums seem to be returning when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months, a door open in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, she fulfils me and my soul. I'm looking forward to new ideas. I'll use it in full turns and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums that Summs is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summness of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of the work is part of me, but just one part. and so I am so thankful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is my mind that I am a titanium. I have never seen one Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country that I run, the marathon, whom I run, the troops, the noise, the sums, the sums that sums the sums: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more it makes this unusual, beating, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things, I wake up for life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"it belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-help."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was working in functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"for sure, they have heard of one of the most well known, the" deep-cerebral stimulation. "it is implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurologic function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe tremors and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoring of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief physician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that brain traumas and the skull-pressure is inclined at the skull-Hirn-traumata.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you must decrease the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let the cells grow from a tissue, comparable to all small children who are out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive it."</seg>
<seg id="823">This we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François was able to work."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with great green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niotic brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population who looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed for a long time to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebrum-rind cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play an important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the Fötus stage, they care for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then the cells are exactly how it did Jean François Hollande</seg>
<seg id="853">"and afterwards, it can mark colouring to track them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we implanted them at the disposal of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions: what happens if we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routes, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken after some weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they won't leave there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we had an injury to and reimplanted the same cells, and now the cells remained, they grew up to neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we color in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets for a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable skill level, we spent the motor-motor range in motic Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they rejuvenated spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover themselves with plastic brains. they are recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand, they see the monkey, which repeated spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance in front of the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now you see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after maturation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still, to implanted them at people."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how human brain gives us the means to heal himself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know somebody who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely will.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can start clinical studies on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to fill this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikat, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone will come into the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch the authority soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">You have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one must apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a big mistake to look at it as of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant they are in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yev from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy overcomes with us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was incomprehensible to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programmes that have been realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yev or the Communist Party of China, or some of my appealing friends who would have repeated me if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I beg you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup in a mistake, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our host."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"one summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the prohibits savings and corporations that could be anxious where it could be productive, and could also produce all the things that humanity are urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the last 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital are the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore a low total demand for investors who would not invest in which they could kill him that his son would kill him when he is growing,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unwanted to lead the circumstances that kills it, that Ödipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely polluted art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives and develop especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the arms control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy, of course, too many out of --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course, slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake, the job value of athetic democracy due to these connections."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave the right poor, and not only the right to free opinion of expression, but rather important and crucial to them the right to political co-determination with the same abbalances in questions of state defense."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very brightly, it is burned quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our today liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came first, when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was imposed upon policy, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"since that time, in our current democracies there has been since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable battle between the two, while the economy gradually immigrated and escaped."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians do not have more so earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it lies that you can be in the government nowadays, and still not in power, because the power is separated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's like a herd of wild animals that feeds so sustainably the animals, of whom they are nourished, decimated at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far cannibalized, that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations increases, the inequality is growing, the overall economic demand is falling, and the general manager of the corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the successful capitalism had the" demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labor force and the welfare of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have the policy and the economy must be gathered together, and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, besides the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea before 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of Debakel of the Soviet Union should be, that the poor poor should only recover through a miracle as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">"capitalism does it, in which he was replaced by low formwork by automatics and robots."</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be the twin peaks, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so, we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and to make sure that we should democratize the reunited area, otherwise we will appear in a hospital monitoring Hyperautokcracy which will appear in the film" Matrix "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so, the question isn't, whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a Dystopia, similar to which in" "matrix", "is solved, or by something that the society should be used in" Star Trek, "in which machines use their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long talks to the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it mean, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" "matrix" -similar dystopia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in all soon."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please fill up a capital market, where you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues come from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies do not work therein, and employees working there where the company does not belong. no diving between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and spares, and ultimately no run twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: please note that our national currencies would have a freely exchange rate exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to imagine that the whole world trade in this currency is traded -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Kosmos "" -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in front of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you is at the same time liberally, in which they have privileged persons, and martial, because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink in a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You put yourself in your biography itself as liberttible Marxiest.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, the technological development will generate such a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"due to the transmission of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next one, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, why am I a Libertitious Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you do not wirr, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Redner, you have clearly said what you think about the view of the West on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the acceptance of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy does, -- the realm of the economy -- a completely democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain respect, if I may say the so-provokative, China is similar to the UK of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- it's a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to act now, China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells tremendous after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister in Greece's beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I warned that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to self-counterfeit, and denying that a massive rise line through the euro zone continued, and continued to pursue the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek court - the way, the first proposal to deny this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"right to make it right. unfortunately, the powers in the eurozone still have chosen the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries an economic system that is not viable, through political will and Authoritarianism, it might perhaps occur a while, but if the change occurs, he abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change will you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't change the Eurozone if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes made in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Harvest</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims that he did not make mistakes, then that's a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for prolongation of the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the pages of the money to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to fall down our government, but because they didn't want to deal with the shipping tests that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that it was a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"there was none of the Troika of the money, which imposed us this policy, said:" that was a colossaler mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive table of conversations, you seem to be right pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, they will be released to destroy and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we admit ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, which appears to me, it will be as well as for the future of European as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're very wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis: thank you so much for you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"most of Roy's have never heard most of them, although it probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and the content to produce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not select any any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are located right on this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation classification of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bath, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after you saw a season, your brain asks:" where is there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- that's enough to tell you what is going on at that end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to undertake "Toddlers and tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"it turns out more thoughts on the middle balance, the average television - shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing so something, so Roy wants to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of any of these shows, and represents them online where they can see each free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is free for free things, one can intervene, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they don't know that they are watching in watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when you are pauctioned, which parts may be skipped or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data, in order to decide which show them should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and hence the answer is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time there is another manager at another company with data analysis plazed. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly how Roy is he always looking for doing this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to figure out these little details about the viewer: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "receives a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competent, data diversified firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data and it works fine for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision that is met, you should meet a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It's optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least, what you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is something terrifying because we are living in a time in which we take more and more about statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the US and asking for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad, it will decide whether a person is good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there are evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not the fact that a company like Multi-Health Systems do not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data have also been sealed again.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the awful species, to predict -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news message. the success gifted in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the journal" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data can have experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data delights in decisions of life a -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious choices, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have identified several patterns of the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, you will be able to analyze this problem in his individual parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place you put the individual parts together to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to pick and upset."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerfully, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to assemble the parts, then come into a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There's another tool and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, then a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to understand their audience better, why they would not have been able to understand all of these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "that stood not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they were looking for TV-ideas, then called" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "let us tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a ja- or No question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." highly likely "-- exactly this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"later, I'll find it later with a technical demo."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the afternoons."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much wiser than data analysis to make better choices."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball will be smarter and wiser. ultimately, it is to meet the decisions if we want to achieve exceptional at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that it will still be paid to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data, a expert in which you do to do and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, there are not the data but the risks involved in the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
