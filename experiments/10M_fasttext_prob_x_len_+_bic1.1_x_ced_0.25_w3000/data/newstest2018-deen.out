&quot; Munich 1856 : four cards , which change your view to the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where you@@ ths are to meet today .
a mining chapel where the tunnel is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener cultiv@@ ates the cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of coin promotes exciting stories to days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not currently available .
&quot; everyone knows that , who had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than current - but is therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
&quot; then it is clear , as cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mercury area since the 19th century have changed . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ I that is not immediately recognis@@ able as such .
&quot; the large map of map were used for cities and municipalities of more detailed maps , called original composition leaves . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration , between 1810 and 1864 , they jump the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria . &quot;
your Client : Napoleon .
&quot; since the spring of 1800 , the French armies occupied Bavaria since the Second World War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ograph@@ ical recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; finally , when the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a country @-@ covered Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV started the project on the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische Sur@@ vey@@ ing Administration . &quot;
the original composition of Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian Authority .
&quot; the comparison of early / today is , on the example of the state capital , on the most impressive . &quot;
&quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot;
&quot; an example of this is the send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after creation of the map , in 1877 , as the Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses are concentrated in 1856 along the pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is now , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : in the zoom , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the base tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots there are no farmers today , but small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area draws to the north of sub @-@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 on the occasion of the October 19th century , was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
in the jungle @-@ leaf one reads in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street names &quot; at the guest &quot; or from the hill &quot; on the lu@@ gs &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field street , people once seen people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
in 1858 / 59 the Munich @-@ Ireland @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders in 1858 / 59 .
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the facility - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and finished , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has instructed the staff to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; first place for 280 patients , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; sometime , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , you@@ ths meet in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and went into a youth home with training . &quot;
&quot; west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of homes from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co , &quot; built in an architectural re@@ jection to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; in 1856 , the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as a &quot; main square , &quot; the merchants named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the Allied forces killed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof at the time of these days and will take place on 5 April 2017 on the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich &apos;s second S @-@ Bahn train . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ p@@ eg@@ ler , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof hole . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes it@@ iner@@ ary for Missouri
&quot; the National Association for promoting farms has issued a warning for colored people , due to the discri@@ min@@ ating policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ ile , racial @-@ based alleg@@ ations in the entire country , and here it is stated in the statement of the Group . &quot;
&quot; a recently determined law of Missouri , which makes it harder to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who oppos@@ ing the group to publish the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of the civil rights , that will happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped due to their skin color , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard .
it is the first such warning that issued the organisation for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited such inci@@ dents as rac@@ ist contra@@ sts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and tried by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri , which is shown that black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees informed about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people must be willing to bring , whether it che@@ ers , or the relatives know that they are traveling through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Missouri was posted by 100 hate crimes , according to the latest numbers from the FBI &apos;s official report , the FBI in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the it@@ iner@@ ary is also an answer to a new Missouri law , which would become more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued a travel guide for Texas and Arizona , after the United States had adopted immigration authorities to rep@@ aid people for immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U for further pensions . &quot;
&quot; accounts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent years , stakeholders have been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Fem@@ ale project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ acher Wei@@ st@@ aun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac had a picture of the CDU and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac .
representatives of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs from the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted an initial insight into his operation with 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &apos;s milk &quot; is for him the alternative non @-@ market@@ able way for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
at the table of the cottages only comes regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the female voice project as &quot; elem@@ ental important . &quot; &quot;
I cannot be able to act on such steep areas .
&quot; the green @-@ land care for a lot of work , much has to be processed with the tri@@ mmer . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the terms and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ eventh operation and ferti@@ lized this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not perform bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; the leader Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has known the importance of the fence project , and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers have to be supported . &quot;
&quot; you hope , that the view of the surfaces could go out a while still quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and thoughts on how they bring forth their operations , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism
&quot; in 2013 , 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ closure area is 40 hectares , which can &apos;t be for@@ warded until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros was promoted by leader , a district belonging to the municipality of fishing . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they spent 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and ma@@ ids . &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ German Parliament ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg facil@@ it@@ ates the state support of wheat f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r allocated conveyor belt .
&quot; furthermore , the un@@ locking area should not be far@@ able ( hang@@ over over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the request . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 Fis@@ cal Conference in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 km of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans value these equally as any other , therefore the sor@@ row@@ ly staged Saddam Hussein &apos;s attack on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ideology of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he had a symbolic ax@@ e in a hot dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN &apos;s proposals to the dra@@ stic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller doesn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have done it when he had done it .
&quot; but he grab@@ bed their importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to it , when the famous poem was added by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument . &quot;
&quot; Miller A@@ co@@ sta sh@@ im@@ ed : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom that enlighten@@ ed the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you relate later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is just right , but how he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the elabor@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only charge any old immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; &quot; Your desires , your poor , and your poor masses who year@@ ns to breathe freely , and the end of waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ating waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - were very good that they under@@ took a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ism by producing the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
&quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and there is another name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just like Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change it long away from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great cry when Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of the point of perception .
&quot; the great mag@@ nific@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they drew from the exhau@@ stible , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they have to hear . &quot;
&quot; and this is not the perspective , Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wanted to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not shine the way , but hate hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two fle@@ ets were part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world champion is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special in Scotland has to be something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue to figure until we &apos;ll need to figure out , &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the circumstances of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler , who are fought against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; her chapter speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real sense of the E@@ ili@@ ie , naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of silver medal winner , which will compete with its fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it was &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 guns are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which have been reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last year , the middle @-@ h@@ aul Mu@@ ir carries out five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remin@@ ded of her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the man@@ na capitalist states that they are &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also among the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special feature of the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose to something very special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots , who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to get on poets . &quot;
what does my speech relate to chapters ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .
&quot; so , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete there , and it &apos;s just a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
blocking of criticism about Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you can &apos;t use the heating of voters
the father of our land knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the policy up to its political principles . &quot;
he im@@ min@@ ed at the cr@@ iti@@ que .
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we are led as sheep for battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and sold their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ action with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing popular . &quot;
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary stern head .
he has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
&quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful in her , Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters and play@@ ful his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of people who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to as official and of employees who will be paid by public tax @-@ dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments is nothing more than moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or chambers , or h@@ ass@@ ily people who vibr@@ ate online . &quot;
the Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a parish , not a roll . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not benef@@ ited . &quot;
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ ert , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I said polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news releases , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t guess this idea too , if a number of people on the same topic takes place , then they are mis@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a great group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the governor than &quot; concentrated spam attack would be &quot; others probably &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by removing a critic , or a negative comment is deleted . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors and to burn protest@@ ers or protest@@ ers . &quot;
but that just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to crit@@ ici@@ ously critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last was the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they were banned from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky received Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so heavy .
at present Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect as the Internet .
&quot; between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800 . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous dec@@ or .
&quot; the people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Law@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that caused Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ itions that critic@@ ise its position on the contract of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping of shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med its office , according to the historical documents produced by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , opinion of opinion and dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for the next three days in home comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the links to the final year in the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the end of the final year , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his praise with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best site , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he established this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course .
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he has won in his 32 @-@ year career both at European Tour and European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it had won them in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who came to his 50th birthday earlier this year , came back to the European Senior Tour . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Conference in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man out of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it went so far .
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ Captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce , among the six guns on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by Passi@@ v@@ smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking of lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ cancer cases were attributable to passi@@ v@@ ans per year , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , he moved to this issue in 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , 400 lung cancer cases were given for passi@@ v@@ rau@@ ry per year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ an@@ ks prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and are reas@@ onably in time , &quot; says the ladder by Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ect , as it is underground in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is always ob@@ struc@@ ts the construction work , represents a big problem for the st@@ ump of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner they do not use a stove .
they even rarely used a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen bu@@ olle is taken with jeal@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swallowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also carries her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sal@@ ump . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , you were not assigned to the fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
&quot; of course , too late may be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; a existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned back quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which includes control of the region and foreign journalists or legal journalists . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially divided into Papua and west Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as far as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ u@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo sticks , and from corrugated sheets , which were transformed by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian ier did their journey here , sof@@ ter than journalists and practically no fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans sent a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear this clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points on her lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our body . &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and alpha@@ bet rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine of the world , grass mountain , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was reduced by 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua &amp; wood resources are valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these wealth , however , are a source of affliction for Papua that make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a continuous presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
pap@@ acy claims thre@@ aten these golden cand@@ y and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to information of activists , more than 500,000 were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal in the 1970 @-@ 11 years , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year . &quot;
&quot; we Are All Mak@@ ing In A Report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane dating from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and brutal defe@@ ating peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied since pap@@ u@@ as resources bring to an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes , since Muslim economies of the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot;
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ons sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado to serve a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people fight for here .
&quot; the migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua to sell , explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to work in the province of Jay@@ u@@ ura . &quot;
it cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; cost from Papua - their market .
&quot; during his election campaign in 2014 , the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , also known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Papua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann is 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua has changed little , and today the local people feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the rock@@ ed children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers returned to her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their ri@@ vals , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired up in the group &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavily beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building was set on the nearby government commission on the next day . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field before the local police station and the military service center to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they contributed cereb@@ ral hun@@ ches , and led the orph@@ ans dance - in the circle continuously and a bird wat@@ ering - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain . &quot;
some protest@@ ers started to get stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldier was sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E that has not been released to local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and called the amount to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , my left hand was shot suddenly into my left hand , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball from the ranks of the assembled soldiers came from . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and under@@ took his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries a name as many Indonesian ier , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the head of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers only wanted to secure their station , because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we need to defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; said spokesperson on Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came out on the following day &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed in Jay@@ u@@ ura a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he is an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the sett@@ ling of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before long time . &quot;
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said , he has no plans in setting up a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is necessary , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto that accused the UN for crimes against humanity , who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor &apos;s bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have been laid down in Papua , including the pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accounted for such claims with fierce in@@ tox@@ icity .
&quot; I interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear of years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot dead . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the mind that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai is afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting houses have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who was 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
listed vill@@ agers protest@@ ers in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers they re@@ acted by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in close proximity to the hospital , and as the injured persons had been delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I have hid myself two days in my house , &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to address the officers to withdraw the officers and the mobile Brigade of the police to withdraw from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ sting stove for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the stem @-@ related Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ land of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many of the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of Papua New Zealand by dra@@ gs spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; in response to the recent years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is to be expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is the same except range .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially emergency and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a is only 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities must have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in the greater number since the opening of new air gro@@ oves to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that are in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy families . &quot;
Papua have rare the capital or the necessary skills in order to competitive their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation is holding the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media are ten@@ sion@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though the rare permission was given to movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the restrictions on coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attemp@@ ting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ er@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands , the UN Human Rights Council to study the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir proved the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to im@@ itate evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people want to be aware that more foreign governments accept this .
&quot; as a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; in accordance with a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ iss@@ ing , &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a dec@@ eit@@ ful military , is resi@@ due to arm@@ our educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , would consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; guilt &quot; to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and en@@ roll@@ ments , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ed carried out a last symbolic act of Trot@@ z : the bodies of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps there will never be justice to them , but at least they let not forget the persons responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest resi@@ den@@ ces in the world in Dubai its passage and forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ building , which is called by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we have stood at the fire alarm and the scre@@ am of people .
&quot; we ran down the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; told a inhabit@@ ant that named George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooling .
&quot; the government said , working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used questions regarding the safety of materials , which are used in foreign areas of high @-@ buildings around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior clothing for decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of the sl@@ abs to the insulation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des could have died in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen to its big Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the proposed two @-@ third majority are supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classi@@ cs remain in the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the target of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members do not have the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the rate .
&quot; even before the vote , the proposal came to a neutral place after many objec@@ tions to the vote . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon have the host @-@ right next year in the following round .
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training courses , etc , will be facil@@ it@@ ates and the players will have to complete a less official media schedule prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers , forbidden items in the airplane , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flying users found that over 20 percent consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they would have been delayed that they have traveled ir@@ r@@ t@@ ally with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather mis@@ conduct the rules . &quot;
&quot; of the respondents agreed that they tried to fly with something that had been banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which were to@@ wed to T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent said to have wis@@ ely worn with blades by security control while 2,2 percent of female respondents , and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents also confirmed that they have intenti@@ onally banned drugs in the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I had asked trav@@ ellers throughout the country to figure out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ s@@ ware had brought out through the airport security and how many things did . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most common s@@ mu@@ g@@ s@@ ware - knowing or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people often are uns@@ afe which liquids may take it or how much of it .
&quot; so , it &apos;s no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items are prohibited . &quot;
&quot; for a time , people who T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
electric @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives us the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far proved that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their unlimited reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its tri@@ but@@ ted figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k aims to betra@@ y another , less gl@@ ancing number for the first time in announ@@ cing the recent quarters of the first quarter : the cancellations made for the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently recruited more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been withdrawn from the total of 6@@ 3.000 . &quot;
&quot; critics had always pointed out again , that it is only for binding reservations . &quot;
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , spatial mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of so far more than twelve percent of all orders may become a problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with ambitious growth aim is not on demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are expected - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , when Tesla manages to drive its brand new , nor even in practice tested production roads without any major interru@@ pt@@ ing . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the in@@ fusion of reservations may become a problem for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; then the company cannot accept the customer un@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt attracts the rules of Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he had been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , declined his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ induced air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; in P@@ ru@@ itt , P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned the needs of state environmental authorities to re@@ ac@@ tionary faster than previous administration . &quot;
he didn &apos;t mention the complaint against his previous position in a Federal Appeals Court .
&quot; it is a time limit , which ran on 1st October for states to stop the standards of 2015 for bottom @-@ floor o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would not hesitate to avoid any more time to study his authority to study the plan and to prevent their authority in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent ar@@ du@@ ous environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly transferred to blocking , or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden change from Wednesday is the most recent legal return of the P@@ ru@@ ct regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority , as he tried to clari@@ fy the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reducing methane production . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt issued a report on Wednesday evening that his re@@ turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards simply struck the read@@ iness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous desol@@ ation , the EPA often took the dead@@ lines for implementation and then maintained , by activists groups and others , and in an agreement concluded the appointment for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation of trial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that there is us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt carried out his &quot; impair@@ ment to delay and all the other legally available &quot; full of authority to ensure that the rules &quot; is based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the Oz@@ on@@ rules .
&quot; in the last month of approval , the bill should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet to be voted in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the U.S. Coalition led by the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our Kl@@ agen - is an important gain to health and security of these 6.7 million Americans , which are directly affected by Smo@@ ke , who flows directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anting themselves from this powerful place .
rescue and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and pat@@ rons of tum@@ ours .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ ous small od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ ber@@ ian Ur@@ ger book : count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the &quot; &quot; parish church &quot; &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ a and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the certificate of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the most beautiful parish church also a splendid farm , belonged to the church , or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , who are just seen today in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the stunning settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 are under@@ lined these historical cases .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ is originated from the early medieval suit@@ cases .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church , retired and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a parish priest or the bishop to propose a new parish . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the bigger one of the two zer@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was then in 16@@ 92 , but later he had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window frames were stolen and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was un@@ dense .
&quot; in 1796 , French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church . &quot;
they set out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the Church threatened to fall in 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last resting place for the dead in Hör@@ ler . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year 1834 , a storm divided the storm and half collapsed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished . &quot;
only today the tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ her maintain the &quot; creative pension@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite friends and sponsors of tum@@ bl@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade in the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; this is designed by the Kepler High School of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the wording of Kurt Kü@@ bler , Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis . &quot;
the outskirts of the outskirts of Hartmut Rom@@ ann talks the closing word .
the program begins at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 am .
&quot; to execute the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the sha@@ dows of old trees and with wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the promot@@ ers are the fantastic view . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only with dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to the obtain@@ ing of the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ble and sound acade@@ mia . &quot;
&quot; the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ lin@@ ens feel particularly committed to the home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
Association intends to check approval from Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; doesn &apos;t look any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned on the land rat . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aves &quot; has encouraged the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) , its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal to be un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen merely at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal exists a wind force concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy plants are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone also causes a exclusion of wind power generation for the rest of the urban area . &quot;
such zones are to prevent a &quot; spar@@ row &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided few days earlier by a change in the area of wind concentration in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but that was not approved by the Düsseldorf District government . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval procedure is modest , as before the right and therefore rep@@ ented , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the current state of things : the city council determined again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a approval of the district government . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a approval for the construction of wind energy facilities are excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writing have been received since last week at the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a speaker . &quot;
&quot; the circle takes it to the occasion , to re@@ consider the affair . &quot;
&quot; they do not lead to , however , that the procedure will be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a look at the ongoing process of the administrative court , the circle was unable to express itself in content on Thursday at the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , which took part in the city of Vier@@ sen , was closed on lease agreements with the owner of the approx . 65 hectares . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the power demand of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re @-@ wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind energy plant at Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor mo@@ cks together : woman dies at the terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 : 00 on the L 333 between low @-@ fl@@ ashes and soil ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was injured .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained closed over hours .
&quot; after a police report , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman came from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with its passenger car as part of the accompanying vehicle with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to shopping streets .
&quot; as the chairman of the commercial association , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will appreciate the customers that offers its own city away from the usual supermarket commodity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers are planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies will present themselves with their training positions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to be loaded into the &quot; &quot; night Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only on residents of the city and the nearest region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of advertising spots on the radio , internet video and printed bags , which point to the event weekend , says Christian King . &quot;
city Administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
to get the commercial club and the city into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive downtown . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest and selling Sunday , talks with all commercial vehicles and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers to Saturday and the publisher on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customer potential or re @-@ locked customer potential .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many loc@@ als have lost the city centre on shopping .
&quot; at the end , all of them would help to anim@@ ate the city centre - to land@@ lords , all the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it sailed with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which took part in the area , had told the King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , concluded that five Thuring@@ ian cities are participating in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping district &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ lo@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should mark the appreciation of local trade and its importance for the common practice of our cities , so stri@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the action led by the I@@ HK leadership , and with many partners , will also make clear that every citizen can affect his direct surroundings . &quot;
two dead and several injuries to US School
&quot; during construction , there was a gas explo@@ de in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine injured , some of them seriously . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , there was an end in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a person died when a part of a school building collapsed .
&quot; first , a first mis@@ use was also dead later . &quot;
&quot; at the dead , these were employees of the school . &quot;
&quot; as a failure , authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; for the holiday season , few people were held in the building of the Min@@ ne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump made a tran@@ scription on telephone calls from phone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone line with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to tell publicly that he would not pay for a scheduled border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president conf@@ essed him because he den@@ ounced the wall openly . according to report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attempts with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a r@@ ins@@ ist exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the USA refugees to take over &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; bad &quot; &quot; bad &quot; , &quot; bad &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; foolish &quot; &quot; would like to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said the Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford &apos;s massacre : activists lead the rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man middle aged in an imp@@ ec@@ lip@@ suit - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the occup@@ ants are in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ushed the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; the silence is torn in pieces , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience , they cast very real gro@@ wers . &quot;
since 2005 he returned to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted because of the murder .
&quot; it is really irrelevant that in all these years , no one person was arrested , even though we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks who helps in the organization . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gresses of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , the re@@ vocation serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want pro@@ secutions , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get cure and reconciliation , until we receive righteousness . &quot;
a court of jurisdiction puts a bed on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI agents , who received from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding villages have been suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one was indicted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free feet for decades , civil law@@ makers say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : Politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made a decision to give her voice to Georgia for the first time in the summer of Georgia for the first time . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI of the black colour guard Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , during a struggle - report@@ edly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester has slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she bore , was not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , paid a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , thus the FBI . &quot;
&quot; he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin , Murray and George Dor@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; but when they approached the prison , then the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , and Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b approached the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the kill@@ ings and arranged this from a FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in killing , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks puts it even more precise .
&quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed , to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you vote , and if you vote , you will happen this here . &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual desc@@ endant of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; her representation is illustr@@ ative , att@@ acking and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe he doesn &apos;t exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with his ha@@ ss@@ es in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me , or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day pressed nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of Black - in a room and l@@ ur@@ red , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ recorded overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ co since years , but he said that it was never easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story about life , because we would not want to return to those days . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pushed him angry , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a rel@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ ar@@ ming and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ u@@ ck@@ ling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; have said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched , one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there &apos;s the energy in space , a feeling of camera ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ con@@ a says Ras@@ con@@ a , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a dress @-@ dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads an alcoholic Holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks out in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears came out of eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
they have experienced all almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing moisture if Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the murders date have been an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de feels , the air feels committed . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and to inspec@@ t the dead . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ wling to their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mur@@ ing a little boy when he would remember it . &quot;
after a couple of minutes Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x rope and wi@@ pe her tears off .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ pover@@ ished Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished two of his players and breaks up in their poor together ; the emotional load of the performance is finally breaking with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience go together with the actors to dinner together .
&quot; a white pair of Atlanta shows a white pair , excited about the reproduction with a black pair , which they just got to know . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought , therefore , to find words that leave the performance . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to listen to those terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and they do what they look like , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this is really with me , can believe me that the Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called Police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof holds his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring , because it describes the terror of what we suffer , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so , if we do not learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own story , he who knows his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is focusing on a colorful @-@ term production of a giant , six @-@ story back@@ drop . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by road area with the wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from the GDR &apos;s Times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked , in which the Rhine @-@ foolish was pos@@ ing as rock@@ ers , or alternatively an is@@ etta . &quot;
stacked oil subjects remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that attracts by his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ gau - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - as well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , broken in Hollywood man@@ ier one body in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the splendid Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he strikes Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) also must believe in favour .
the audience ow@@ es its ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who ret@@ aining his hands and hands to Merkel @-@ cat@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; great appl@@ ause are there for the festival orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat back in empty leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ Ter@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ous pipe concert in 2013 , and there were five years later , in which the sub@@ du@@ ed &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; . &quot; &quot;
festive ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about that .
&quot; it is noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said just before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it &apos;s also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I prefer a positive res@@ ume .
Max . works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in stone stores in the furniture exchange , once in the week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with that ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young adults , in refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
&quot; amount : I made SL@@ C , SL@@ C . &quot;
&quot; and then a engineer study , let &apos;s say successfully . &quot;
&quot; I know for me that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; make a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning point , perhaps , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , possibly in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual during the volunteer service to have several different locations ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
&quot; anyway , it depends on where you will be FS@@ J . &quot;
you can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partially in the oo@@ gs , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
it was just the right thing for me .
I could recognise my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
differently than in the construction engineer ?
&quot; quantity : well sure , it &apos;s not about to add statistics . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people behind the head , each of which have a completely different story behind . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked up out of the family - one must always go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no touch ang@@ ulation ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
there is a range that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so that life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son seas@@ oned up to 3,000 jobs and t@@ opped the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will build more 3,000 jobs and their intermediate @-@ dividend increase by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure to overcome the company . &quot;

con@@ voy attack of Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; suicide bom@@ bers has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , attacked a soldier of NATO and injured several others . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ters have been viol@@ ated ; NATO shared a declaration of Nato .
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the case of the case in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h . &quot;
&quot; the strikes is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement of NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening was done , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; people carried out by the Afghan army . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all of the injured in a stable state will be treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a big concern for NATO troops in the near Bag@@ ram . &quot;

EPA returns Dec@@ ision to delay the Smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the government regulation of Obama , which the states are obliged to limit the Smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this took place a day after 15 states accused the agency for the step@@ ping . &quot;
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called o@@ zone policy in 2015 and said they show the commitment to the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and hereby we react to our state partner , &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions should be specified , to determine where cuts are made to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay one year to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit filed in Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environmental impacts on the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the back of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions to public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the in@@ hale of air , which contains o@@ zone , contains lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms such as asthma . &quot;
community plans to be shared lounge
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ s decided to establish a joint room in the future senior community . &quot;
&quot; prior to discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lack of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until the church &apos;s church is now owned in the community , but there is no planning event for the project from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the community is pending , such a common room not as a meeting point for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ righteous living area , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision is to be disp@@ osed of by the provision of funds for the current budget in the last autumn , through funding options . &quot;
the building is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint room would be reported as T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the decision of decision can be realized in order to sign@@ alize the investor in this regard , that no dum@@ pl@@ ings must be le@@ aned between the legs - as well as ped@@ o @-@ roof - which reduces the tr@@ ump @-@ height and the construction of economic power - as well as possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this addition . &quot;
if it helps : unanimously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as it is shared .
&quot; Daniela call refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one is not so far ahead , it is now looking forward to the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard to do so . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it looks behind a covered sub@@ sid@@ y on sole property or foreign investors .
&quot; this is not just the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a supplement , but get a true , in doubt in doubt , the anti@@ thesis is . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ate motion requ@@ est@@ ing the decisions appropri@@ ately , find three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; so with two opponents of the original program , Stefan H@@ aller will summar@@ ises so : &quot; if we make the decision so we make a huge step , make a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official performance of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows that qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;

to wan@@ der Stern star in the Har@@ z
&quot; in the Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; shall be created . &quot;
this is planning the club ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet @-@ planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star @-@ path &quot; come to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ men , called it . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set along the planned route tables and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase of 2018 , the association is planning to be able to reach five to six places in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; en@@ quiries would come to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , brown , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tablets should be completed by the Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception is a role in the site selection .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star Train station will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experience a lot of knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; convey@@ s also convey@@ ed , in which constellation is an selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest shooting in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site of Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often there are out of the dairy road and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy with naked eye .
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , since 2003 , there has been a somewhat similar to the initiative of the funding initiative Planet@@ arium Göttingen , like the planned star rating . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet track asc@@ ends up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ markt ( municipality ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the poles with individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end - are exactly positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a bul@@ let of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to is needed for eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star but would last half a year .
&quot; Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ official World Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Champion , which went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organisation Super @-@ fe@@ at @-@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through a unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions @-@ World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; he stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How is it to you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 19 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair of photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Garcia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
&quot; and he must move on a lightweight be@@ ler &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot;
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut in this year to arrange a date with a 135 pound debut in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell , on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans have asked after him , &quot; &quot; Garcia and pushed herself back later , on the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when are they ready ... &quot;
&quot; he said he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he possibly will participate in his Saturday battle . &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he &apos;s thinking the Thir@@ ty Champion Champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; very slowly but I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Off .
&quot; it said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the moment@@ um , that built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work in it , &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighter and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four injuries to tire plat@@ ters
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured during an accident on the A7 . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the supply of the market , probably after a ty@@ re @-@ placed control of its vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car ran to the right to the ar@@ tery , where he ski@@ pped himself and then stayed on the roof in the cru@@ ises . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the transfer service , A7 towards the north was closed towards the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left hand could pass by the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , allowing the optimization of def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first seasonal game , Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , would not be the two counter at 2 : 2 against Bruns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; these were two areas too much , and we have to watch in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the rotation chain shall also be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a violent cl@@ ash , the Fort@@ una don &apos;t want to get out more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be so that nobody can imagine any more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also get better after the experiences in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the square chain . &quot;
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is sure that &quot; &quot; because we are able to build on the half positions on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann . &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; requirement is , but that we are still better harmon@@ ise , and we do not afford such a lot of ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e , to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you want to speak after a mis@@ chief start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could indeed be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can focus on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start to the season I took only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ cles , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be broken down because of a temp@@ est . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann said that players from Au@@ e might even be something new , because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against entering the bone . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests come from the Rhineland as a slight favorite on Sunday at the meeting ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we throw them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is quite positive only against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no team in the 2 . Bundesliga , which one has to propose from the out@@ set , explains Fort@@ un@@ as principal coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel wants to see his players on Sunday definitely .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ er tests published
&quot; the recent findings of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people were older than 18 years . but not everyone believes the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ri@@ ts@@ ar@@ in@@ al@@ wi@@ et ) started the tests of tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum proceedings , they should be more precise to assess the ages after the Swedish migration authority ( mig@@ r@@ ations res@@ et ) for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , which were less years old . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations sent out 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency estimates that the person was possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly is under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly growing during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases where the person was evaluated more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers were lied over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that it was 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet found out the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said frank@@ ly that she will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical research assessment , at X @-@ ray photos and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by bra@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus , the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they walked earlier or later than usual by the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
&quot; assess the biological age of this way , is very un@@ reliable . &quot;
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we should not do it as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of testing : &quot; in general you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is in@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the largest risk is in it if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven ton heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Buil@@ der department at the department of road and traffic in the government department Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , works at the same time began at all three renov@@ ate bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the tim@@ etable is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a cloud bridge from concrete , lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , on Wednesday morning , has a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge valve . &quot;
&quot; this is a boundary , which is used as a operating track . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge is set to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is scheduled .
&quot; the special thing is that it concerns finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with patented glasses .
special finger@@ tips has the laying of pipes through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass @-@ fiber cable , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building site and the collective in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; construction works on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher Bridge is the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the costs for the three bridge events amounts to 700 000 euros . &quot;
it is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
&quot; it does not occur so often that parties will go to a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else can be found under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the fac@@ ulty of Vol@@ cano ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a wide alliance , which shows peac@@ efully for this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell calls for a &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ ges forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already in front of the event before the event will not want to listen to Af@@ D dealers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , president of the Forums One World and one of the dimension@@ ed organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have covered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it also shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D volcanic fish he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked her first in Dau@@ n , but there was a retri@@ eval because of the already made Laur@@ enti@@ us church there is not enough parking spaces . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with view to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; that &apos;s the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is what it does : at 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , several speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ pillar , Af@@ D @-@ Chairman Uwe Boy . &quot;
&quot; in the audit@@ orium there are about 200 listeners that are waiting for the top edge of the Bundestag for the general election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police remains unchanged , but the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the site have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can turn off - no particular benefits .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and they will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart was completely open to her bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I bite to grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was those of their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues , Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately crossed bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette of performing brun@@ ette compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously treated in any love which I updated . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten gave to the fact that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; I always lived in du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or ob@@ struc@@ ts .
I never liked it not to be taken seriously .
&quot; according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school time she &apos;d rather disgu@@ ised like a book : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a book . &quot;
I felt really att@@ acking and ashamed and ashamed .
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t love to love their love : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; you may call me some as und@@ ank@@ le , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers , and tell you ... today I will not help you as a inhabit@@ ant of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump , previously , had a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t get the Democratic candidate of Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; according to Forbes , the Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Forbes states that he has a coal store in five states , and has inherited a carbon business from his father . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party who would have more likely to work for us to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 government agreements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice , only the last re@@ jection of a party that is from the top to bottom without a guided tour , the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for D@@ oping scandal
&quot; the world leader in athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , blessed on Thursday that he described as apparent exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping scandal but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Athletics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ actic ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics World Championships that the meeting of his country was correct from the sport and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; he told him , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes who were cut off with competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was voted for maintaining the ban , which was executed in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times , and everything is possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
CO@@ E said he was &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we must do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the Athletics World Championships , which will start Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden train@@ ers are still free and said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
a funeral for a funeral service in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service at Nord@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , approximately 1,000 people of the two have been in a helicopter bom@@ ber in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety measures .
&quot; at the still un@@ clari@@ fied crash , Secretary of Defense Minister Ursula and the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing . &quot;
but they called the two killed pilots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner &apos;s profession . &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
&quot; the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief H@@ be@@ headed from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday , a week ago in the West African Mali . &quot;
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead end of the Bundes@@ wehr in Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , we first took to leave the church in the church . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral in the circle of the family , eng@@ aging friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began . &quot;
there were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the Secretary @-@ General of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
vines laid down ro@@ ses that stood in arm in arm to the coff@@ ins .
&quot; in front of the Church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
Defence Minister from the Le@@ yen described the inver@@ ted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and a sat@@ a .
&quot; the Chief H@@ be@@ headed was built in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regim@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , said to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , there was none to be mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali was not a minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he was also of high importance &quot; for a country where we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot;
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the Dom@@ kil@@ de church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen was agree with the decision of her husband called it further in communication .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not give intention to join in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ ones of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired to retirement , and he also puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and the function he wanted to see himself from his wife not as equal , not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish kingdom . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not understand the intention of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his future wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew over , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his just 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik took over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ust instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ gue , which I have smoking instead of Virginia tobacco and the hier@@ arch@@ ande to be the reputation which could not be the brand of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I couldn &apos;t hope in sight . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were equal to two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ elect new elections
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re@@ election of the land , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the parliamentary resolution of the Parliament spoke out . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the country &apos;s official election the red @-@ green coalition lost their tight @-@ vote in Parliament to the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP opposition .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets established their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ en@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction to record them .
&quot; the CDU and F@@ DP had a total of 69 seats in the lower sax@@ onian parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular at the 14th of January .
Th@@ ous@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether it could rain in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil , however , is holding it for indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides quickly as quickly as its self @-@ resolution solution . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state version also sees the possibility that the Council of Ministers will withdraw the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers multiple options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally tested properly , &quot; said Th@@ ous@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all questions , if they are legally binding . &quot;
Th@@ ous@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but a little cur@@ ius . &quot;
the political scientist myself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
they described themselves as a app@@ endi@@ ary of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the left @-@ off@@ s dep@@ uties on the return of their land @-@ day .
&quot; we naturally assume that they received their land @-@ day , which has received it over the green state @-@ list , with immediate effect , the state leaders Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have consci@@ ously decided to lead no foreign language in the group .
&quot; even in front of the background that there was no content differences , we cannot leave this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the overthrow of the Lower Saxony @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the conduct of former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of Socialists and Democrats on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , re@@ comp@@ elled the country day quickly . &quot;
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the political scientist , &quot; in her last erup@@ tion and in their fr@@ ust , their personal interests in front of the country , &quot; crit@@ ici@@ zed SPD Secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ate game , and tried to beat a political capital . &quot;
political leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ous@@ ler wants to recommend its members to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CDU .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets before , with personal career opportunities showing the outcome of the 2013 country &apos;s election . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was the strongest force at that time before the SPD , SPD and Green in the land , but a very thin majority of a voice . &quot;
&quot; interview in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from pois@@ oning , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses over contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
agriculture minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect eggs from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .@@ de@@ .de , the states provide the latest information about the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all we know , an health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister does not really be perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately opened immediately and has been found since announ@@ cements in Germany &apos;s close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk evaluation are available to consumers .
&quot; the trade has the same as the producers to worry , that the sold @-@ selling products and health are un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if the resi@@ sti@@ ffer resi@@ sts of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time does not blame to blame .
are manufacturing plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after completion of the knowledge , the production plants do not meet immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies must be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to mut@@ ually illegal practices . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are little monitoring in the harvest . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or even on the conclu@@ ding jurisdiction ?
&quot; it was just the official controls , which have uncovered the process . &quot;
&quot; however , for truth , food fraud and criminal energy may never be reduced to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consistent information about such happening and hand@@ over to the state bar in the cases where off@@ ences can be found , of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made several times clear , that I expected from the responsible authorities an in@@ accurate enlighten@@ ment . &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; consumers , consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and transport food@@ stuffs . &quot;
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are dis@@ ru@@ pted . &quot;
&quot; by the pan@@ eling means , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation , which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ supplier animals is not acceptable , and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be consistently worked with high @-@ pressure on all levels .
&quot; I expect of all relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is sc@@ aled and un@@ resolved . &quot;
how to move the financial rules of the football on Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars to Paris to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent im@@ itated issues of European football matches , Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , because the leading organization , which supervised the European game , has power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , which were launched by UEFA UEFA in 2011 , means that PS@@ G has to prove some point that the transfer of Ne@@ y@@ mar has been financed without a great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ lians from his contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose with safety , making ne@@ y@@ mar signs and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy rich Herr@@ scher@@ familie of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to purchase a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be transported with legitim@@ ate income sources , which allow the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P has been conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini , after its election to the UEFA President in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs who had enormous debts in their quest to success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in when banks or owners moved their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P abandoned from the concentration to the liabilities of clubs on the supervision of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich was originally purchased in 2003 in Chelsea , and then invested heavily in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P transfer period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take a loss of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and even though Plat@@ ini is fallen from the presidency in Un@@ g@@ nade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to get rid of excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead , and we will intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ de@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G pays the buy @-@ out cl@@ a@@ ws of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invoice about the duration of his contract . &quot;
Ne@@ y@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , PS@@ G has taken together with Abu Dhabi that is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million , and it was arranged to be limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season . &quot;
&quot; the UEFA is looking for clubs , who could try to over@@ list its financial statements by extending their income through companies that are associated with owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cataly@@ tic company could lead the PS@@ G sponsor@@ ship , if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not apply as a legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; that happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship of PSA by Qatar Tourism Authority was blo@@ wn out . &quot;
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar could come across payments of the Organ@@ iz@@ ations Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that Ne@@ y@@ mar World Cup ambassador will be simply to find out a serious man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regulatory authorities . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA will be more attentive to handle the rules every attempt . &quot;
&quot; the UEFA had no pre @-@ preparing talks with PS@@ G via Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars Transfer , announ@@ cer on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were unable to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot processes . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and she tried to prevent new@@ ly@@ m@@ ars , claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; fin@@ anci@@ ful d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to Kat@@ ars , last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservation by La League against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play , because you may have different ways or have different interests if a country has a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; in the past years , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the collabor@@ ative collaboration with a possible end : the airline writes the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p was confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA made an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Europe &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; approximately 17 million small scra@@ per pla@@ ques of 14 grams are distributed each year , the flight companion prior to landing on the passengers . &quot;
Swiss does not want to do any information about the cost .
&quot; industry insi@@ sts value the order volume according to &quot; &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the promotional effect : for a g@@ og@@ gi@@ ate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants in the new call , Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y the Swiss . &quot;
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss producers come . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer is not reachable for a statement . &quot;
chocolate bars spread the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
&quot; before Swiss Life completed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , first led Swiss on two and a half years with the start of collaboration with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long h@@ aul flights , customers of the First Class with treats are spo@@ iled by Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gl@@ i , in Business Class n@@ ags by Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , distributed in Economy Class , is also distributed in Economy Class . &quot;

and there is another crazy plot in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ oting ) that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes great fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ alli@@ on sub@@ li@@ pp@@ art of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on Camp Andy feels like an old Kn@@ ack@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches this as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will see the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds you of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ West Ring I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas . a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard otten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some beautiful days to see ( the police force the time to check chess in television , as Americans may do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Op@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ athe Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda war - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reagan mask is included - that it is often like a single one .
&quot; with six long episodes , it moves away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , which has been re@@ dig@@ ged on a lower length , could always deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always wanted to visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is still occupied by two thick men who devour a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a g@@ age .
the fic@@ tive Romanian creator isn &apos;t wrong : we make it even with our own younger history and with it .
blow against drugs Mafia in the country
the police have been a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar County , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office was held on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , fifteen years of age and 77 were arrested and issued warran@@ ts for arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officers provided greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same raid in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
German arrest warran@@ ts were issued against the two susp@@ ects .
therefore the two are probably extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
&quot; the members of the Mafia is accused of drug discrimination , severe violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office against organised drug traff@@ icking in the South German room has been determined . &quot;
&quot; between the State Bar in Constance and Palermo , a re@@ actor exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the big use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the vision of the tests , Italian nationals met with the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident occurred on May 27 in hip , where several shots were fired at the early morning , likely to go to the band account . &quot;
g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register pro@@ claim large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens who shouldn &apos;t appear there : &quot; according to a report , the fore@@ igner regi@@ sters in Germany has significant defects . &quot;
lead to partially engraved error decisions at asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the representative for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has attentive to a media report . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; in part of the failure , &quot; warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; is located . &quot;
&quot; according to the register , there are ten million people with foreign nationals , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 have been found in individual cases , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and in the register doesn &apos;t matter any more . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data input can significantly slow back@@ drop processes , according to the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on trav@@ ail@@ out human beings , EU citizens are captured that would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such false statements led &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on the handling of exclusion , &quot; that is , therefore , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started to reg@@ ain refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children after Italy , when they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this go forth from an internal paper of the Federal Government for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ er Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is therefore , the B@@ AM@@ F perform such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , except for babies and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under references to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreements , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to first reach them . &quot;
&quot; when mig@@ rant travels into another EU country , this state can reg@@ ain him back in the country . &quot;
&quot; for reasons , the ministry is writing : &quot; meanwhile , the entrance capacity for families with min@@ ors children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy has given accommodation for inclusion and accommodation of families &apos;s guarantee .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these additives .
other EU countries would also send refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; internal policy spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ pping due to defects in the Italian asylum system in human rights conditions and a companion of childhood . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in a total of 220 liters of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood @-@ turning service provided for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; with the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule was leading over 50 litres of blood with its meanwhile 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council will don@@ ate multiple will@@ ingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant , as our body is designed for it and we declare the don@@ ors that their blood are available for foreigners , nor specifically for foreigners , under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood@@ stream helps several people , &quot; explained the leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the con@@ serv@@ ings are crushed into its components . &quot;
&quot; so , three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported of the actions that will be carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donations . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theater began to pay for a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; already before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ bra@@ ins have been awarded the multi @-@ prop@@ elled blood don@@ ors for 50 years . &quot;
&quot; half so many missed Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Rie@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter ten times a 500 milli@@ liter of their li@@ king juice . &quot;
the Bank of England is holding interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and economic growth of inflation have been pushed over a rise .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; will remain , when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a ampli@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with this month fewer members have an increase , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 , that pressure on household income would continue to continue , with inflation in the fall is expected to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they have sign@@ alized that interest rates would be necessary in the next years to cur@@ b the inflation of inflation , and said that the loan costs may expect more than expected to rise to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members agreed to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut economy , which was issued prior to a year after Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will require time for the financial plan to provide budget for banks , although it was now expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with a total of 115 billions of Po@@ unds Sterling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real@@ ities of households continue to consumption consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; is needed for cooling down inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent , than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; gradually , &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank forecast down@@ ward growth forecasts for this and next year , as compared to the forecast in May , 1.9 % and 1.7 % were projected . &quot;
it has maintained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the pound fell by these messages from the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; the decision to no change occurs after the most recent dis@@ appointing growth figures increased significantly , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and low salary increase , as the exac@@ erb@@ ation is even worse before they will improve . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy could not prevent the revenue in the next few years , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three year forecast will be &quot; to recover . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consumer expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes to a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ king .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until the prices and the economy will completely reach .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final judgment , the call was increased after a interest rate , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ stressed households with three political decision makers in July an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and put it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that its aims in relation to their target of 2 % would be &quot; wholly in the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ agne , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter decline of s@@ wap rate the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the credit@@ ors would look strong according to businesses and the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market especially looks good for those who run existing de@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should be controversial HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ itional &quot; HIV prevalence of HIV in September after a fight against the funding of the drug against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ fabri@@ cated pre@@ fabri@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk at high risk positions by around 86 percent , now is delivered by health care about a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared himself ready to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court , according to what the N@@ HS had decided to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities were to finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess train was announced on Thursday of N@@ HS England Chef Simon Stev@@ ens , as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to be eligible for registration of people and other hospitals will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ fabri@@ cated hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV @-@ preparations taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection .
&quot; Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that there is enough medication in the body of a person , to prevent HIV infection . &quot;
such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come to the treatment in question include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners that were not successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified by suitable participants identified by the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status cannot be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
&quot; people who are living in England and registered with a dent@@ ist , can also apply for a possible participation in their local sex clinic . &quot;
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of the medication in this week after an international competition pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical evidence , as it is used in large scale targeted , taken and implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this big new intervention should complement the extensive and increasingly successful efforts for the prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of persistent progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted on needy and dangerous people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner which leads to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terror Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is rapidly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was developed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , Sha@@ dows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and delayed realization by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ forming this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the Adv@@ ant@@ ages of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV @-@ infected , and that they contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed their bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; I have loved me in love , and made a offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a w@@ asted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architects and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create a 12.5 feet high ceilings to create a home not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking , to solve the order . &quot;
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms to arrange so that they were being stacked , without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; it was not only to build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function , or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us look down over the gl@@ am@@ orous lounge area .
&quot; gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make it longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room . &quot;
at the entrance offer mir@@ ro@@ red units for all the best and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen , if it is not used . &quot;
&quot; fol@@ dable kitchens , nothing new . &quot;
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ ast reinforced , fear@@ less MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite , so it is when you push the door high , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agents will occur , and a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials to make the space for its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into electrical plug sockets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; they are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square met@@ a of something standard@@ ly into something very unusual .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide to leave this . &quot;
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business assets are to be broken . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ frontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth of more than half a billion dollars , and since the family in 1973 bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city rum , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father Colin - from Paul , as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is described , about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court states that this means Colin &apos;s property has worth $ 316 million and Paul in worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a Pro@@ bl@@ emp@@ point for Paul .
&quot; the emergence of Colin proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best objects , in 2015 he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , after several failed inter@@ medi@@ aries took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; the brothers also fight for control over the existing business - which Colin , as Paul claims to have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this was not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firm . &quot;
wife De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early 1970s a business in Bruns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the safety to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in Colin the first je@@ ans@@ shop of the family . &quot;
Colin tells us that he began to be West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years the High School was when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted to land his brothers in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , Colin claims that Mark would have paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; as a mark of Luke as well as Mark , Paul says &quot; on the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Colin has kept herself back very , though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers contact .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to complain , and to go to our family name through the courts , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he was still looking for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the dishes , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restri@@ ct the media resistance to the president .
others have tried it and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of news media - in hope to hold the boss on a more moderate course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , joined his first working day with senior employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he would like to repair any poor information that went into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in brie@@ f@@ ings - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have attempted to t@@ aming Tr@@ ump by controlling his media coverage . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ ump was off@@ ended because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince a fair adviser to Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against the POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officers to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter is ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign leaders know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ et could not contain any more spark .
we will probably never experience something about twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
&quot; his collabor@@ ators already managed to keep it away from him , then their efforts were worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently preventing it to cause Tr@@ ump Kon@@ tro@@ ver@@ sen .
&quot; a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material , which may improve their views from the world . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , the president of strategic reasons desper@@ ate information . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press clips , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sted out to find out what these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone was accused of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Commander of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was banned from Twitter to be banned from Twitter , or that he has sold no concrete evidence or has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump read the article , and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
ma@@ stered Dis@@ crimin@@ als receive Post of Europ@@ ol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all Europe shipped this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the flight .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ crimin@@ als are not known , not@@ ices from the population will be hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
&quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday of the promotion , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent Calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many volatile holiday destinations hide , called it by Europ@@ ol . &quot;
I have put 21 postcards to requested crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online audience could have been arrested , at least eleven of them were sent to release on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate on a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owner of West Mid@@ lands are back with some more closed trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , which have negotiated a field before their Manor houses . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army out of transport after they were deported only in May , without being deported from one of the excav@@ ation excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , saying that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; They were moved on Monday evening after they were sent away by Bentley Heath , where they have cast stones onto the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be comp@@ elled by Sch@@ am on the implementation in fact , as it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , and are moved back now . &quot;
&quot; yesterday evening on , probably more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to get around by doing long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my community &apos;s share if the Council can &apos;t stop it once .
&quot; an natives who would not be called , said : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just seen the last round of this trav@@ ellers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary legal steps , so they can go as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our behaviour collection , it is very important that many residents notify an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture from the situation in which the court must check , when we put our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is born .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
that &apos;s good news for the city .
&quot; because with closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the then ambi@@ ance of Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the 13th of April 2014 , there were about 30 000 nights per year , and has also been revenues through the local fee . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , there was a dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees that came across the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up an construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time in the community .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and said then by serious applicants in the house .
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ero with Managing Director , Birgit Sch@@ erer , headquartered in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter Ob@@ ject .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing a longer period of construction containers before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear how extensive renov@@ ations are planned . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn apart , pil@@ low ceilings to be destroyed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are fitted with large walk showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , there are new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; beautiful &quot; close &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , you could not move on an elevated city level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , a broad outline , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men are supposed to feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the performances of the city are almost identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; external systems are also brought to fore@@ man , which is clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace that is open to the restaurant that is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us @-@ Special @-@ medi@@ ator sets a Grand Jury
&quot; in Russia &apos;s affair for U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , a special Grand Jury , Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the panel has recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under calling to the cause confi@@ dential . &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; the CNN reported that , in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , the oldest son and a Russian lawyer already reported . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer to have targeted at the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were disp@@ utes between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the Washington Post , &quot; wrote a few weeks ago , that the Special Representative Tr@@ ump personally got into the center and find the accus@@ ation , whether the President may have disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys , however , is to examine and decide if charges shall be charged . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called count of count .
&quot; mostly , they are turned on if there are larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite persons to the hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the transmitter , CNN had already been issued in order to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and Head @-@ ohn J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking about their discussion . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the one show that mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not be promised that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic gives the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that they can speak . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement he knows nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
&quot; however , these work usually work in the hearing , also emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ate any measures that accelerated the work of the special interest on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
&quot; the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times , that it was not determined against the president . &quot;
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has been changed , called it in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this root , accus@@ ations were made against Tr@@ ump , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him about an investigation of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is standing under large pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to a presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special interest and its employees . &quot;
that dissolved spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of Congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , a position in which he returned to President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller holds a position in which he could be fired on the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties would like to prevent such a step .
&quot; on Thursday , two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators placed the draft decisions on Thursday , after which the custom @-@ no@@ isse@@ ur could not be so easy to put away . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice mountain drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic has solved a gigantic ice mountain of the scar@@ c@@ ely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres big col@@ oss now run to the north and will probably be two , three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice cre@@ ators registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people either .
&quot; as a result of climate change , climate change played a role in the crash of the iron , is un@@ clear after research . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual mer@@ ges in the region around 30 years , the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) is in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
one of the broken col@@ oring was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lipse .
sha@@ king flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aciers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lipse is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this valley was distur@@ bed the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt@@ ing some years ago .
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes about a complete shame .
&quot; there are some things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bow is in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron sla@@ b stand under tension and could be disin@@ teg@@ rate , in case of a key place . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and water so much water , as it yields after the melt itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the scar@@ ce leads to the gl@@ aciers directly into the sea and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small extent , writes the British research project to observation the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lipse is the fourth largest in Antar@@ c@@ tica for A@@ WI - with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural place and is not aware of direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists it would be controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eventh will again grow again and possibly coinci@@ ding , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if this researchers will not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice age to climate change , so many ice @-@ c@@ ud@@ dle of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are disin@@ teg@@ rate in recent decades . &quot;
this long run@@ off of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; to decline , the temperature increase was contributed . &quot;
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have passed around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ aming the areas in which the temperature at the fastest sti@@ ff .
CDU wants to go to the staff
&quot; because it becomes more difficult to fill @-@ free jobs , the CDU calls on the CDU , to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; once again , 17 apprentices have their first working day behind him . &quot;
the doctors in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
&quot; in this year , some 620 applications were to be recorded for this year . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the circle still lack personnel to tackle the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are 50 non @-@ occupied jobs while the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CDU would now want to take hold on the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG &apos;s leadership and to the field of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wish of the parties , the administration is to work as a concept for personnel planning and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not just short @-@ term constra@@ ints on skilled workers , but are looking forward to counter@@ act the candidate &apos;s candidates . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself from inside and outside , to show specific measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , call CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds even after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know sooner .
other cities are good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is given by a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease , or age @-@ condition@@ ers comes from the service . &quot;
so that &apos;s the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , the leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint request by his party . &quot;
he already looked at the cra@@ yon day for a very thick surprise when he posed the personnel cost @-@ covering publicly in question and the rest of the parties involved .
&quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked , which enable an exit from the municipal employers association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come short term to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should aim with the unions - perhaps in collaboration with the county @-@ related cities - perhaps people . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CDU , the employees and the officials to pay better than pay the rate of tari@@ ffs for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you changes in a higher level that orient@@ ates itself in employment years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms were forced to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law . &quot;
not least through the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers this coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to the NGO &apos;s Mig@@ rants &apos; rescue
&quot; in Italy , NGOs have warned the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue to continue their operations on their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working &quot; , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German charity organization &apos; Youth Save &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that the illegal immigration was lighten@@ ed .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself on exec@@ uting the Italian territory of Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all the alleg@@ ations which are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Save &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that its crew is delivered to mig@@ rant migrants to them directly from men &apos;s hands , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one of these meetings had supposedly found only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Act of State , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation will be suspected to take over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves to take away . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board that monitored their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have previously been prepared to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS of Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they would have no &quot; essential amendments or Dis@@ abilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants coming to Italy in the last weeks would have been severely de@@ posed that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with the local Citi@@ zen Fru@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ ge and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in Wach@@ enheim in the Northern Germany to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out as a good base for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ alls of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
&quot; the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ des@@ heim region , above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; there were viewing points , partly on door@@ men , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ besie@@ ged levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were more and more advanced for the long Tri@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s festival . &quot;
&quot; again , look@@ out look@@ out at the view@@ point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wery &quot; tri@@ als and moderate growth . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many alt@@ itudes were announced again . &quot;
&quot; castles , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and villages brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ ker covered the bi@@ kers in the neutral content of healing Sole . &quot;
Neustadt has also been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest by its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - league supplies for e @-@ sport
&quot; the sports stars in future are sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than running through wind and weather over the stadium @-@ scre@@ ams ? &quot;
&quot; fact : E @-@ Sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business , great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal lig@@ oc@@ aver@@ al , which are increasingly committed in this area . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of July 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 , and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid @-@ July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that on this train yet several clubs are asc@@ ending .
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Trade Union organiz@@ es FIFA World Cup at the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers compete for different clubs . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the e @-@ sport .
Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football team has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people are still going to go into the stadium in the future , says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : societies tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ Sport@@ s@@ men , you could not be present online far more often on these markets than once in the year , to send Asia to Asia . &quot;
how is it exactly ?
&quot; the E @-@ Sport will play computer games like &quot; &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Simulation FIFA at the Competition level . &quot;
&quot; long as in normal sport , Li@@ gen @-@ established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the year 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is absolutely essential . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bers has long been dealt with the question too .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports Institute in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions displaying also in classical sports - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , cogn@@ itive skills , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast responsi@@ veness . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only take care of the console , but also exercise their bodies and attention to the nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the itte player is a good player , too . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping will always be a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are hard @-@ se@@ duc@@ ed in online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports . &quot;
the scientists estimate the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are internationally active internationally , which is like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural inhibit@@ or . &quot;
a study of management consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales should be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , write the del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
many countries are already continuing .
&quot; great markets are Asia and the U.S. , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Competition Uni@@ ver@@ n .
&quot; even in Europe , some things are doing . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; according to D@@ utt , the Netherlands and France are now obliged to host an e @-@ sport department according to D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany goes back , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia , and to clari@@ fy the old times , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore , to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company will host the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alised world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , p@@ ushing out Conrad Roy for suicide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been abandoned on par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in June 2014 , Carter was condemned to death on the killing of Conrad Roy who had committed suicide on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ just east .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a creamy bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , folded with folded hands and down@@ wards , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions were killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the State lawyer . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ver lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regre@@ t@@ fully regre@@ t@@ fully .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he didn &apos;t find that their &quot; age or irrit@@ ation or even their spirits have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a state prosecutor read an explanation by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I have not drunk the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us to be for his sisters , it is in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; that she would never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person who I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep my life for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 by a carbon oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after car@@ ters reveal text messages that she encour@@ ages him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging up , spring of a building , ste@@ ad@@ ly yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide they wrote , &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you have to do is to turn the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter looked attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of murder on her British co @-@ lived in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; in the Los Angeles Times , Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ved compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern mar@@ ries the Con@@ scientious Cup winner a big season with extra motivation .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself divided into his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner went back , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry would have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the character of the coach could also suggest K@@ imm@@ i as well .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen out of youth toys , de@@ but@@ ants and just chosen by the professional C @-@ El@@ f professionals , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed to those who prefer to give a lot more to those who want to keep you with mood . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to compete in Lah@@ ore &apos;s legacy , a small extra motivation can only be used . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field . &quot;
&quot; behind the rear , this is now its position , the white bin@@ ds at the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start formation such as the one that can take advantage of the rest in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , attempted to direct the un@@ u@@ ed tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had a view for the whole while many others were busy himself .
&quot; V@@ idal makes his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , come out to the services of the Asia trip ( fol@@ ks too ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le not to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this worked out very well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both agile confident . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ic triumph@@ ant of Nap@@ oli was frequently heavy , moreover , Sü@@ le tried to get a few times a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was &quot; &quot; not so , as we did this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary achievement at the Debut .
&quot; I was also brought to this style : &quot; for this style , I also brought it up . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ usual , this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the re@@ funds , one saw in the course of the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y was not one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ i passed after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in his back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going down here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; at Bavaria , you just need to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not teach the New Testament . &quot;

company pleased with Rhineland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic ministers : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic Minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows after more than a year , in which the new economic minister Volker knowledge ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ ame the old Minister at the same time .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , president of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge is att@@ acking the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al turn@@ around Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the bridge of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country up to top .
&quot; this year , the Ministry of Planning is hoping for the construction of planning to 2021 . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ walk Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ road map . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take off the circuit in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ als Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional but internationally competing businesses .
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aimed at the wine of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I have an open ear for people who want to establish a company &apos;s own company , pra@@ ises I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the Trier &apos;s Chamber of Appeal in Trier looks an additional inc@@ entive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro for the stud@@ ded master examination and 2500 euro is provided , when graduates within ten years after the master training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; on the planned road construction would be easy to create facts , at the same time it failed to the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to set the knowledge of mobility with mobility , only 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; on the basis of calculations of the b@@ room on the basis of the b@@ room , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 , more than 20 million euros less in receipt of the country roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to solve the field of skilled professionals in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the old broadband construction in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
ex @-@ economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power business Pro Wind .

Audi will change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ator confron@@ ts itself with counter@@ action
&quot; one day before the Audi announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said that the company is the mind that &quot; there is intelligent options as chassis limits , &quot; and be@@ ating itself to European cities , including Munich where BMW is based on diesel vehicles or restri@@ cting diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there are three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules of carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines , are considered to be carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of diesel @-@ powered exhaust gases , also accept what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful car companies and to ignore any signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switching devices that could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put into trial in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi had been involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused Audi to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that concentrated on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation , Volkswagen is difficult to load : the luxury car manufacturer carries out disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to the gain of Volkswagen . &quot;

&quot; the Is@@ ar visitor also takes part in this way , a raft came from Munich on the morning of Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; who goes on Saturday again to Is@@ ar , who will see a big raft there between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ Bridge . &quot;

the start to a public opinion campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitor .
with the motto &quot; true love is ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is sharp@@ ened to the amount of wild .
&quot; in the last summer , the raft came across the Is@@ ar and also this year , there are further actions and measures to achieve a promising and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los cre@@ ases and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons drawing to his figures .
the Argent@@ inian also shows the Argentin@@ ean film with 85 .
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he acted as an artist for lucky tickets - what was fru@@ str@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris in the late &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the publication of his cartoon in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
&quot; again , the artists were inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures stri@@ pped in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he also s@@ add@@ led his own data today , still on the drawing day , working every day almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; over calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches are still finding a lot of spreading worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los fav@@ oured animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ ght@@ li@@ fter than counter@@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that is to come to the cinema text in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; therefore he sets more on the TV series , which is how its original drawings are produced . &quot;
lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lavender is due to the conditions of drought remin@@ ders conditions and due to the diseases transmitted insects , which scientists and farmers that try to find solutions , big head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf , and with very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
&quot; lavender oil is not just for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also asked for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also the spra@@ ying mix of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ür@@ cher R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1,200 th anniversary this year .

&quot; conv@@ ey , ignition , tra@@ ders , vag@@ ant or an agricultural store should be able to experience this days in the city center . &quot;
the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; normally , on Wed@@ nes@@ days , the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet in Wed@@ nes@@ days to examine their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organizing crime , corrupt officials and non @-@ hearing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children with the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or they leave at home in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , ally . &quot;
&quot; you ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; there are drug ad@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand at the beh@@ est list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto gave up his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editors and inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is deeply connected , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , that shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; T @-@ Shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a member of the Pro@@ secution were established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only had two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders , who are connected every year with drug traff@@ icking and organized crime , the journalists were only seldom tried in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is still a tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting concerning the discussion of safety is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid , time to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we know not the things , we mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was shot down from his car and was shot at him , probably because of the name of the paper - who was translated with &quot; twel@@ fth River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to wan@@ der freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on Val@@ dez &apos;s theme there is virtually nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in January last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to become one of the bloody slaughter fields in the country , because ri@@ val@@ ing fra@@ ctions have been fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the street are shot , or that the cemetery is full of dist@@ ressed , two @-@ storey Maus@@ oleum for drugs that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; for a minute , forget that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce , with the blame for his friend to protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a rival time in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have off@@ ended the sons , the gang@@ sters bought each copy of the output when she was extra@@ d@@ ited to newspaper c@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force , after the decision of another newspaper , which had published the same story , the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican force against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 USD in hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; at the time , the newspaper served a call for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters loved it , hard to publish investigation without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead them . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you need to assume the task which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the case of many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak @-@ bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ er worker , the friend , who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always sit in El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , was his love to routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot;
&quot; his death , too , has forced her to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do the best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways and landing ways . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ time and self @-@ maintaining . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ ances .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , not just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no cell phones were permitted . days previously announced that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used exclusively for governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
&quot; they were commissioned by the regional government , to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ sized building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of police officers , who called the governor himself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug had come under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce has blocked three main layers . &quot;
&quot; it was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a . &quot;
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the State expend@@ itu@@ res , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about how it was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the ruling institution@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orters to write about previous events in this local restaurant , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man had escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed resource for the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had already known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body structure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communic@@ ating with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office has become a storage room for signs and stick@@ ers that prot@@ ested against the murders of journalists , because the staff had become something that they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
reporter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez made a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration by another journalist on the Office of the Prosecutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more powerful as they have written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; for walking and construction . &quot;
&quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to explo@@ it journalists and they will cause them to have told the truth . &quot;
she has therefore asked that she was once again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organized crime , involved in the government officials and a valid corporation . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters not only killed by drug abuse , but also on orders of politicians and security forces working with organized crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks against journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die , because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note , which was supposedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones besides their separated head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do such as El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug card with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home country or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives the drug traff@@ icking to him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was rep@@ orters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ s . &quot;
a number of shooting paintings with band@@ ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate how it was promised by a number of ant@@ it@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ ri@@ stone wall , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the folded founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if he was murdered on the same day that Javier was murdered , the practition@@ er asked me to send them on the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used tar@@ ry to sof@@ ten his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; now researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received , experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that it could even determine that his created skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said they had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; called him as &quot; the sp@@ atter@@ ned din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period from 110 million to 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that it was &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; to flour@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the pan@@ ni@@ zed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was located on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , green . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossil discovered the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of Earth &apos;s heavy Earth . &quot;
&quot; after all of these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled . &quot;
&quot; if you only fl@@ ashing a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs models - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers found out that this plant @-@ fres@@ ser , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably resem@@ bles a convertible tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ vo@@ res din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide before car@@ ers , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique that is used as counter @-@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been permitted to mix better into its surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts , what suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made headlines in May , and has now been seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; researchers have studied the wild animal and studied at Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ c Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of scales and arm@@ aments about his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ frontation , a common defence method in the animal , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ ization is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeding the animals of today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution has benef@@ ited the wear of con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the counter @-@ sha@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or gir@@ dle - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than prey , which is sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong bre@@ aded din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ dents of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous must have been &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales , also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r @-@ brown was red . &quot;
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on its life , including the fourth Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , came into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as South @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably have a lot more popular than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ cre@@ ted skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of the beast . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only feel a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted from some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this is the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes heavier . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in Current Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after the death of the sea and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the living @-@ held din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from sn@@ out to the hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that pushed back from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ ni@@ zed plant @-@ e@@ aters was w@@ asted by the western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater flow of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin condition still cover hol@@ low @-@ pri@@ ge tank panels along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , it is such a level of conservation so rare as a profit in l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; remains the remains of the skin , still cover the hol@@ y@@ fish plates that carry the skull of the beast . &quot;
his right front foot is located on his side . his five fingers crossed upward .
I can count the she@@ ds at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ ers@@ li@@ de , and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age , some 20 people were injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information of the police were against 17.00 hrs . between the connections , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , in@@ hib@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no data on the exact number of injured persons . &quot;
&quot; it uses mild to moderate injuries , said a pol@@ lu@@ cent pre@@ cher . &quot;
a large out@@ lay of lif@@ egu@@ ards was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in Munich .
&quot; in the tri@@ cycle of Munich , a round of ten kilometres was formed . &quot;
&quot; like a AZ reporter , it came also on the way to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire brig@@ ade recorded the identification number of the vehicle , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , another accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car supp@@ orter and a passenger car .
a rescue driver was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
&quot; comes the Schaff@@ ner , w@@ akes up an uns@@ ur@@ ion or breaks off from the workflow from the workflow . &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the tim@@ eless ticket control .
simply confirm by phone that you have taken his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; when the offer comes , we expand it out . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of the year to many more remote traffic routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in , &quot; calls the railway to the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what do most passengers do already .
&quot; it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator &apos;s app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and last one needs a seat space .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one gets up to the train , calling the ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button on the electronic release appears . &quot;
the train conductor get a message on their mobile devices that driving g@@ ast X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat .
&quot; the train conductor is available at number Y &apos;s ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger car with already more profitable online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for customers , one for the rail , which is to use the passengers again . &quot;
&quot; anyone who wants to travel without ticket control by our train att@@ endant , check in the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time on the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB Remote traffic . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs .
&quot; who is often rail@@ ways , knows that in addition to delay and acci@@ dental trains , the ticket controls are one of the biggest troubles . &quot;
&quot; in any case , one of the trav@@ ellers do not need any documents in any case you need to de@@ valuation online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or identity card or else a document must be found .
&quot; the result are endless discussions between train conductor and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or large space and del@@ ays at the control of their own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end time takes care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ r on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police killed just a 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , and it was there . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
&quot; she switched her mobile phone to Twe@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive , later on the evening . &quot;
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a rebelli@@ ous dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , dis@@ bur@@ sed another polic@@ eman and cried , saying , &quot; I will all kill you ... &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remin@@ ded their testimony . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and which we can typically call . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that they would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love , and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of people living in community living and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , they possessed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered that which she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
&quot; it has to know , and to see it in it . &quot;
&quot; it needs to be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have lucky enough to give her a experience in which they personally experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove you a bad service to keep it far away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police administration , which became the activists on the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business partner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of acti@@ vism for Fer@@ rell shape began to accept .
&quot; my acti@@ vism changed after the 9th of August , she said , not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association and concentrated on Ess@@ ence @-@ justice and health qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it all has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors . &quot;
&quot; fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted only &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question occurred Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often from the white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their votes and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; following the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , which is known for his acti@@ vism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct @-@ Ins@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought to the project closer , along with six other loc@@ als , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; followed ? &quot; in the years after the Bro@@ wns sequence . &quot;
this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are presented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but around a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life , as she loves herself and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be a certain extent in this work , and in the realisation of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founder of the movement , which had influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as a gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting at different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice , that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , even though it was at the front of the front , because at a life in these cru@@ ises than a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the r@@ er@@ ical connections between the community and the police remain . &quot;
&quot; Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years , due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration . &quot;
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she kl@@ ert themselves at a song and she feels obliged to this memory , since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on for three years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains .
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss the bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the Bit Gallery moves the people , even though it is not built yet long . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone is out@@ dated since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the theme is hardly any one . &quot;
the subject is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
&quot; while the one to the Bit Gallery : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) , or &quot; This is really great &quot; ( Nicole rock@@ ing ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ing ) or completely simple : &quot; &quot; size ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates are designed to build more customers in the city , of which the other business also benefit , fear the opponent , that then the pedestrian street is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; furthermore : the gallery is planned on the plot , on which the peas@@ ant market stands , in which 13 direct their products will offer . &quot;
the construction work will conclude with the start of the construction work .
&quot; the Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a Square , with the opportunity to sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; Simone Rooms : &quot; &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm were always happy . &quot;
we have discovered the but@@ cher for us too .
&quot; we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of rent . &quot;
the new project should probably not be low in the new project .
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s your shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , Dro@@ ger@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; of that , there is already enough in our city . &quot;
&quot; however , you see how many charges there are empty - some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle will remain at least . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered here is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ able . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only from larger companies because they are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores , there is almost no more and what is left still , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmers market stand during the construction time ?
&quot; old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even at duration , when the bit gallery actually comes in fact . &quot;
or will it be able to drive back all the shops from Bit@@ burg in advance ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not going to work .
&quot; one shopping center , which stands empty , does not need any one . &quot;
&quot; according to my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peas@@ ant hall it is thanks to the mad guy - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no room anymore .
&quot; when the farmers market is captured , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown that are almost invisible , that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen tubes and hair sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st condemned a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly acknowledged diplomatic news on the site of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline agreed in technology , computer science , and art , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his position . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , by algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , created by Mann@@ ing , could not only look like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , such as someone can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , such as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has been openly spoken about the identification as a woman in 2013 , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is deliberately stuck on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ ine Per@@ ch - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just returned from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the artist portrait of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic Ar@@ te@@ facts produced like cig@@ ars and che@@ wing gum , extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if they wanted to do a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were un@@ equal to un@@ equal letters that took over several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; they created even one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ orted Images , &quot; which would be predicted to see a future in which the President Chel@@ iv@@ a verdict would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; Obama actually was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings was given the release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of happ@@ ily meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to resolve the rigid column which he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked by a strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things were going to happen in a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one of the gallery of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with her superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is an end of the &quot; automatic shred@@ der , their foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ ght@@ ful of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kle@@ ot@@ en@@ oids following the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take care of it is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s the 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a hands @-@ free @-@ ef@@ on in the hands of the United States , such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , then they won . &quot;
&quot; so , never just the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet them from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ ose , if I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition even in person - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks which are summar@@ ized like hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; that was also aimed at all , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ ers were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like the Chelsea , like the movement that was even behind their liberation . &quot;
&quot; Professor of the University of North@@ western , and an employee of the University of Oxford &quot;
&quot; a nationwide man @-@ hunt is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which was chosen as susp@@ ects , after a man was sto@@ cked in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of its alleged involvement in Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acquisition of the National Court of Cook County .
&quot; documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , passed after several styles . &quot;
&quot; a warning warning system , published by the Chicago police office , revealed that the ly@@ che was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ectives the bul@@ lock as murder , while the police is active after the two susp@@ ects , civil servants . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been in judgement and had been excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University are collabor@@ ating with this investigation , &quot; &quot; Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail statement , a spokes@@ man of the university and the Cos@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are willing to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens were sho@@ cked and want to be sho@@ cked .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to establish the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help you find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip that had just happening in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el@@ ly .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear , whether the incident happened on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim , and resear@@ ched a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for rest@@ oring the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA driver has been updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA , which describes the criteria for recovery of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything for Russia to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the reported results from the WA@@ DA approved survey by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly accept government sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we introduce the study by , since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has put an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no government programs , and we won &apos;t admit anything that exists . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ k@@ os spoke words to those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales program R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v problems gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report has controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled in November 2015 as part of D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia .
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the main quarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs more
this divided the corporate groups .
&quot; there is a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could continue to be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it said in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative at fi@@ f@@ ical anti @-@ domestic appliances . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
&quot; start @-@ ups that will help your company , not to become next u@@ ber &quot;
Amy is willing to measure good luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls did not work .
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ ei@@ cally . &quot;
&quot; even when you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; she said , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed . &quot;
she called people from the outside .
&quot; the human resources start @-@ ups is a new race of the human resources start @-@ ups , in order to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; through creation and licens@@ ing of software that has a specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , they will offer companies , surveys , supporting groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ n allow to contact the C @-@ Suite managers and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nice , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; she also said that she had a better insight into what your employees think , and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows a look , which units have the most complaints , and which managers have low allow@@ ances results - so you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; however , companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not have the next u@@ ber that has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who describes a blog post in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ments to those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could possess more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the midst of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ everything . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company lets you send a customized &quot; pulse &quot; p@@ olls , collecting confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that can report to the employee &apos;s behavior .
&quot; and when the main executive manager is involved , complaints are direct to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public opinion cap@@ tures the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his employees are badly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience valuable consequences by consumers boy@@ cott , workers @-@ airlines and Kl@@ agen@@ das , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent for more than a year has been used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was seriously taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ cent sets out , problems that were previously identified by managers who were in offices in cities or countries were hi@@ des - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unnecessary practition@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; experts began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of eth@@ ic violations of the Enron scandal , Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to her right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; prior to use technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and boo@@ sts the company with recur@@ ring fees for use their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the venture capital investors , which supports both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ t received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his whole funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than to date . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assign@@ ments . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel that the work that you do is worth , and then feel more strongly committed to make this company successfully , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites if their portfolio companies are well underway . businesses are well @-@ employed when employees are engaged and involved .
&quot; if the Analytics tools promise third , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance . &quot;
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; but the data is us@@ eless , if the administrator of a company does not take measures . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees to your feedback , it may have an anticip@@ ation that changes is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees cannot motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re asking 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company too much for collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; If you really belong to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I take ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who leads now monthly employee surveys , was able to lead action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation is . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise new teams within the company &apos;s decision and quality of communication , to develop several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights over the employees , and it hopes that for a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is well @-@ known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it runs at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new training fields of the team in the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are registered at the Summer Courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their conclu@@ sive tests before they return at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center next morning . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real t@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the full @-@ packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise of the two days is more than a day , in which the brood moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , six playing times in West@@ wood are practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; they should hold on the course of August 18 , 20 prior to the beginning of the formal game preparations for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the control change of the N@@ CAA , even if they add a further point of the player &apos;s routes . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous burden three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just crossed it , they plac@@ ements themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will stop her practice as soon as the camp is finished , what is the clear sight of its fields from a neighbouring car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , which has already been submitted to a door@@ step behind a door@@ step , which will not be a slight task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ ins are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can rent a room and then set there to draw up a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and practice , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security services there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best thing we have .
I am not so worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook aims to send more potential articles with counterfeit reports by third parties and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible counterfeit detection and send them to fact that may show results from the fact inspection from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has become a major political subject in Europe , with French voters to be flooded with false stories in advance of the presidential elections in May and Germany if they do not succeed to eliminate social media networks as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that was launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany to test a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realisation , which stories of fac@@ tions passed by the third parties , people want to meet and share what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; link &quot; &quot; and to other changes to its news feed to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a si@@ p@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has grown 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says , &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; surrounded the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he thought un@@ expect@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; I only wrote on the thum@@ b pressure on the page of a letter so re@@ acted , who worked from a double assistant in the 1700 &apos;s , he says for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; that is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck !
&quot; and letters still smell as smoke , because a fire was kind@@ led because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as it would be even there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is sm@@ itten so with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months have lived in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this would be too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; castle to study the archives and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ary hy@@ m@@ heads of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape @-@ care , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was given the full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ a , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ l it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what he possessed : &quot; you could mean that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go away ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to place a bro@@ ader basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar which occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant arose in this area and I thought , a insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are linked together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , the family of Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , presented in the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell dating from the 18th century , filled his own funeral , filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only dug out later than his Sar@@ g was dug out ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be a real g@@ aun@@ er again , making money back and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men extingu@@ ishes their school crises by giving rich old women - I put them as a he@@ ap of good looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise inheritance . &quot;

campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ ian Chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the ret@@ ali@@ ation of the 301 year old Mary @-@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF want to keep the logo and his marketing team by Nelson Art@@ z . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , the campaign will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of Aktion since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on her yesterday &apos;s un@@ locked website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make clear , that some is better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are sure that we are very comfortable for the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city . &quot;

&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a sing@@ ular promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique experience . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the City Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the Army
&quot; every year , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over retirement schemes and convey@@ ings in the Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of Ministers of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice Premier@@ s , and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
thus civilians were in the Y@@ as last year .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ ro@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdo@@ gan is a wire p@@ ush@@ an . &quot;
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people , who have been involved immediately at the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara for this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to make the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army in handle ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there is a settlement of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among others in the lifting of the head ban for solo@@ ists , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big man@@ tle at the army and the security forces is going on .
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan made a further 73@@ 95 government operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed up the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als are earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they lowered three times under calling for their role as a gu@@ ardian of the world leaders . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least at calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan run specifically an Islam@@ isation of armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a nam@@ eless officer called &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; warned for asylum in fear of persecution abroad , and the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the NATO cannot let the Nato cold . &quot;
&quot; in the alliance , there is a doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army . &quot;
the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stri@@ cter rules for visa permits and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the Cham@@ bers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and will do billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the way to change the way citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have English speaking to support the financial resources to help themselves and show knowledge that are getting good in our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry plans to renov@@ ate the race shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the race transportation of the race car had been fought - now it is due to go fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , the tourist trail is expected to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race transportation from the long @-@ term , they should start construction work on the road in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ racing platform , the country ad@@ mits himself most important for the tourism important connection , &quot; explained traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the repair of the track , it transported to about 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; of this sum , the country exceeded 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , become final tuned , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen Railway as operators are already involved in the technical details .
&quot; the road@@ map , the vehicles and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; thus , the race car shuttle should be ordered from December 2017 . &quot;
the pav@@ ement shuttle is a popular rail link between the train stations of Il@@ men@@ au and the platform .
&quot; in the past few months , during a pilot operation , the distance of sufficient many people was used to order to restore them back in the future . &quot;
the route is also strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought that in 2017 it cannot be more crazy , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start their ascension seriously . &quot;
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot to select its form of ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the company deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners to robots , which feels warm , that feels warm - with aware of human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot accordingly to its belie@@ fs &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
but there will be even more worried because many robots would have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look like a step@@ ford @-@ woman of progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with silicon .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adjust its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they will find appe@@ ti@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of ti@@ mid@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her mood , quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ ris@@ ome aspects of this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ sist@@ ent female properties , the anom@@ al@@ ings on rape , when one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , quiet a most important one . &quot;
&quot; on his website , true true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for males . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men have no root xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just a different sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement point to a little dar@@ ker and low tide in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality within a desire to sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men do not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their rising popularity , they still remain temporary at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but something from the boundary zones can be le@@ ak@@ ened in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , be very educational . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until the free market applies to this . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are immer@@ sed in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House present an president to have attacked women with sexual attack . &quot;
the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images that works dev@@ ours bodies and the out@@ stretched eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the aim behind this sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their builders , they want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots are not real women . &quot;
you cannot separate or go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , which could affect independence , or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination . &quot;
other words expressed : they are counterfeit slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human beings
&quot; it has become a ties of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political spl@@ its , which have polarized the U.S. voters , have also split families in the small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Harvest Festival in the USA , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ elected relatives . &quot;
we were very strict to let us burst all the filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less not@@ ices have been noticed , bringing the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families . &quot;
&quot; I will mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ wing poet that lives in Chicago and has long visited the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she remin@@ ded me that unity may have a mighty power against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship , having fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls in another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ty way that we will no longer be able to rep@@ ay his M@@ itt@@ ens of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still dis@@ sol@@ der@@ ous long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which appeared in comparison to its standards suddenly as a ep@@ it@@ ome of contamination . &quot;
&quot; I find me today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the re@@ im@@ ed - the dog on the car roof , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my cousin in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ wal@@ let of New Yorker &apos;s park department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enor@@ m@@ ously big , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals rotate to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ per@@ ing music . this is a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a town dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just a fair . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I was still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage , the topics @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park Kar@@ us@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ he years can go and have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked about it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; in this week , my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; on a scale of up to five stars before I managed my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also practices pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no needed is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used during which I made tired of the experience to suff@@ ice my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to the hospital with breast pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten at the hospital , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal by the State Pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of the Valentine &apos;s early morning , by taking them several times by door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria for her . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der which was hidden in the cabin .
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it was too dense . &quot;
&quot; the national prosecution authority , said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objec@@ tion could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ kl@@ ands of feeding and scre@@ ech@@ el@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the continuing schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the aband@@ oning students continue to secondary school , four on the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , Dr. Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted his parents and representatives from the public in the village of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students who chose four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des chose a young eagle that grows in chicken yard , but then put into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower she@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken cycl@@ one came out a small eagle .
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken cut off from him , the eag@@ les spread out its wings on a high mountain apart . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes shown three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank showed a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder wore the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for the integration , the director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte said . &quot;
&quot; the young was different than other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
&quot; to be free , it is to be free . &quot;
they wanted each fourth look that he feels gladly in his new school .
&quot; it followed Dan@@ kes@@ word to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who once again jumps with lessons , and the parents represented . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ill @-@ time was over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher announced . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students only very much for two years , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the quad@@ r@@ allies . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students had a song from summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
the new school year have already been registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the emission behaviour of the Euro 5 emission standard for Euro 5 and partial Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new promotion oblig@@ atory ?
&quot; no , the released software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates are valid only for vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their re@@ armament has ordered the Federal Chancell@@ ery of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced an ag@@ gregate implementation in the next few months , but not yet named an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write every person .
&quot; if it is due to an inspection , that will be done in its frame . &quot;
how long will the conver@@ sions go down altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin writes . &quot;
the links from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily do not act the car manufacturers on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time elabor@@ ate cannot be an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive discounts on Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fear that .
but in the regions where passengers are threatening .
&quot; in rural areas , there is no value @-@ loss for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for a sale .

we do the city !
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ aker , dates back to retirement in the next year . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ aker is . &quot;
and the work still makes it great fun as he convey@@ s in the press conference .
&quot; he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that await his success@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the application is ad@@ mi@@ red to date . &quot;
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or engineer .
&quot; thus , under cont@@ emp@@ t of regular termination periods - there is still enough time for a development . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts for the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant must show appropriate statements . &quot;
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they could no longer fill this , they would have to travel the citizens to consultation until Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the near is the city and it itself important , W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years of office , some important projects have accumulated and looking back to the che@@ ers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we do the city of lively , &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Netherlands parking space are attached . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ etic bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium @-@ restoration is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will beat some 1.5 million euros in the latter alone , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker is estimated . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is known for a Stadt@@ bau@@ d big game space .
with ha@@ l@@ ach@@ s in its own building yard and gar@@ dening could be flexi@@ bly acted on multi@@ ples .
&quot; you can move a lot , so che@@ ers , and the design of green spaces will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the schei@@ d town master st@@ resses . &quot;
the Stadt@@ bau@@ master wearing high responsibility .
&quot; he is builder , &quot; at the end it runs all over my table . &quot;
&quot; for assistance and coordination , he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in existence for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified himself with the spot . &quot;
&quot; because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , it should have completed studies as a university engineer or Bachelor with technical device architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; mining and civil engineering , building planning , basic planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ ies , administration of urban Lie@@ gen@@ cies , urban farm with building yard and city hus@@ band@@ men , as well as sub@@ e construction authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines : closed in the south route
&quot; according to the police , previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track to the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were badly damaged that the her@@ ent freight train was needed .
investig@@ ators go from two male judges and are looking for them for the night hours .
close to the crime was observed by witnesses a ro@@ dless roller and a bike drivers had been observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y struggle , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves in danger and also the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage at the L@@ ok and the system , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , the rail customer may also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokes@@ man said of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be run without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people attended Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight controls did not seem , however , they were delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced by some 200 metres . &quot;
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , in the United States , affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ edings , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during the victims usually come to relie@@ ve meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found drugs to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immun@@ ity in the gut is pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide themselves in food not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to dissolve inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is incl@@ ined towards inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a kind of tolerance convey@@ ing immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium into their inn@@ ards . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had it from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition toler@@ ate , less inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases , if the same system is working with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral prizes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan sought out a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as they found that a group of study powers had such cells , but a different group of the same family that was separated from them . &quot;
&quot; it thought that the difference was to do with the gut micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacter@@ ium species found in mice , but were missing with the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were tu@@ cked in a ster@@ ile environment so that they had l@@ acked a gut micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria accounted for the immune system , the researchers sent L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then resulted in small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant conveyor cells .
&quot; when the active component has been cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a side @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ism known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ dicapped were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant conveyor cells , such as mice , and that most of us would protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells in humans like in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ dicapped values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
&quot; in Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; signed , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes his debut on Wednesday evening at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the Chelsea Po@@ und &apos;s 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last winter season , before the UEFA Super Cup starts at Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressive in the H@@ age role as people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve at the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him earlier than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho will be the start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed that week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three other new oblig@@ atory targets , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority . &quot;
&quot; three of them get , I thank you the club , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they gave great effort . &quot;
Boeing @-@ painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lens in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state in Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such ads previously .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new civil war for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , as the wind revol@@ ves : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the president of the Prime Minister always looked at a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; just no stor@@ ks from the party centre , just no head@@ wind out of the covenant - so the most important desire of the fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz takes the party , the fundamental change has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , it would not be described with counter@@ head@@ winds . &quot;
there were deep strikes .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU is a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Green Party . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green is simply not reliable , &quot; said CDU Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the surprising fra@@ ction@@ ality of a Green Party , over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the country code , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Party executive manager Michael Kell@@ ner promp@@ ted the revol@@ ting down Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear deteri@@ oration of voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and the electoral struggle of the Gre@@ ens Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , however , it sigh@@ s a SPD electoral soldier , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ ox reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing after the battle of the green MPs El@@ ke T@@ ests to CDU without their own government . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD provincial associations .
and nobody knows what next comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , calm down the comra@@ des of stone . &quot;
&quot; according to the State elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the dive , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite moved the party to smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks later , comra@@ des in the weeks later moved back . &quot;
&quot; then , when she had just created new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next stop was .
&quot; Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city . &quot;
&quot; and because in the crisis communication , he then made pretty everything wrong , what one can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
&quot; now also Stephan Weil , too . &quot;
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust gas aff@@ ection and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony @-@ Prime Minister already has been in criticism since longer . &quot;
mi@@ ese det@@ erg@@ ents were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to put more strongly in the covenant of Ak@@ z@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; during the former mayor &apos;s former mayor of Hannover , his power in Berlin , comra@@ des remained not hid as a comra@@ de in Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
&quot; they sent him , because they spoke of because of a stabil@@ isation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , because at the partial age of the lower sax@@ onian Gre@@ ens there is no fault . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; sometimes , comra@@ des stri@@ ve to stri@@ ve to keep their own rows closed . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is addressed to the Green Party , and above all on the in@@ tr@@ y par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in the life@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democr@@ at , like Mrs. T@@ ying its own career opportunities on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , leader of the party in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; woman T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected because of its person as a direct can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , but on the state @-@ list of the Dutch Green Party . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ained a &quot; democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters for the voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Dutch SPD as a leader in the Bundestag election , R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career perspectives of a future CDU MPs reject the election results , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more ongoing commitment of the CDU Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to renov@@ ate his home in the years can soon receive support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had a look at the scene once again . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there has been in Emp@@ fingen san@@ itation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only include new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on 4 April , the Court of Government Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a san@@ itation zone III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funding amount to 8@@ 33 333 Euro , equivalent to 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the community of Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
how is a san@@ itation zone now ?
&quot; you will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; it also play a role , whether in the planned area of all interest , to san@@ e . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territorial limits could then move again . &quot;
&quot; the ste@@ g appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which frames would then be carried out . &quot;
core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of Inn@@ u@@ sts to improve the living and work conditions and obtain@@ ing the infrastructure .
&quot; the measures would be objec@@ tion@@ ed , that means per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as stat@@ ute .
&quot; the auth@@ orization period for funding is run until January 1 , 2017 . until April 30 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the inventory will only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ vocation should be made possible , so that in the next year the ben@@ z@@ ations may be started . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every Commun@@ e had to perform the discuss Vor@@ ab investigation . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore to evaluate the urban confusion , and decide how to be rehabil@@ itated and in what extent will . &quot;
it will also be entered into the basic book for the respective land .
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to the Emp@@ fingen and make themselves a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized that a major success factor for the project was the participation of the shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow Quest@@ ion@@ na@@ ire is the &quot; Building and Property ar@@ c , &quot; in which it comes to the construction condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and residential bogen , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
the blue &quot; arch &quot; is only to fill out if the building is operated in the building .
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ hen@@ ce@@ forth pointed out that a filling questionnaire was not a request for funding . &quot;
new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ized that the distribution of the convey@@ ors after the &quot; wind @-@ dog principle &quot; works - who first comes first .
one could not reserve any funding for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make the presence of a renovation . &quot;
British inventor herself puts a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand@@ movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open its door and can even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thet@@ ist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant process is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of North@@ am wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising cost of the white house cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which resulted in the American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the President on board is the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American buildings . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials from the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck was exhibited in Connecticut . &quot;
&quot; the White House of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of that because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to its predecessor , Deputy Commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message was shown that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 a.m. , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original air crew was during the helicopter during the helicopter , while security personnel remained on the ground at the ground . &quot;
&quot; out of the TIM@@ E records , recordings went not clear whether a second flight of flight was required . &quot;
the Hatch Act provides Federal State to use government property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we set was if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Commander . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was named by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; on the event , the president gave a violation of reform of the reform that was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but your use only for a photo intervention is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation into the investigation as the presidential plane in front of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about using the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Commander of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn , to add the US President at the White House with precision met@@ ers@@ . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercise . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted in the training need of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden to other acquis@@ itions , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved , to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ing drawings for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to the US Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D revenue rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is only 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of the estimates for delivery rates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study of 2015 , the recru@@ itment rates for Do@@ D do not include the personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the operation of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things which are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have ti@@ rel@@ essly worked . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is reasonable to emphas@@ ize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ ven@@ ed with the helicopter as he entered his tour about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire . &quot;
&quot; at the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ ited with the media about its own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three thereof . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top Re@@ action of the Second Tennis division joins the championship third of the S@@ V standings .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 : 00 h in Kiel .
&quot; despite five games still mak@@ el@@ os@@ er balance sheet , the top re@@ union of the Second Tennis division received the sense to reality . &quot;
team@@ leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay gave respect for respect to the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; at the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability , S@@ V provides the imports from the high North . &quot;
&quot; the Danish and Finn@@ s can even point to missions in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view on Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s how it &apos;s hard for us .
&quot; you need a good portion , too . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high north is practically there .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ 4 .
&quot; at the moment , at the moment of the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella , French@@ man does not play for the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will play for his first deployment in this season . &quot;
so far un@@ defeated Chil@@ d@@ lip@@ nik Castillo came yesterday with the white rus@@ sian An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ sky at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should also be in Kiel , but also as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ap@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories on Sunday against the club at Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again be back to the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians who was the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ kings in January 2016 , anyone is not crowded from the train@@ ee by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;

&quot; accordingly , investors from the domestic O@@ MV have been co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies to build the construction of the North East Coast of North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ y@@ fish is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it was too early for an evaluation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;

&quot; last Kit@@ a@@ year there were 2,@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour service , if children remain until 14 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al workers have served the fishing meal , add them to salad , raw foods and fruit , Por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group @-@ group establishments - decides about the tim@@ etable line .
&quot; the kitchen team now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ y . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for the kit@@ es easier , educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason why is : healthy food and cooking classes .
children are supposed to help eat food .
the direct connection of the kitchen forces is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important to children .
&quot; the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms , so far , is also the task of ch@@ anc@@ akes - is done in the future of special cleaning personnel . &quot;
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - beside the quality improvement of the kitchen , has also the charm that it has exhibited for the city as the most econom@@ ist , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , even though 46 partial forces will be re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but those hours fall at around 750 people in the educational area not so strong in weight , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ancy says . &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women said the UN
&quot; elections can only be representative , if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , re@@ ig@@ ning head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women in the council elections are being respected for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women can &apos;t be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
&quot; elections can only really be representative and cre@@ dible , if women are un@@ restricted and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot;
&quot; Afghan elections for the provincial council , and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat missions to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will host the power peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women is still strengthening the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women registered from a total of 3.6 million voters registered .

G@@ MB concern over investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
&quot; with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie , a union wants to make a long @-@ term commitment to production in their work at Glasgow . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company held about the future of investments in the Great cross location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is beside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the group leader of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns to express itself , that financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be driven . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win clarity over the business needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross countries , affecting our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and labour forces focus on the local community and the big Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social benefit . &quot;
&quot; therefore under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in front of the back@@ drop of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently need a floral production rate at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the team leader at Toll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to us as we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed the employees that we operate like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , our shops continuously - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operating improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of Toll@@ cross as a production site full and quite at . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago Ne@@ y@@ mar ?
the page of La League may enjoy their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain not prosec@@ uted in their persecution by Ne@@ y@@ mar , after spending an offer of £ 189 million to destroy his free@@ wheel base , but have warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , and Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the end , Ne@@ y@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest professional athletes born in the world . PS@@ G has sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way , as Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans council insi@@ sted that the club always has given its best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this view ?
&quot; as Manchester City , 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i Wo@@ unded , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best player of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G did not make it clear that they would not allow to travel to the International from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price for Ne@@ y@@ mar . &quot;

on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was arriving at the B 215 from Stol@@ ar@@ au to the B 215 .

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ estic Report &quot; &quot; report by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ don@@ atzen report to the abuse of pop@@ s from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; this writes , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann . &quot;
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to be discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; said according to the publication of the German press agency , he expected from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burg Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the respect of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express its deepest regret about their own under@@ tak@@ ings or their wrong assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; however , the Vatican Council , Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence with &quot; two different measures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the handles in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday life and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; it &apos;s going to go on the church and that &apos;s a gre@@ ed Fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; stro@@ kes have been an ordinary ped@@ agog@@ ical agent , &quot; &quot; to marry with friends as I was one , ready to finish . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared often . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg at the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990 &quot; s with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print and 67 dom@@ est@@ rows are sexually ab@@ used .
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , &quot; summar@@ ize that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
the punishment for students in the high speed was even more violent .
&quot; contrary to numerous other certificates , many victims are estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the scandal broke with the Reg@@ ens@@ burg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ens@@ ity &quot; , &quot; gives a contra@@ dict@@ ory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
for a lift many students out of &quot; humanity . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfection , which has been autograph@@ ed as a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you analyze this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you must rather ask , why the name George R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all at all . &quot;
&quot; to him , eight pages are dedicated to him and he is acquitted clearly from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of mid@@ - or fel@@ lows in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the violent processes at the pre @-@ school erup@@ ted outside of its effectiveness .
&quot; at all , you can pre @-@ throw it too late or did not have the first attempts to take seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium , which he had worked , was regarded as literally as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent witness , &quot; &quot; highly competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able &quot; , &quot; which the boys regularly supplied with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons and was always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is worth a minority about its perfection and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality which led us to sw@@ ut@@ ches even again .
&quot; that he did not only beat the ground with chairs and threw the key Con@@ federation on the ground , but also ear@@ ns ear@@ ns to the hair or ears , he himself regre@@ t@@ ted even before years , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; however , to its honor , however , it must be said that such gu@@ ardian methods in the fra@@ y time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , with parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world school , a state of school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what &apos;s in this report , the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the non@@ violence at the pre@@ school are the fre@@ est@@ ably excav@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; it is already asking if it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness , and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media were straight forward . &quot;
&quot; on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him , still eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
but the truth is : the report over@@ loaded Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in connection with the report , a lot about the topic of mis@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report was reported in the media . &quot;
&quot; will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in the final report , will also be placed in regard to sexual abuse on sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; said a fellow representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem at the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do you rate the Dom@@ don@@ tal students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student sum@@ med it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see not a case in which he would have had his tim@@ ely findings and could stop the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really ridicul@@ ous , assume that it is equivalent to him ... Bu@@ ben in@@ sist@@ ently or clear@@ er , or even more clear when compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ner , trust teachers etc . &quot;
that you speak with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in advance , more affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; concerning sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of charge of every fellow worker . &quot;
&quot; so he could not be accused of having failed , or brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; hence , there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was much of &quot; &quot; violent &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of the &quot; directions . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in coverage everything was missing and per@@ ver@@ ts became a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly that is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean separately : between the school and the school of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of seasonal teachers were correct and mal@@ ign@@ ited , all of them at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where they really have to have sc@@ andal@@ ous states . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first to face when she had already been on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; on it was like most witnesses , the theme &quot; &quot; Pre @-@ school &quot; . &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was otherwise on the Dom@@ aine closest school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann , there was discipline , but there are no seasonal violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; lots of victims inv@@ alu@@ able by R. &quot; and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
&quot; so , at the most , the accus@@ ation remains . &quot;
&quot; despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) was to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger finished his ears in front of the conditions ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he points to this point , &quot; that in the school , the tests will continue to be pract@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ations , he recommended for urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity had been banned as a test pen@@ alties in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before it took place in a legal grey zone , as everyone was still white . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to assess him difficult for him , where the people might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , where really the permissible limit was exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he would have gone .
that &apos;s just not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we &apos;re talking about the &quot; Fall@@ u@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , past the past mor@@ als . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but this is not true for sexual abuse , who was dis@@ ru@@ ined at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s clothing , that goes far beyond that . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s all quite dre@@ ad@@ ful and I &apos;m glad , that it finally works . &quot;
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means to discipl@@ ines and pun@@ ishments , so ear@@ ns and ears to attract , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden then , it has also been stri@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; what is the picture of his &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of exam@@ ining the language also ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells out of his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not w@@ asted that he carried out a stri@@ cter regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the unconditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution in Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singers and stand before every success right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience George R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well met and ever experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , very believing , deep believing and heart@@ y good people , from which one could not imagine that he could just be able to do something . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m getting regularly with how many former Dom@@ aine atzen station still , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and he &apos;s like a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him today until today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him today , that he has enriched their lives and brought them into the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he was always a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strange father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to whom they still look at today and honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything that thro@@ ws him are educational methods , that were then on the agenda . &quot;
we may be happy that we have already overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man only because he is promin@@ ently and an even more prominent brother to make the media sin . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which was just released , released him . &quot;
&quot; now the annex@@ ation was purchased , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot;
