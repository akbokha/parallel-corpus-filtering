<seg id="1">"Munich 1856: four cards, which change your view to the city"</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where youths are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mining chapel where the tunnel is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener cultivates the cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of coin promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everyone knows that, who had to be exciting, because the car-Navi took place a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than current - but is therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it is clear, as cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury area since the 19th century have changed."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a FlickenteppI that is not immediately recognisable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large map of map were used for cities and municipalities of more detailed maps, called original composition leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian surveying Administration, between 1810 and 1864, they jump the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the spring of 1800, the French armies occupied Bavaria since the Second World War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographical recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville of 9 February, 1801, there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a country-covered Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV started the project on the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau, "and thus the Bayerische Surveying Administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition of Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian Authority.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of early / today is, on the example of the state capital, on the most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the city has expanded in all directions, and has grown together."</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after creation of the map, in 1877, as the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses are concentrated in 1856 along the plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is now, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: in the zoom, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called" urine "from which the base tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots there are no farmers today, but small gardener of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area draws to the north of sub-sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 on the occasion of the October 19th century, was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">In the jungle-leaf one reads in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen not only the street names "at the guest" or from the hill "on the lugs" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfield street, people once seen people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Ireland-Irrenanstalt was created on the Auer Lüders in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the facility - that psychiatrist, who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and finished, for example, the chains of the so-called irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has instructed the staff to apply violence against the passengers," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"first place for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"sometime, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrist in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">"now on the area of the former Auer Anstalt, youths meet in the Munich Salesanum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the order acquired the building complex in 1920, and went into a youth home with training."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich east, east of homes from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 the children's house" Casa Don Bosco, "built in an architectural rejection to the origins of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in 1856, the Marienplatz was listed as a" main square, "the merchants named" Kaufinger alley. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied forces killed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof at the time of these days and will take place on 5 April 2017 on the Spatenstich's second S-Bahn train."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slipegler, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof hole."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes itinerary for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for promoting farms has issued a warning for colored people, due to the discriminating policy and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of fragile, racial-based allegations in the entire country, and here it is stated in the statement of the Group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently determined law of Missouri, which makes it harder to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who opposing the group to publish the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights, that will happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped due to their skin color, they are assembled or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that issued the organisation for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited such incidents as racist contrasts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and tried by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees informed about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring, whether it cheers, or the relatives know that they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri was posted by 100 hate crimes, according to the latest numbers from the FBI's official report, the FBI in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would become more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a travel guide for Texas and Arizona, after the United States had adopted immigration authorities to repaid people for immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU for further pensions."</seg>
<seg id="66">"accounts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent years, stakeholders have been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Female project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisheracher Weistaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">Peter White and Kordula Kovac had a picture of the CDU and Kordula Kovac.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Schwendemann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs from the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted an initial insight into his operation with 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"Schwarzwald's milk" is for him the alternative non-marketable way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the cottages only comes regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV-chairman of Fisbach, he described the female voice project as" elemental important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot be able to act on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green-land care for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the trimmer."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the terms and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and fertilized this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not perform biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"the leader Thomas Schneider was clear:" the Commune has known the importance of the fence project, and is glad about the leader of the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"you hope, that the view of the surfaces could go out a while still quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and thoughts on how they bring forth their operations," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area is 40 hectares, which can't be forwarded until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros was promoted by leader, a district belonging to the municipality of fishing."</seg>
<seg id="87">"in this way, they spent 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you are doing a really good job, without farmers and maids. "</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-of-German Parliament (lpr) Baden-Württemberg facilitates the state support of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr allocated conveyor belt.</seg>
<seg id="94">"furthermore, the unlocking area should not be farable (hangover over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the request."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 Fiscal Conference in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 km of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans value these equally as any other, therefore the sorrowly staged Saddam Hussein's attack on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideology of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he had a symbolic axe in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN's proposals to the drastic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller doesn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty Imitators would have done it when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed their importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to it, when the famous poem was added by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument."</seg>
<seg id="105">"Miller Acosta shimed:" I don't want to enter a complete thing here, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom that enlightened the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you relate later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is just right, but how he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the elaborating words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only charge any old immigrants, but the trouble of the poor:" "Your desires, your poor, and your poor masses who yearns to breathe freely, and the end of waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elating waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - were very good that they undertook a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism by producing the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is another name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the diaphragm with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it long away from the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry when Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone who bring the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not lighten the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh stumbled here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great magnificative act of Lazarus was to see them as they drew from the exhaustible, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome, which they have to hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is not the perspective, Miller and Trump ever wanted to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not shine the way, but hate hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two fleets were part of the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world champion is a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "something special in Scotland has to be something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand and we will continue to figure until we'll need to figure out," "Black said."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the circumstances of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butler, who are fought against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance while Eiliie Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her chapter speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real sense of the Eiliie, naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medal winner, which will compete with its fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that it was" unbelievable "that 16 guns are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which have been reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"last year, the middle-haul Muir carries out five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to observe the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the manna capitalist states that they are" enormously proud of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also among the medals and the Finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special feature of the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose to something very special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots, who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to get on poets."</seg>
<seg id="155">What does my speech relate to chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete there, and it's just a great atmosphere there outside."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of criticism about Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you can't use the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He immined at the critique.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, we are led as sheep for battles. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and sold their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counteraction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary stern head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillful in her, Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters and playful his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of people who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to as official and of employees who will be paid by public tax-dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or chambers, or hassily people who vibrate online."</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a parish, not a roll."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not benefited."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassert, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news releases," she wrote in the commentary section of the message "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't guess this idea too, if a number of people on the same topic takes place, then they are misused by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a great group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governor than "concentrated spam attack would be" others probably "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by removing a critic, or a negative comment is deleted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conductors and to burn protesters or protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticiously criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, last was the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they were banned from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky received Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">At present Washington's time had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous decor.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used Pseudonyms such as" Lawicola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius, "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that caused Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticise its position on the contract of Amity, the trade and shipping of shipping with Britain, overwhelmed its office, according to the historical documents produced by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, opinion of opinion and discourses belong to our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne did not packed their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"I have loved me in love, and made a offer on that day."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne reservoir and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architects and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to create a 12.5 feet high ceilings to create a home not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to be creative thinking, to solve the order."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms to arrange so that they were being stacked, without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only to build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function, or down the right height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window from Retrouvius look down over the glamorous lounge area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer mirrored units for all the best and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can exclude the kitchen, if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">"foldable kitchens, nothing new."</seg>
<seg id="1343">So special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," says Erfan of the stahlast reinforced, fearless MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so it is when you push the door high, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agents will occur, and a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high-quality materials to make the space for its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional binding in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into electrical plug sockets in the walls."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"they are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meta of something standardly into something very unusual.</seg>

<seg id="1394">"when John F.

<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information.</seg>

<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Canump was offended because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince a fair adviser to Sam Nunberg in February against the POLITICO."</seg>

<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign leaders know something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweet could not contain any more spark.</seg>

<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone was accused of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Commander of Katie Walsh," the source behind a heap of leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banned from Twitter to be banned from Twitter, or that he has sold no concrete evidence or has expressed false allegations in the past and revoked it."</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>

<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadts Oberbourgeois Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and said then by serious applicants in the house.</seg>

<seg id="1480">"in Russia's affair for U.S. President Donald Trump, a special Grand Jury, Robert Mueller is supposed to have a so-called Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the panel has recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "under calling to the cause confidential."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the CNN reported that, in connection with a meeting between Trumps, the oldest son and a Russian lawyer already reported."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for longer to have targeted at the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were disputes between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the Washington Post," wrote a few weeks ago, that the Special Representative Trump personally got into the center and find the accusation, whether the President may have disabled the judiciary. "</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys, however, is to examine and decide if charges shall be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called count of count.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"mostly, they are turned on if there are larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite persons to the hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the transmitter, CNN had already been issued in order to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps Consultant and Head-ohn Jared Kushner and his damaging director Paul Manafort were talking about their discussion."</seg>

<seg id="1499">"however, it must not be promised that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic gives the Democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about that they can speak."</seg>

<seg id="1505">"however, these work usually work in the hearing, also emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocate any measures that accelerated the work of the special interest on "faire" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI boss James Comey said three times, that it was not determined against the president."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has been changed, called it in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this root, accusations were made against Trump, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him about an investigation of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is standing under large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to a presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special interest and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">That dissolved speculations about whether Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of Congress such as the Watergate affair, a position in which he returned to President Richard Nixon, Mueller holds a position in which he could be fired on the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory."</seg>

<seg id="1816">"there are drug adggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand at the behest list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and throughout the country the corpses are frequent, and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto gave up his office in December 2012. 589 there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editors and inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is deeply connected, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that shows his middle finger with the word" Justice "," T-Shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a member of the Prosecution were established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only had two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, who are connected every year with drug trafficking and organized crime, the journalists were only seldom tried in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is still a traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting concerning the discussion of safety is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid, time to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the things, we miserable."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was shot down from his car and was shot at him, probably because of the name of the paper - who was translated with" twelfth River "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to wander freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on Valdez's theme there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in January last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sinaloa to become one of the bloody slaughter fields in the country, because rivaling fractions have been fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people on the street are shot, or that the cemetery is full of distressed, two-storey Mausoleum for drugs that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"for a minute, forget that there is a state of" rest "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioodoce, with the blame for his friend to protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of a rival time in war with Guzmans's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have offended the sons, the gangsters bought each copy of the output when she was extradited to newspaper cab."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez not to force, after the decision of another newspaper, which had published the same story, the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican force against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined Rioodoce with five colleagues and sold 50 USD in holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism, "" said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time, the newspaper served a call for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, hard to publish investigation without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to assume the task which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the case of many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaak-bird, who was able to curse like a doer worker, the friend, who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always sit in El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask, was his love to routine his calamity?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death, too, has forced her to ask her own assumptions about how they can do the best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways and landing ways."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-centime and self-maintaining."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instances.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, not just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Rioodoce met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were permitted. days previously announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used exclusively for governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">"they were commissioned by the regional government, to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-sized building in Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of police officers, who called the governor himself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug had come under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Rioce has blocked three main layers."</seg>
<seg id="1876">"it was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa."</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the State expenditures, which concentrated on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group called in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor's Office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about how it was abducted or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling institutiontional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several PRI governors were accused of corruption of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous events in this local restaurant, including one, in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman had escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez had considered the best informed resource for the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously, we had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body structure. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communicating with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office has become a storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something that they have never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez made a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration by another journalist on the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Micoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become more powerful as they have written in organised protests" SOS Press "for walking and construction."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to exploit journalists and they will cause them to have told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has therefore asked that she was once again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organized crime, involved in the government officials and a valid corporation."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-journalism "he wrote that reporters not only killed by drug abuse, but also on orders of politicians and security forces working with organized crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks against journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die, because they want you to hold the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note, which was supposedly signed by Zetas-Kartell:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones besides their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua, after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do such as El manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug card with an editorial on the front page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home country or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, gives the drug trafficking to him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I was reporters," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Rioodoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sums."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shooting paintings with bandrivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate how it was promised by a number of antitell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the curristone wall, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the enormous portrait of the folded founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the staff of Rioodoce followed his traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," "Bojorquez," if he was murdered on the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send them on the road. "</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used tarry to soften his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, though a terrifying."</seg>

<seg id="1925">"it was so good that it could even determine that his created skin was of reddish Braun - and they said they had something of a" unquiet past. ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "called him as" the spatterned dinosaurs, who ever was found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period from 110 million to 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that it was" truly remarkable "" to flourish. "</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the pannized plant-eaters is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was located on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, green."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of Earth's heavy Earth."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all of these hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only flashing a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell museum, where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs models - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that this plant-fresser, although it is covered with a armor, probably resembles a convertible tank, probably threatened by meat-vores dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong mored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide before carers, and used a parachuting technique that is used as counter-atting, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been permitted to mix better into its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts, what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"the 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May, and has now been seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild animal and studied at Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechnic Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of scales and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the confrontation, a common defence method in the animal, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the conterization is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeding the animals of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution has benefited the wear of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras, or girdle - are much smaller and injurious than prey, which is signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strong breaded dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rodents of the Cretaceous must have been", "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales, also shows that the skin of the dinosaur-brown was red."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on its life, including the fourth Darminhaltes to find out what it eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, came into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as South-orida today, and rivers and oceans probably have a lot more popular than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with concreted skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only feel a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the mored dinosaur was hunted from some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this is the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavier."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings in Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was sank after the death of the sea and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the living-held dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from snout to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures had an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that pushed back from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the pannized plant-eaters was wasted by the western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater flow of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin condition still cover hollow-prige tank panels along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, it is such a level of conservation so rare as a profit in lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"remains the remains of the skin, still cover the holyfish plates that carry the skull of the beast."</seg>

<seg id="1977">"it uses mild to moderate injuries, said a pollucent precher."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large outlay of lifeguards was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"comes the Schaffner, wakes up an unsurion or breaks off from the workflow from the workflow."</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of breaks are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the timeless ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">Simply confirm by phone that you have taken his place and evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently a test run is running on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer comes, we expand it out."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available at the beginning of the year to many more remote traffic routes in Germany," "said a railway speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in," calls the railway to the ticket devaluation without Schaffner. "</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to use the use, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what do most passengers do already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator's app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat space.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"the" "comfort check-in" "works so: one gets up to the train, calling the ticket under" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button on the electronic release appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train conductor get a message on their mobile devices that driving gast X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"the train conductor is available at number Y's ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger car with already more profitable online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in" has two advantages: one for customers, one for the rail, which is to use the passengers again. "</seg>
<seg id="2009">"anyone who wants to travel without ticket control by our train attendant, check in the DB Navigator itself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows the passengers to design their travel time on the train of personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Manager of DB Remote traffic. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who is often railways, knows that in addition to delay and accidental trains, the ticket controls are one of the biggest troubles."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in any case, one of the travellers do not need any documents in any case you need to devaluation online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card or else a document must be found.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result are endless discussions between train conductor and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the part or large space and delays at the control of their own tickets and the Schaffner at the end time takes care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of testers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's just on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2030">"she switched her mobile phone to Tweet on the Canfield Drive, later on the evening."</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police killed just my unarmed son! "</seg>

<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, disbursed another policeman and cried, saying," I will all kill you... "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell reminded their testimony. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, which we have accustomed to us and which we can typically call."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt shivers."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock they took her 6-year old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love, and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of people living in community living and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, they possessed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered that which she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not correct."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it has to know, and to see it in it."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it needs to be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have lucky enough to give her a experience in which they personally experienced no eklatant racism, it is no different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove you a bad service to keep it far away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police administration, which became the activists on the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business partner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism for Ferrell shape began to accept.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after the 9th of August, she said, notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on Essence-justice and health qualities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question occurred Ferrell in the sense:" do you want to document, or try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often from the white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their votes and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"following the then co-director Damon Davis, Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, which is known for his activism around Todestract-Insulation."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought to the project closer, along with six other locals, the team of" Whose Streets "followed?" in the years after the Browns sequence. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we speak "said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as these people are presented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but around a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, as she loves herself and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be a certain extent in this work, and in the realisation of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founder of the movement, which had influenced the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as a gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting at different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"folayan agreed to notice, that" the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insisted that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was selected as a heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, even though it was at the front of the front, because at a life in these cruises than a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"the news cameras in Ferguson has long gone, but the rerical connections between the community and the police remain."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years, due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she klert themselves at a song and she feels obliged to this memory, since she went to Ferguson for three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains.</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-readers discuss the bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the Bit Gallery moves the people, even though it is not built yet long."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone is outdated since the first presentation in 2009, the population in advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the theme is hardly any one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the Bit Gallery:" it would be a dream "(Anja Becker), or" This is really great "(Nicole rocking), comes from the other side:" "does not need a person" "(Siggi Bing) or completely simple:" "size!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates are designed to build more customers in the city, of which the other business also benefit, fear the opponent, that then the pedestrian street is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"furthermore: the gallery is planned on the plot, on which the peasant market stands, in which 13 direct their products will offer."</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will conclude with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda Square, with the opportunity to sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Rooms:" "we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm were always happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butcher for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of rent. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project should probably not be low in the new project.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's your shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, Drogerie- or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"of that, there is already enough in our city."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"however, you see how many charges there are empty - some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is the more important that at least the Markthalle will remain at least."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered here is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is obendable."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only from larger companies because they are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores, there is almost no more and what is left still, will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmers market stand during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"old EDEKA would be the solution - even at duration, when the bit gallery actually comes in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or will it be able to drive back all the shops from Bitburg in advance?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"one shopping center, which stands empty, does not need any one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant hall it is thanks to the mad guy - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no room anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market is captured, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown that are almost invisible, that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tubes and hair sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst condemned a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly acknowledged diplomatic news on the site of WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline agreed in technology, computer science, and art, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his position."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg, by algorithmic analysis of DNA, created by Manning, could not only look like someone with these genomic data, such as someone can be interpreted with these genomic data, such as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly spoken about the identification as a woman in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is deliberately stuck on a driver's seat and carries a platine Perch - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just returned from the great success of their 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"the artist portrait of strangers from forensic Artefacts produced like cigars and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if they wanted to do a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were unequal to unequal letters that took over several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they created even one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic" Supported Images, "which would be predicted to see a future in which the President Cheliva verdict would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"Obama actually was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings was given the release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happily meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, as Donald Trump takes a war against informant from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to resolve the rigid column which he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked by a strange timing of all these things, she said that" things were going to happen in a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one of the gallery of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with her superior signature (the" i "in their family name is an end of the" automatic shredder, their foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thoughtful of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nukleotenoids following the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take care of it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-free-efon in the hands of the United States, such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they chill your speech, then they won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never just the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greet them from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goose, if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition even in person - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks which are summarized like hordes of Protestants."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"that was also aimed at all, like everything in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic hapers were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like the Chelsea, like the movement that was even behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he thought unexpectedly."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only wrote on the thumb pressure on the page of a letter so reacted, who worked from a double assistant in the 1700's, he says for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2343">"under the chairmanship of the government, the five Vice Premiers, and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs."</seg>

<seg id="2354">The big mantle at the army and the security forces is going on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan made a further 7395 government operators, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"in doing so, Erdogan was tamed up the military."</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals are earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they lowered three times under calling for their role as a guardian of the world leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military step by step, not least at calling for the reform of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that in 2017 it cannot be more crazy, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot to select its form of nipples and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the company deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sexpuppen have developed themselves from their inflatable partners to robots, which feels warm, that feels warm - with aware of human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot accordingly to its beliefs" "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot through the form of nipples to type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be even more worried because many robots would have the "personalities" that would look like a stepford-woman of progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example to adjust its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they will find appetibility."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities as" "Frigid Farrah" "which conveys the impression of timidity and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her mood, quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrisome aspects of this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subsistent female properties, the anomalings on rape, when one step on Frigid (means: resisting) Farrah, quiet a most important one."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, true true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for males."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men have no root xy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just a different sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and its increasing refinement point to a little darker and low tide in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality within a desire to sex with subjugation as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notice their rising popularity, they still remain temporary at the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but something from the boundary zones can be leakened in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, be very educational."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market applies to this."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are immersed in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which the White House present an president to have attacked women with sexual attack."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most awesome aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphical images that works devours bodies and the outstretched eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind this sex robot is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders, they want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "robots are not real women."</seg>

<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing, which could affect independence, or anything, which could disturb the imagination."</seg>

<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"if we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the gruselty way that we will no longer be able to repay his Mittens of one day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is a still dissolderous long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing" normalizes, "which appeared in comparison to its standards suddenly as a epitome of contamination."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find me today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the reimed - the dog on the car roof, which saw 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as a very mild criminal offence."</seg>

<seg id="2494">"BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">You should improve the emission behaviour of the Euro 5 emission standard for Euro 5 and partial Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe assessments:</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, in the United States, affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and bleedings, recurring or bloody attacks, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during the victims usually come to relieve meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found drugs to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunity in the gut is patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hide themselves in food not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to dissolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when equilibrium is inclined towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, a kind of tolerance conveying immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium into their innards."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had it from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition tolerate, less inflammatory bowel diseases, if the same system is working with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral prizes in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan sought out a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as they found that a group of study powers had such cells, but a different group of the same family that was separated from them."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it thought that the difference was to do with the gut microbiomen of mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterium species found in mice, but were missing with the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were tucked in a sterile environment so that they had lacked a gut microbiom and they did not developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria accounted for the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri in a liquid and then resulted in small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant conveyor cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a side-product of tryptophan-metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophandicapped were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant conveyor cells, such as mice, and that most of us would protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri found the cells in humans like in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophandicapped values in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the scandal broke with the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violensity "," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift many students out of "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfection, which has been autographed as a Domspatz musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you must rather ask, why the name George Ratzinger appears at all at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"to him, eight pages are dedicated to him and he is acquitted clearly from any suspicion of mid- or fellows in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violent processes at the pre-school erupted outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at all, you can pre-throw it too late or did not have the first attempts to take seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, which he had worked, was regarded as literally as" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent witness," "highly competent," "competent," "competent," and "understandable", "which the boys regularly supplied with cakes, cookies and bonbons and was always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is worth a minority about its perfection and its high Emotionality which led us to swutches even again.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only beat the ground with chairs and threw the key Confederation on the ground, but also earns earns to the hair or ears, he himself regretted even before years, deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its honor, however, it must be said that such guardian methods in the fray time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, with parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a world school, a state of school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what's in this report, the horrible sexual abuse and the nonviolence at the preschool are the freestably excavate."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is already asking if it is not more likely to do with his acquaintness, and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media were straight forward."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still eagerly awaited."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report overloaded Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, a lot about the topic of misuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen report was reported in the media."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"will Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, will also be placed in regard to sexual abuse on sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to speak with my father or my mother," said a fellow representative for the others, "" It was all very embarrassing to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem at the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they trusted not even parents and siblings, then not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domdontal students Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student summed it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see not a case in which he would have had his timely findings and could stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really ridiculous, assume that it is equivalent to him... Buben insistently or clearer, or even more clear when compared to their parents, internatsleitner, trust teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"so the report comes to the very clear result:" that in advance, more affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"concerning sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free of charge of every fellow worker."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so he could not be accused of having failed, or brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"hence, there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflicting crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was much of" "violent" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of the "directions."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in coverage everything was missing and perverts became a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of George Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean separately: between the school and the school of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, let's say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of seasonal teachers were correct and malignited, all of them at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where they really have to have scandalous states."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys first to face when she had already been on the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on it was like most witnesses, the theme" "Pre-school". ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was otherwise on the Domaine closest school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann, there was discipline, but there are no seasonal violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" lots of victims invaluable by R. "and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories are linked to him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at the most, the accusation remains."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) was to hear nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger finished his ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this way, he points to this point," that in the school, the tests will continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative parliamentations, he recommended for urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity had been banned as a test penalties in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before it took place in a legal grey zone, as everyone was still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to assess him difficult for him, where the people might be exaggerated or dramatized, where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he would have gone.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we're talking about the" Falluck of Anachronism, "thus the danger, past the past morals."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is not true for sexual abuse, who was disruined at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's clothing, that goes far beyond that."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"that's all quite dreadful and I'm glad, that it finally works."</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means to disciplines and punishments, so earns and ears to attract, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden then, it has also been stripped."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what is the picture of his" My brother of Pope "in the talks with you for the book" My Brother of the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of examining the language also?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells out of his perspective, as the Domsparrows played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not wasted that he carried out a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution in Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and Bonbons alone, one makes no big singers and stand before every success right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience George Ratzinger in the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger really well met and ever experienced a wonderful, humorous, very believing, deep believing and hearty good people, from which one could not imagine that he could just be able to do something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I'm getting regularly with how many former Domaine atzen station still, 23 years after his Emergency, visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and he's like a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him today until today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most Domsparrows are thankful to him today, that he has enriched their lives and brought them into the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strange father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to whom they still look at today and honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything that throws him are educational methods, that were then on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We may be happy that we have already overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man only because he is prominently and an even more prominent brother to make the media sin."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just released, released him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the annexation was purchased, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally in peace."</seg>
