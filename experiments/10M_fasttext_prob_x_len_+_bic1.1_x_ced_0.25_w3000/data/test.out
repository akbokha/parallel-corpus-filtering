Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this Hollywood star has failed to clear the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I will always be put into drawers , or receive from the outside label , which with me and reality usually have little to do . &quot;
&quot; I myself have not wish to be perfect , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather s@@ cour@@ sing . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at that she is as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it says in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; as a gift , the actress gets her time at home , pre @-@ equipped TVs with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and mexican food , says it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the bald , they bring the question after the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we must not be married to be married or children to be perfect &quot; , &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid @-@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger searched a little variation with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a couple of minutes , the horses remembered her holiday evening , they hunt for the feed in the fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; a kilometre at this temp@@ o , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses . &quot;
he left his family with his family on the layout of the AL@@ RV on a horse . he did not try to play a photo .
the first time in Aachen and the CH@@ IO was the first time in Aachen .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports car survived the man from An@@ hausen in a small Gala with the Golden sports pyramid .
at awards there is not a lack of sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
&quot; Federal Chancell@@ ery , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has w@@ asted him .
long is the 18th Prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this distinction means very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not just for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he went to the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 major sports athletes , the two @-@ fold U.S. ma@@ stics won the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Spr@@ inge Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously wonder the hand of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sporting events had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; investing in infrastructure and the trading agreement , T@@ TP will prevent both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are , however , in tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
&quot; he , about the role of the state . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against it , such as the state of economy may harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate the economy , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will drive back regul@@ ators , and he is strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and businesses . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton says : the State has certain duties to open , he has more advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes were increased to the rich , it says . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidate , announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are refused by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump so there could still be part@@ isan discussions .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and the coal transport in the USA .
&quot; in so far protected areas , oil promotion should also be possible to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to its investment program , Clinton wants to increase renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will create super@@ power the clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - also at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ ose trade agreement , they don &apos;t want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both companies do not want to is@@ olate the United States by international trade , but just better to protect American jobs . &quot;
they should also be paid even better . Clinton calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger @-@ tap .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once again he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ alled , then he says he could not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the control policy of both bearings .
&quot; on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to pay the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critic will hold him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every living woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost daily life . &quot;
&quot; when arriving in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women sitting .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is more than a year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ arding with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she smile short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social services in Bavaria , and is concerned with the topic of women on the escape . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all@@ u@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ancer . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted , because they are committed to torture or death , or because their families will send them as a hopes for Europe . &quot;
&quot; for women , other reasons for escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honour , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this continues . &quot;
&quot; that tu@@ g may require a bottle of water for a bottle of water , no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that once they come in Germany , ir@@ re , tell B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , women in refugee camps would often be regarded as min@@ der@@ less and worse in worst case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that approximately 90 per cent of women who live in the north of Munich , are in trau@@ mat@@ ised , appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily developed . &quot;
there are so many women to say that they do nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help themselves , there are more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in Munich on the question of a similar project , such as in Munich , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in accomod@@ ations of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press release of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Central French are in some common floors or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or men are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - for@@ ce@@ ful - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all the shower room should be separated and accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how very the women feel this protective needs , one can read on the And@@ res , which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been talking about it , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
Regist@@ rar : claims for new working events
&quot; assistant of the assistance of assistance , assist@@ ants have called to adopt new business events with their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council starting at the beginning of September more work events .
the J@@ DC said that his ministers would have missed the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed on the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract that has been agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said the government of &quot; &quot; har@@ r@@ ably quiet &quot; &quot; would have remained the fact that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; In view the J@@ DC party voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and demands official new negotiations to all of those who are concerned . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC executive committee today asked a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of escal@@ ating events that starts at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ utes led to that assistance of assistance in this year , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; according to the conclusion of the agreed contra@@ ctual conditions , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the conclusion of the agreed contra@@ ctual conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt , said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of foreign side@@ ways &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish head@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot defend the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a towel , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile worked nar@@ ro@@ ly , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for its rest@@ rained conditions . &quot;
&quot; Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , however , spoke repeatedly by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved so far as it would never happen . &quot;
&quot; I seemed to indicate the opposite to me , enthusiasm . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s be@@ aming , sustainable bol@@ dness showed that Russia &apos;s chief of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution : the shooting of a Russian fighter vehicle at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was horri@@ fied .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back .
&quot; the fact was even bigger , since it was committed by an even boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the cut @-@ up again becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media held a fierce , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once it appeared , the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the alleg@@ ations of conducting officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ologies that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire is clear . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is primarily associated with all friends who he can get after the last month after a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
terrorist attacks on Turkey repeated him also sha@@ ken .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
&quot; in particular , Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resumed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists stay there long , tomatoes for long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , since its reaction to the attempted power of power was regarded as weak response . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the persistent groove on the snow @-@ emp@@ t of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ds to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the west . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of government won a bonus for providing a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in Ankara following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
this is true for Moscow . self @-@ understand@@ able is that itself a deep @-@ sitting fear of regime change .
&quot; the summit meeting in this glorious palace allowed it in Russia and Turkey , one of how it described me an analy@@ st , &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries who viol@@ ate themselves from the West and are badly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between these two differences . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sites . &quot;
&quot; it could be recording that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference , both President said that they would not once stri@@ ped out . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey for@@ mi@@ ed it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus about it where a common denomin@@ ator may be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than NATO member Turkey , it is certainly better that the two heads of heads will speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland ( no longer available )
the R@@ BS brand will be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Chief of Staff .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since dist@@ orted since it was almost f@@ oll@@ ed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; in this time , brand names &quot; R@@ BS &quot; are used to protect other end @-@ consumption brands . &quot;
&quot; they supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , by Six Nations Rug@@ by up to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now it has decided to move more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B are references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange for Nat@@ West . &quot;
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become one of our investment brand , as well as the brand that our employees will be busy as we now have more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we are not a global goals , but are pursuing local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these stamps will be completely different in their own congregations for something completely , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and will increase the perception of different brands in his Sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of brands , as we focus ourselves inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restart these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray Champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured over 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market on Friday .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won against G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional , because my family is also here &quot;
I &apos;m very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday night with 20.000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the jubil@@ ation when he re@@ covering the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career of career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone in just a few years ago .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , distingu@@ ishes him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been thr@@ illed for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already scored 6,000 win@@ nings if he was not only a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already attracted nearly 30 years of winning players what was great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone of a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British fla@@ x for two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially returned difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month sperm , but he showed an impressive strong force to de@@ vote his branch and to his best form . &quot;
and he &apos;s still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin reli@@ eved Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the close confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin is ordered by the ab@@ dic@@ ation of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been an deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he made his graduation at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) , and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the head of the head of the head office and the head of the head office . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government , to support their activities as a state leader regarding legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet intelligence service .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody currently knows that .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man who once was once appointed a potential president , wants to lead once the Russian environmental policy - pushed on large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said , &quot; &quot; said IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true that I was asked to put this very complicated position at the beginning of 2012 - one could say almost there for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it emerg@@ es , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ bility Service ( FS@@ B ) he was appointed the K@@ GB , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people , whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could lead to Putin &apos;s second term President of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this item was taken by another , close allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
&quot; Putin became prime minister , before he became president of three and a half years later . &quot;
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he struck producer

&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and I put the last twelve years my whole heart bl@@ ut , &quot; &quot; said Gibson in one on Friday . &quot;

fish Ri@@ dd@@ les in Ban@@ ff Garden
&quot; a inhabitants of Ban@@ ff demanded the identification of the fish help , which di@@ pped in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot;
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could take part in the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale who were r@@ ins@@ ed by a fountain of fountain .
&quot; Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of spectac@@ le in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Queens@@ bor@@ Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ uses cros@@ sings with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four fin@@ ances of the &quot; Deck@@ blo@@ wers , &quot; which is completed by completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 shr@@ ubs . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today the construction of Economy Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site , and was one of the first to come across the country . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ uses cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineers with a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of closing is between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck a heated activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bre@@ cks in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks receives a bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck today , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the cl@@ asp represents future @-@ oriented high@@ - and deep construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street circuit and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap in the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern slopes of 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very sacred activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , about 6,000 tons weighs and at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % to the top had to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; hei@@ rs , because the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , they were tiny - at each side they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
three men were lucky to be &quot; lucky &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat was moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blo@@ wn the boat apart from their range , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted from 60 and on a boy@@ ars without life@@ jacket was found .
they arrived all aboard the coastal area and were brought back to rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have happiness , injured and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had a not@@ ing wheel , but it dis@@ b@@ anded at the boot of the Bo@@ ots from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has wav@@ ed over those men today .
severely injured - man stands on his ex @-@ girlfriend !
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police informed yesterday , the 50 year old had the keys to get the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead the dr@@ ink@@ ers cut the clothes of his ex @-@ friend instead .
&quot; when they came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed twice to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ ar@@ im@@ pover@@ ished his sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted a calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her life . &quot;
&quot; on the road , they met the ex @-@ habit@@ ants of the man . &quot;
&quot; when the two women bet@@ ting the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had his sister to side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs low apartments ?
the SPD and Green Party : investors should become much stronger in the duty .
how do you react to the bad news that Bruns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 favorable dwellings in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes an &quot; act of action &quot; to the next rating plan .
but dispute is programmed .
in the first line it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; the SPD leader , Christoph Fr@@ mann , said : &quot; we are looking forward to the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all dwellings as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favourable apartments can also be seen in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the great forces in the city hall , however , says : &quot; how are you looking for investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such land at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new residential construction program , which will cost millions , will be paid for inc@@ enti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as a few rules .
the left will still want hardness down for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , Brat@@ mann , whi@@ pped himself up with the situation of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get skilled workers .
&quot; yet the program does not stand alone : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should only be built . &quot;
&quot; but how do we compare the loss of some 1,300 inexpensive apartments , which will come out in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments alone . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ er spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased now out of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about to get apartments back into the price . &quot;
this is possible in the West city .
&quot; on a blow , the problem can be solved . &quot;
&quot; because in the western city , at the end of the year , there are dead@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could go back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : that &apos;s what the owners do not want to build on housing companies .
&quot; the number of social housing in the West city is dra@@ stically increased , removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts would not give it anymore .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there is still motion in discussion .
&quot; president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU must be with the boat . &quot;
which concentrated on more construction sites for single family homes .
&quot; but what does not mean , however , that no compromise can be found . &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go a hunting for health and happiness that pays off
&quot; it is fascinating , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; so that teenagers and kid are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to rigid on screens , was in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , people go to get and get more active from the sofa . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the screen was limited to TV , then on video games and last@@ ly on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; so , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it emerged from a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries has been moved through massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot;
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go out to their smartphone and are searching for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ ced with a GPS and once they once were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; taken &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that determines the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ac , a app for Apple Watch , which followed 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , 45 percent to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns on health , people want to bring to &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; to be active from the sofa , because many public messages are boring to health , and they come from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; he who drives regular sport , reduces his chances to develop cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring people to do something outdoors for having fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friends .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ cher games that need to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should I do ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphones were able to pursue our activity as Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in real world and helping many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jump horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now also the Olympic @-@ singer .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ struggle and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes below the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
the overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; - Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt in the Swe@@ des during the single multi @-@ campaign women during the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign chapter , and overall the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation to be the best of their generation , or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when their final score was shown and her long journey was found at the end . &quot;
this success poses in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; the last three years dominated their sport art , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she was &quot; the best gy@@ mn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final inspection in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between you and a last over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ces themselves after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight for women in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ o took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served on the farewell party of Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i who served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although it insi@@ sted on the top , during their long journey to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is tailored to all Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympics in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , which was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gy@@ mn@@ asium , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became strength . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will stop as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; although Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two fil@@ ings , the image dec@@ ayed . &quot;
pig sha@@ ken and bo@@ oth@@ ur@@ ns - in which the world champion is holding the world title .
&quot; she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ des again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still another . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when they expected her du@@ ck - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears fell on Bil@@ ke shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision , which they once described in their collection . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ aille went in a low place of Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old men were dedicated to the Americans , who is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; from the Americans . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercising , they threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that was sometimes doub@@ tful . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week , the 19 @-@ year old twe@@ et has a completely new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in action with music listening in the car
&quot; according to police report published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first series of production of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entering , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots of a towel weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police claimed that the triple murder could not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , as the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ator to become a further look at it , whether they are associated with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic homes were killed seven people within four months and two more injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects multiple vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expos@@ e the evidence that they were led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of its injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah died in the spot . &quot;
&quot; a witness divided the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music . &quot;
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about shooting , which assumed an empty Pick@@ up truck to a half hour before the three @-@ fold murder and out of the fact that it was the work of the series production . &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the fe@@ west of its anti@@ quities , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I create it not . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
&quot; what is not true - of course , one has left to it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her husband , she has told that Edmund it can never be seen under circumstances , and that he may not survive once . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they beat him to institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a remedy .
Edmund was neither sitting nor cra@@ wling up to his third year of life . he still cannot speak .
but he makes progress slow .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Edmund for &quot; Please add something to me &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring his drawing language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- it says . Edmund has invented several signs .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic like at Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how to affect the life of the z@@ ic@@ avirus in@@ fest@@ ed .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I have been asked for a long time already after the forecast because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth@@ damage caused by Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it will get better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainfall , flood events on b@@ ail@@ ments in Louisiana , Mississippi &quot;
heavy rain@@ falls and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday . it will reck@@ on all the Saturday above with more rain@@ falls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of K@@ pp@@ is flooded their shore , threatened with severe floo@@ ding in extreme rain@@ falls , reported the national weather service . &quot;
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials in constant contact with local authorities have already been on the way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , an spokesperson for the office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , shared that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags alone .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the South Lou@@ isi@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service dismissed that additional 3 @-@ 5 inches could fall to rain in this area .
&quot; on Friday , a Fl@@ ut@@ early war@@ n system was deployed on Friday , while it remained in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , which are located both in Louisiana , will reach a record level after the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be flooded with many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream was a danger of floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish , as these are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river ticket Bu@@ fa@@ v , south of the Mississippi federal border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest point at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
the rescue teams are still getting people out of the flood water in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water is from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from its house to rise overnight . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son @-@ son , who lives near her , had warned . &quot;
&quot; we woke up and war@@ med the water and war@@ med in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she lived there , never had such a blast of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford told that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was quickly spread out , because there were still heavy rainfall , and that the authorities evacu@@ ation evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers close to Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday tomorrow from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been su@@ cked considerably by the rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
authorities admitted that heavy rain@@ falls and street over@@ floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ dependent sender WW@@ L reported that a su@@ peri@@ or@@ acle in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 was over @-@ flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , which were both flooded now . &quot;
&quot; the presi@@ dium of the congregation of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have had 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to host the evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , nearly two dozens of roads were closed and sand @-@ bags for the residents and they hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum by the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Pap@@ pp the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said it remains ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
&quot; according to his data , a hand@@ ful houses will be reported on Thursday as over@@ sw@@ amped on Thursday , but on Friday there were no reported to date . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; by spher@@ es &quot; , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week has already been the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys uni@@ denti@@ fied him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several scar@@ ves , including in the le@@ aning , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at the hospital with his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has under@@ gone a lot , his small body was extingu@@ ished by balls , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ ende@@ z to the broad@@ caster . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy became a critical hospital in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
&quot; the boy &apos;s family divided the transmitter , that it is expected to re@@ prove again . &quot;
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old man .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 year old , which is found in a critical condition , covers the broad@@ caster . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined , though , under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently come to a cross @-@ fire between several archers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ ics for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to various assault ri@@ ots , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
&quot; it seems that , in fact , it is clear to have a constant fight . &quot;
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , they were leg@@ umes . &quot;

why we need Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine among women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ nen and that is more than a reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : these team has three tur@@ rets , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in is round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
over the last four years the number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American female tower .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising official Olympics in America and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ stic rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ course event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but they don &apos;t see gy@@ ms in the whole country . &quot;
Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic champion is only four tur@@ ner@@ ves in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns become a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private turn@@ tables that are maintained by parents that can apply for training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since it started with the turbul@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the municipalities of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , make a more powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ access turn@@ around . &quot;
I founded my gy@@ ms of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have served free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns that earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports art . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns developed strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
&quot; the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in interested and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise further strikes after having refused Jeremy Hun@@ &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ ary of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,000 assist@@ ants who voted in a choice . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt had revealed plans to attack the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance of assistance should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend operations to improve maintenance times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mem@@ ees for assistance in Assi@@ enz@@ ologists shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant doctors said before serious concerns , especially that it will meet the current occupancy rate and to treat all doctors alike . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks that remain still remaining , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the disp@@ utes caused by talks during the Government to participate in the government on withdrawal and sometimes start af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made it last month , that his door would always reveal . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , lift up the insur@@ gency and concern the concerns of doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he doesn &apos;t have to do this , so the assistance doctors have made clear that they are ready to perform further work events . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13,000 r@@ ine@@ operations and 100,000 sched@@ ules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant medical doctors on the strike of strike . &quot;
the Minister had been hoping to end the dispute over the changes due to the re@@ formed Treaty of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A wants to be a better weekly re@@ warding for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants who will be subject to the contract .
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS staff , demanded the assistance of assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ avi@@ est said : &quot; &quot; working events can &apos;t reach anything but little , but they have already loaded up well @-@ loaded teams and service providers and their families just wor@@ ries , emergency and interru@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we were talking to the comm@@ it@@ ee of assist@@ ants and respon@@ ding to the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries , respon@@ ding to the concerns and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employer hop@@ ed that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as discover@@ ies , flexibility for training , training courses , mutual recognition of the teaching , training courses and gender equality in medicine - such as seriously the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after the authorities recommended that more people have been fixed for a longer period of time .
the increased drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke , or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulator is recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulator is recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fet@@ al material in the arter@@ ial walls .
&quot; when the siege breaks , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots that tre@@ sp@@ ends blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots solves , it can flow through blood flow and the blood flow to the brain , causing stroke . &quot;
people who had already had a heart attack on a higher risk have to have another risk .

&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in the reduction of other heart attacks and stro@@ kes , which already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand treatments options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness can flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption of a government report because of corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness led to the fact that the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities was ignored today as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet board Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber in order to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on eth@@ nic@@ ities concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption mo@@ ist , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ ves should be so bad that the police should be permitted out of choice out of elec@@ tive voters to protect def@@ ending voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a reference to their identity , in order to prove their identity . &quot;
&quot; at present , voters only need to call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , do not remove the ink on the finger of a person if they leave their voice , to avoid that somebody cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of not official comm@@ ences or employment groups .
&quot; this is not only against electoral violence , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial concrete culture that can get involved , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by the Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Court decided that the may@@ est mayor of Lut@@ for Rah@@ man should be corrupt after a lit@@ urg@@ y on corrupt and illegal practices of his amber . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rachel had made the religious feelings of its Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia for silence . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign based on the basis , that it is the reli@@ ous obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doub@@ tful or a consequence of im@@ itation , where one person cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was no evidence of fraud in the whole country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent brie@@ fing - at the older members of the Muslim community have made pressure to people to choose one candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean@@ se the electoral system , including the mouse to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the Will@@ ens of the El@@ derly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ dic or ban@@ quet . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a matter of &quot; politically correct &quot; belie@@ fs concerning eth@@ nic@@ ism and religion would have been ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists work documents to stop &quot; reap &quot; election . &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May into consideration , also demands tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social @-@ bet@@ rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in order to consider , voters want to ask for your passport . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t remove remote ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has delivered their voice to avoid that somebody cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person do to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to mot@@ ions on an automatic envelope .
&quot; prohibition , that political activists work complete letters and envel@@ opes . &quot;
the police force the power of setting out def@@ ences for voting stations .
&quot; a change of legislation , which facil@@ it@@ ates an indictment due to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( the referendum Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer ban in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in voting stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees take the rule that voters go alone to the voting cabin . &quot;
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the election court ruled Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a Lit@@ an@@ ei of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons for reasons - according to the high demands of criminal proceedings - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ Control &quot; of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Supreme Court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and the band that has proved an impressive double @-@ course in the heart of Cambridge .
but the 24 year old Olympics is not the only one to fight gold fighting Ath@@ let who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you give the social media faith .
&quot; in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces , which are fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has made an lists of Olympic characteristics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ famous pages . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from a double @-@ course on the wheel train , many people on the Internet decided to be like a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ dy@@ mus from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a attack on Twitter after pictures of which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ mistak@@ ably .
&quot; in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness in the social media and to hear that he had already heard his childhood as Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity , except the facial hair@@ y , shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a charming guy , so let me feel it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular Ver@@ sions since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur more in the centre : the open simil@@ arity between British broad@@ casts Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
&quot; the Russian gy@@ mn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through as a double @-@ course for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;

&quot; another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and A@@ ctor Jos@@ h Hart@@ ley , which has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal for Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ b@@ illed skin and bl@@ on@@ ded hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan said Adrian von fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;

not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others like the simil@@ ar@@ ities too .
&quot; theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
&quot; Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was turned off when he will give his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200 Fre@@ stil@@ ties .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ator of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the attack , baby . &quot;
&quot; as Mor@@ called , he died as a pig . &quot;

&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to un@@ lock the gap in China . &quot;

&quot; criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with him many to speech . &quot;
Twitter User didn &apos;t take back when they heard how un@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you only represent C@@ BC and Canada and lets all look like ra@@ assi@@ sts . # adjusted .
&quot; a short time later Scott Rus@@ sel , who was moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for us that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC taught at the end of more than 90 times the people who have responded to B@@ emer@@ al on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ators Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his sorry for more than 90 other Twitter Us@@ ers who had compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments .
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message out .
&quot; we regret it correctly , that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast it . &quot;
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed fast to our audience on TV show and our fol@@ lo@@ om in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to determine one , Byron comments is referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortunate . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald died in the program and tried to justify his remark saying that it was not his intention that she was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to exc@@ use me for the comment , whom I did after the women &apos;s swi@@ vel at the C@@ BC Olympics , to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have moved to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no mis@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ires about women who tried under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyers did not know where they should see , when a woman went out her clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try shelter . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she whis@@ pered , as she saw in her , moved her back and put it back to the shelf . &quot;
they continue along and tried four pairs of sub@@ h@@ osen in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried her under@@ pants before she placed her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and the business left without buying something . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the shop standing , it took a pair of sub@@ h@@ osen from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew her own shr@@ ubs and tro@@ users , and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not try to find a little discre@@ et place to do it - she was simply there , nau@@ gh@@ ty like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; every star@@ ring when she moved back to her , that her obviously didn &apos;t like her . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the same thing with three other sub@@ h@@ osen before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t like nothing , moved back and r@@ ushed out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b , that she observed someone - or about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants that she tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think anyone would have under@@ going home a person who had other person who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; wife Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull the clothes from the sale , after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate them to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants , and find out that another woman had her and moved back , and didn &apos;t have washed her . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against ce@@ ase@@ fire
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to go with armed smoking at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from front or back , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ e@@ wers for your rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; if you return from behind , you should be able to see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; &quot; go out from the Line &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knee in the suffering and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers face before pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the barrel and move back@@ wards , while they move the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; at Ang@@ rei@@ ah , approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and rotate them , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; just put the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle , before moving backward and the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it Me@@ z@@ ra@@ chi makes .
but remember that it is the most secure way to over@@ look your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel Ian Wright Sil@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the most poll@@ uted places in Europe
a British rice p@@ ushing his Imm@@ une System and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - by taking some of the most poll@@ uting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scra@@ pped his hand on a Euro @-@ loop , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse button of a pulling toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before leaving every object , he used a lumin@@ ance to show and show us what he will get . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought out some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ular button of a pulling toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely disgu@@ sting , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke of doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left what he ab@@ le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Wright was known for this to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by passing through the world , and did great things as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ets of toilets , the task posed its immune system under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a kid I was relatively in@@ worried about what my health is concerned and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slaughter water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was just righteous in his call . &quot;
the only thing he refused was an dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ strate showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to that , L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res is fresh @-@ washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to withdraw after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; who shows the bacterial amount of different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is inside it inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company sent Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended so that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
you claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting film , added : &quot; let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had instructed some of the things I have reli@@ ed on him , like the kind of Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things , with which it was easier to put Ian to finish her , and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a validation of validation recorded in 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents of lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent reported that they have to use at least occasionally products that contain any lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a thor@@ ough family left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a cost of £ 50,000 because they had terrorist their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were violent from their property , sho@@ cked employees of residential property were property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls remained stain@@ ed holes , wooden blocks were consumed , rub@@ b@@ ish was lubri@@ cated on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family were transferred and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears not to repair the apartment . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the mind that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to take into account , since this property is thought than not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their call is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , the meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had joined the family , in@@ timi@@ date of people , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams , inst@@ ances and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; in June , Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease contract , got an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished in circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the property where drugs were acted in the past , the wooden blocks were consumed . &quot;
&quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and regularly visited the police . &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ etes them and their partners were violent from the estate after they had a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntary surrender .
del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their lives was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They frigh@@ tened around anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we can tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was trying to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which the police was launched in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ taken side of the municipal house , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
that was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions had to look aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have cour@@ ageous for us and have paid us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours , and the message medi@@ ates that ant@@ iso@@ less behavi@@ ors will not be toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , located in one of the bedroom of the house following the del@@ og@@ ation on the floor . &quot;
workers of the house management are now en@@ cir@@ cling to the land@@ lords that sur@@ round the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was given a fine after it was found guilty of a drug of class B in trade @-@ view .
she claimed that the money for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born at a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; once they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many room walls of the house were coated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will not stop ten@@ ants who do not comply with the house order .
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w , out of the Devon and Corn@@ wall , divided the del@@ og@@ ation of a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not comply with the house order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can cause themselves without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who were done by such a behaviour . &quot;
&quot; the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall is never toler@@ ating criminal behavior , which continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists in Portugal is placed in panic after a ti@@ mid military jet is over@@ flying
s@@ uns@@ crew in Av@@ eiro and Portugal experienced the shock of her life
an port@@ ug@@ isi@@ esch@@ ke P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft of the Air Force put an incredible crash flight
&quot; the Air Force reported that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted on that no risk of security occurred . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment , in the sc@@ ary tourists start to get into panic after a ti@@ ck@@ ling jet over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost in tan@@ gible proximity to the sun@@ b@@ ans on the beach of Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers sp@@ ends when they began to make concerns about the noise of the dam@@ aging plants , without seeing what caused by the clouds to her . &quot;
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova in the vicinity of Av@@ eiro .
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ an@@ des , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers , posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice a very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that , as the plane would fall down to me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were placed in panic when the plane came out of darkness and was unbelie@@ v@@ ably flew .
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft was found on a training flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and so deeply flies that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet was slightly deeper than usual in the vicinity of the bad visibility , however , the air disp@@ ers@@ ed that safety at no time was endangered . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force announced that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions - heavy fog and bran@@ dr@@ ons - which had to fly as deep as its visibility . &quot;
the aircraft was located on a training flight where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : bar@@ ca with wor@@ ries to Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step of the first win in the new football @-@ season .
&quot; in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the Catal@@ ans compete against the FC Sev@@ ille , the return of three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
the Dou@@ ble@@ Win@@ ner needs to aband@@ on power with the under@@ le@@ aked cup@@ fin@@ alists and rainy Europe @-@ League champion among others on Ne@@ y@@ mar who cont@@ ends the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is also missing .
&quot; the German suffered a ten@@ sion@@ ing force in the training of the knee , with which the influence of Bar@@ ca has been clari@@ fied at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ ad@@ j@@ ett@@ ei@@ i have been one of the status as number one for two years .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique won &apos;t until now on a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er Ste@@ am put the advance into most of the candidates . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness status of the team that was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ ving stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. was not really convincing .
&quot; Sev@@ ille again , the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , stri@@ pped the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far , Barcelona is the record winner of the record winner in this candidate . &quot;
Ma Long in one &apos;s own league with table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - the Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis player .
&quot; on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated Rio de Janeiro on Thursday in a single @-@ sided final on his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title defended &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.@@ 4,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the world &apos;s first prize winner won the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; winner at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Me@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
thus it was clear that for the third time a Chinese had to take the single title in the sign of five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record only , between sentences and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
they withdrawn into the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their sho@@ ots in the fair competition alone .
&quot; the mat@@ ches up until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang was fol@@ ly said . &quot;
after the game pos@@ ited gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the Match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma was really strug@@ gling with his 28 year old opponent just in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he put the pace on the board and left Z@@ hang down only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , the awaited match was not expected . &quot;
but nevertheless they were enough to see stunning ballet change .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov had viol@@ ated a rift @-@ inj@@ ure , afterwards , in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately strug@@ gled with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , Sweden &apos;s Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Per@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become similar to the very high table old Olympia @-@ V@@ ated . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump is dre@@ amt of great problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to interv@@ ene their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave up weak@@ nesses of his campaign campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ safe m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire stated something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts still grow on its success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ sts
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor was used by the Democrats , Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state of state . &quot;
&quot; as at risk , Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he wants to stop to Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else to tell us as &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it does not succeed for him on the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is in order , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump should have threatened to submit money to support its electoral campaign , it should not present better conversion values . &quot;
&quot; instead of what , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress is stronger among the arms . &quot;
Olympia : three Sc@@ am Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IOC wants to establish an discipl@@ ines of discipl@@ ines .
Ken@@ yan for athletes born after the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
&quot; after an attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home to Kenya . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a ken@@ ian function was informed that the former Sprinter and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was given a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ itter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this is the team@@ leader Ken@@ ias has been reported by D@@ oping controllers .
the IA@@ AF World association has resear@@ ched the case for information on the case to use their own investigations into an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures in the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation &quot; , &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to d@@ oping control station and has turned out as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athl@@ ete who was on the list for training checks of the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted by the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he should have informed of the d@@ oping tests of his country on the D@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he allegedly was arrested by Nairobi at his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation since a long time at the IOC to numerous D@@ oping customers .
&quot; during the announcement of the IOC contra@@ cted by the IOC , more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio Olympics has been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the Vis@@ i@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; in front of the summer , the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had much pressure on African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; in the episode , WA@@ DA Kenya participated from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control conform with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports , ARD will always be collected , that in Kenya D@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality for sports bet@@ r@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; IOC member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had worked in the Russian Athletics Championships . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it could be proven that in this sport art area and systematically re@@ iter@@ ated . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes have then been excluded from the summer .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; Shakespeare &apos;s Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classic in the classic , and filled with the role of Mary a youth bay . &quot;
in the orchestra Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted under the leadership of the Venezuel@@ an Con@@ ductor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older Maria . &quot;
she rec@@ alls themselves with gro@@ oved with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she tells her in her song : &quot; I , Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ w Pre@@ t@@ ty and L@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I called as Roman in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor to work with her .
it is a tremendous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is as an exceptional artist , very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
&quot; one sees it in every of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important ! &quot;
Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism .
&quot; today we did not have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ go@@ cans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; these are the same themes , and today they are just as strong as it was . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London school girl who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school friends who left London last year in order to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ je@@ e said that her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was presum@@ ed that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ work of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ult@@ ana was 17 years old , and died after her family shortly after her family had to leave the war@@ ped land and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as warning and warning to others , that these are the risks involved in a war zone - people assume that this decision to meet , &quot; said A@@ sk@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , s@@ ult@@ ana and two other lessons from the East London went into a plane towards Turkey and then entered into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

Tre@@ ats wants to pay N@@ eck Calendar for &quot; Women and for Men
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere together for a 1970 @-@ year Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked human beings , they wish for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 to find the next generation of Top@@ models . &quot;
&quot; the Chief Editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his neck @-@ magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , since &quot; Play@@ boy for men is . &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently he is the mind that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of tim@@ eless and classical neck , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Shaw in a press release on the publication of Cal@@ endars . &quot;
women will participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .

Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass cur@@ s@@ als
&quot; whoever does not fit and praise the Erdo@@ gan , sits on packs of suit@@ cases , &quot; says the owner of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates a short term of tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , there could even become &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the prohib@@ itions Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass cur@@ s@@ ation to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany if the Erdo@@ gan regime continued to fight against the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the Order &apos;s president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k in the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had passed Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ sts with criminal actions , 500,000 Kurds are going to escape within Turkey . &quot;
after the coup p@@ utsch would still be added to the sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ elle ethnic Turks .
many will begin to start in Europe when they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that mig@@ rate refugees , in their own country , said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Staff , compl@@ ained by Syrian Arab troops in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ itic cities . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the remaining Kurds on the remaining Kurds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already extinct in the last hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government demanded that the government is positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ ase &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement is also afraid of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition . &quot;
fire mark@@ up as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever pra@@ ises himself and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packs of suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Middle Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already declared the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all have been authorized to be accepted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , you don &apos;t find it before war , poverty or mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are only politically , so by state @-@ of @-@ government , individual . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer campaign and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sever@@ ity parliament had already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
because of the so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land@@ sc@@ ams - that is bit@@ ing . &quot;
the loc@@ als who are to be convinced by the fighters are on vacation .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country are on the way to Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers are spread , spread the posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and spread out at the end of the voices , only tired . &quot;
&quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must still be handed over to people over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can tell it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly evident in p@@ olls behind the CDU . &quot;
exciting is how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ s cut down and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ary .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ ung@@ ed a little with the people , as well as his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , all of you &quot; We create &quot; the rise of pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him a beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its top @-@ edge candidates , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she has invited twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel in addition to gener@@ als ; Merkel member of the German Parliament is located in the Nor@@ theast .
&quot; the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia , Mecklenburg Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other states , &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but there was also no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theastern CDU does not aband@@ on the usual election events on market areas and shopping centers with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , as co@@ ca@@ ert , plays only one &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also not@@ ices that you have taken the basis on the country , that it has to be very strict , to find a wire back to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : in the times of the country , hardly exists . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU election co@@ ert Kok@@ ert to his fel@@ low@@ soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; they have to go where there are we@@ h@@ eth , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , the Social Democrats was last at 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under Af@@ rec@@ tal ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD won with 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the green , small party with seven percent in p@@ olls , can make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e and put out their choice of campaigns to the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; campaign , &quot; it calls the state president Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green elec@@ trol@@ leys go to national stim@@ ates among the tourists .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gers and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
her impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed of speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for the charge of the construction work , which starts at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and only at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are omni@@ pot@@ able praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite c@@ ud@@ dly , &quot; says El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet petrol station . &quot;
that is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the building site could be moved from the weekend to the half of the year , until the end of October will all be ready . &quot;
&quot; the Ent@@ ities of the Construction , which is responsible for the construction of heating , is praised . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was taken on Monday to the south , and also the lock of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been relaxed . &quot;
&quot; now , the citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides . &quot;
the exclusion by the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the assistant director of the rehabilitation manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach &apos;s road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ ons had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sle@@ dges were sought and rather than the signs . &quot;
&quot; what led to that , some trucks in the living areas have been missed . &quot;
&quot; as well , the speed lim@@ it@@ ments were not adher@@ ed to the community called the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable rop@@ es , &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made herself on location about the situation . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute lit@@ tered .
the quick@@ est was at 77 hours in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the building has been moved on site , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for business professionals at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to open the road again . &quot;
&quot; in the cards , business people don &apos;t like to watch . &quot;
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ renovation with them has led to sales in sales , everybody is asking you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less are affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; , so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most light decline , &quot; but also , a dream of course is missing . &quot;
the local gri@@ ds along the road are the strongest .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words . &quot;
that is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only it , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers are missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be glad about every euro sales .
the sales revenues increased to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the road alloy have thrown his operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
he must have dismissed the half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , the policy would have been re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt acted on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise agreed by the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they also have the dis@@ advantages that contribute to the restoration . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other coun@@ ties , where there was so much more generous . &quot;
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , since 17@@ 15 family business has been located here , he refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; however , other regular guests can now look less common because of the complicated traffic control . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the greatest crisis , which has experienced a restaurant in her long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terror attack on laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a job status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ ciliation .
&quot; all its proposals are reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security packages . &quot;
they do not require anybody .
&quot; others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also contributed to that .
&quot; as the interior minister , however , was located to results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère opened a little time before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but these are the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , pro@@ found@@ ly announced that a new security authority should take care of the un@@ packing communication , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU regulations on air passenger data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities are also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second call for proposals who have not been doing so far with the SPD : he wants to place sympath@@ y for terror groups , and Ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CDU man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it can still be liable for reasonable and demanding nothing , which has no chances in mind . &quot;
some new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they are partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities for the detention of people from deportation .
&quot; refugees who are fet@@ ched targeted in the country , then they should check their smartphones before they check out social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; for asylum seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some more worse than to date - about such , commit criminal off@@ ences or their papers consci@@ ously to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
some people still works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some point - at the ine@@ quality of Ged@@ ul@@ ted for example - the question arises : what does this mean to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it does not allow themselves to speak that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
&quot; moreover , many people in view of the high refugees have been concerned about safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that are deep@@ ened to people , once again did not decide in election campaign times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the safegu@@ ards is great .
&quot; and yes , there are constitu@@ ent competitions . &quot;
&quot; Union and SPD bring safety in position , therefore , increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; over the past few days , there went up between both parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some global Unions of the Minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also tired of reconc@@ iling tones here .
from a turn off the double pass he doesn &apos;t stop .
we satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to re @-@ commit , be not useful . &quot;
&quot; and at a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional law concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional to all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to show yet . &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ claim the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party chair Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes first to talk to talk , saying : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still very limited .
&quot; despite the diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the figures worldwide rise . &quot;
but not in all markets there is round .
&quot; in the feedback action , there is host around a concept . &quot;
Volkswagen will start for deliveries to deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ ways can continue to show up a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the VW @-@ brand new VW @-@ brand @-@ brand fe@@ eb@@ led mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the sale of sales , such as the D@@ ax not@@ ched company . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars and 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , the deliveries increased by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann launched the weaker figures from July , primarily on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has been given in some core markets through &quot; altered economic setting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote ran to the exit from the EU , explained an spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas are first escal@@ ated , there is also a min@@ us to be@@ ech . &quot;
large supports for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is continuing with the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus 0.9 % to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles are available . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , the Group leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to point out a sales team from January to July . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen provided more than 1.3 percent of vehicles in this period , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software testing .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to re@@ armament in workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of the re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; according to the upgrade of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the bus station will take the customer to the re@@ armament of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certification , but did not talk of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company &apos;s roads . &quot;
reason to be legal entities .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a warranty for fitted diesel models .
this was confirmed on Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; from the transport of the Ministry of Commerce , it was confirmed that this meeting was given . &quot;
&quot; VW has completed the editions of my Commission of In@@ quiry , and KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has adopted the guarantee that there will be no deteri@@ or@@ ations in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after re@@ armament , and all typical relevant vehicles will remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business circuits .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the option that customers will come back for example half a year after the upgrade with an engine damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; it is also important in the customer interests to avoid any damage caused by any other damage , which is nothing to do with the cancellation of any warranty , as it was called . &quot;
therefore I don &apos;t use the VW &apos;s term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich spar@@ es in future criminal law - as the second institute in Germany .
&quot; banking director Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just about 139 customers that par@@ ked 40 million euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of a single incident and sees it no signal : normal savings would have to be afraid to pay for their austerity criminal prosecution .
&quot; banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay 0.4 per cent penalty . &quot;
this charge applies the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September to private and corporate customers for deposits over 100.000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; he has been offering 40 million euros in the meantime , who could be withdrawn from one day on the other , and could not be able to deny that . &quot;
&quot; those lying in me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the manager . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for every million 4000 Euro . &quot;
he now aband@@ on the costs after the urs@@ urs@@ ing principle .
&quot; the cash is easy to get in the bra@@ ckets of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t even have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers have understanding and changes in other projects .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the cooperative society of Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes substantial costs in all banks .
&quot; to carry alone , be &quot; operating business permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for cont@@ est@@ ing , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ al interest rates for deposits above three million Euros , the Thuring@@ ian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg was made headlines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive manager of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay private customers &quot; covering for in@@ sol@@ es , the competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is a cliff which is rich in wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can be a small bank to the problem , if they are free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ sey , R@@ ott@@ ach E@@ sters , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and business@@ men , live in the region . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria &quot; are currently no further banks known to the cooperative association of Bavaria , which calculate an extra charge for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , the president of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had declared : &quot; the threshold , to go to the negatives , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was hard , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany will not be liked in the width .
Dest@@ ination sheets : who actually buys sound@@ boards ?
lon@@ ely males love middle ages .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to comm@@ itting it , in order to over@@ look him under the p@@ seudonym non @-@ aging defects of men , this statement runs from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the vast records of sound records are not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which we want to welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects but on Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who recently bought a record recently , are all pre@@ ference according to the age between 45 and 54 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely one group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older plat@@ ters keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a message report on TV , the camera would follow me while I stand in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , before I stand , my hands hold and something determin@@ ant as : &quot; so let &apos;s let us take a further look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s throw a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly added to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent seller have been located , there are still a hand@@ ful fantastic record specialist . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops , and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have ca . 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by my house ) , dress the walls of his house . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy boards which he had appeared and again bought items that he sold when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
that is my Light .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also not@@ ices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the discussions that I have led , people usually have par@@ don@@ ed so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to a specific age of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop , such as phon@@ ica , to realize that record stores have a so@@ othing community of so@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took a violation of the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record enthusiasts will be overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of confi@@ dential records , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is with me as a collector , so I think there is so many people . &quot;
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; fl@@ avo@@ red a staff from a record stack .
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who have bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , whereas 7 % of those who own a record , do not own record players . &quot;
at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I flo@@ cked through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works on sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle ages ) , has noted a &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own record players but I &apos;d like to buy a radio record , so I &apos;d like to set it to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musicians . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; they are younger people , not older who first get slowly . &quot;
&quot; fet@@ ch , which has dedicated the sound board almost a whole floor , has an audience audience when I am clean . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and women middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts New Year &apos;s latest syn@@ thes@@ ia instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ ities at the customer .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but brand mental trau@@ mat@@ a are badly det@@ ectable , if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in the shop and viewed the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes a man@@ ne@@ ster@@ bum@@ ble@@ bee as a big one .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so the collecting records are not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer , or to any way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; &quot; she drives with a loved gro@@ wer . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; as I give the ticket to brave the je@@ ans hot@@ line , I observe a group of young teenage boys before a father and daughter to think about a Cro@@ sley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody can see it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; however , considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers can send in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money as others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my resear@@ ches revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they let themselves , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while at the rigid ga@@ ze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 years old wrong moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders nothing of middle ages . &quot;
&quot; Greenland is the longest living verteb@@ ra - video level , the longest living in Greenland &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer about demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French dish rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in case of a trial hearing this week , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ as shops in which persons within the camp of goods , from cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dresser services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vis@@ c@@ or restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid for tax and fire risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by government supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need to offer .
&quot; in L@@ ille , a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ atory businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation speed measurement : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new Flash units are tested , which should be particularly effective effectively . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ ending En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to rehabil@@ itated bridges using a temporary speed setting , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary Bl@@ aker to comply with the speed limit . &quot;
a lasting mobile body can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring mode five days . the case data will be encrypted using a modem .
&quot; in addition to laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via several tracks . &quot;
&quot; monitor variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments , as well as passage @-@ drive according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor . &quot;
&quot; in high @-@ driven condition , one can move the trailer with any car with a trailer hook . &quot;
&quot; to make it easy for it , it is lowered into measuring mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ eled and by the way also marks disappear . &quot;
a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ot@@ gun from V@@ and@@ alism .
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities are also fl@@ ashing up with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year . &quot;
Britain cat@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a corrupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ vot@@ al stage in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ ends , liner run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic aille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was won by the non @-@ too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to her in the finals . &quot;
&quot; however , Fiji had struck a 15 @-@ man team in the form of that form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a consol@@ ation for GB , but it probably won &apos;t be that at least a bridge tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head of England . &quot;
GB had a difficult way behind .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost some Ryan any game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens . &quot;
they are only lost one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji began wonderful and left the GB@@ S of fun ab@@ outs .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . an , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au invaded the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly used the ball .
&quot; a he@@ avi@@ est T@@ ackle von Mitchell stops the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete in the right corner a touch down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for UK .
Nak@@ ag@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ dic@@ ated through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is so , when Fiji was born to play , the 7 was to play while GB . &quot;
it is so .
&quot; UK lead basic changes to half @-@ time by and completed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton started a try for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game was already long in favor of the South Pacific , whose fans sang , b@@ anners , and d@@ anced at the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame translated the i dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff sounds , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB k@@ ic@@ ously defeated in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; previously , in the semi@@ finals , Fiji had defeated 20 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ dark match from the race - British conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late @-@ late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by combat with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory
there will be no more power@@ less gold than these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first rowing area to the last , 220 harsh h@@ ie@@ ve , who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only the Bei@@ den , who were sitting in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the ech@@ o of the coach Robin Williams , was always present as she became the second Olympic champion in a branch without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that gave such a scale . &quot;
&quot; its domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all of its 3@@ 9.@@ 95 non @-@ wareh@@ ous@@ ed use , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete , which reflects on the surface with the elegance of pigs , which does not reflect the kind of tri@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on against hel@@ pers , which make up the difference , make the difference and it was no more helpful as the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , he spreads out everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could be the treatment beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin the interru@@ ption of a minimum , if that is the correct term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to leave it again soon . &quot;
it was a inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was at the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it a more bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ fertility of victory , their first thoughts were addressed to Williams , who had a annoying morning to talk a little more than anything else , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning who was in use as a cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much of me that means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person to exercise or wish a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were not able to keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams come from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot to reserve . &quot;
we were caught at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let it take away .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking forward to make something great . &quot;
&quot; today we wanted no fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before it will make decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with TV advent@@ ur@@ ers Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ eine &quot; , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian far exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fr@@ aud@@ acious drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example for the large water producers .
so it was at a time ago in the origin@@ ator of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later the Aqu@@ arian forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia prevailed .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ar Group sailed &quot; Bavarian far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ verband , 28 of them as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , commune Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes some 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are the congregations of the church , Breit@@ brun@@ n , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s Mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up as a water tower in 1985 and has been appointed President of the Pur@@ ge Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational operations , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding events they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land @-@ piece processes in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the integration of water pipes . &quot;
there have been no breast@@ feeding and I &apos;ve always recorded improvements because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
&quot; in their foli@@ age , they praised the faithful , reliable and correct service for 31 years . &quot;
he used himself with lots of heart bl@@ ut for its purpose of water and he used the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he acted as a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ar Group in front of the Water@@ forum of the district of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
he has received very much recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the other hand , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons , who worked for 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water soft@@ ly and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his perspective he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the association .
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment , however , were the pipe break at the high container on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; at minus 17 degrees we had to work through the whole night , so the villages could be provided with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained once , because one filled the sky@@ scra@@ per of P@@ ett@@ stadt with battles . &quot;
the management of pot@@ able water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from a lou@@ der who took over from Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cra@@ cked and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains scra@@ pped from additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the green power funding , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; in the liberation of the Renewable Energy Environmental Law , the Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German general newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad we could finally reach it after two years .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission planned to first use steel producers , which use gases from the high furnace for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
the steel industry threatened additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry associations .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ . now there is now a fundamental certificate of the EU Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when generators are replaced in steel works , a EEG @-@ conversion of 20 percent will be replaced . &quot;
but also these will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission for suit@@ ability .
this makes the status Quo of the previous regulation largely established .
Gabriel was a special meaning of the successful work of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel , the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; further needs to follow . &quot;
&quot; IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann , stated in Frankfurt on the reform of the emissions &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation intensi@@ fied as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand , cast steel on the global market . &quot;
European manufacturer t@@ oss Chinese steel concerts price d@@ umping .
&quot; during this spring year , the situation has relaxed . &quot;
&quot; to a show , import duties on imp@@ lications effect , for the other , economic views in China have penet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , how sustainable the price recovery is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was careful on Thursday .
at last the prices were stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to close the closure of individual works as well .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced nearly six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic association of steel were held on Friday . &quot;
&quot; following a short increase in May , the completed amount returned to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been reduced by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increasing output in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : we are doing senior citizens &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching position she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior citizen . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of live , says . &quot;
&quot; next door , she is doing something good in their health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; since S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German senior liga . &quot;
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with equ@@ in@@ ths the joy of music describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; through regular meeting , senior social contacts can link and maintain . &quot;
&quot; because often , social and family structures often trigger the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also done Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; arrange and arrange for the others to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the one . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; whoever calls his lungs as regular , is not so fast in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even if it comes to receive the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the German labor community of senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them . &quot;
L@@ enz is frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in older people many memories are often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
&quot; due to Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies , people themselves dis@@ car@@ ded itself to long @-@ related events . &quot;
&quot; while singing the head , L@@ enz is demanded of a special performance . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentr@@ ating on their own voice and to concentrate on a pre@@ set rhythm - that &apos;s a great cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; elderly people , who alone live alone , can not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is recognition , which one lear@@ ns through the singing choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through the singing choir .
&quot; to show itself : if I do for something for something , I will get better and awake about myself - these experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 sin@@ ning people , who sounds there if a sound goes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , seniors , various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; somebody sings from the familiar circle in a senior case , you can easily plug . &quot;
many cities also offer views of cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
who wants to sing in a church choir may turn directly to the church or church council .
many senior cho@@ irs you can also find on the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet computer . &quot;
&quot; who loves to sing , should always be connected to a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - it is true for each age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover in which the effect of cat &apos;s baby has grown on adult animals .
&quot; at their surprise , the male didn &apos;t let the males get cold - however , they stopped in the difference to the females always . &quot;
female cats may detect the earth level of cat &apos;s baby at the mi@@ thing of little ones .
&quot; they respond more than 10 percent qu@@ icker on foli@@ age of K@@ itt@@ ens , who choose to be found in great distress , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; cr@@ aters ad@@ mitt@@ edly react to the che@@ ers of K@@ itt@@ ens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sts of less and strongly er@@ reg@@ ed young for the males either non @-@ perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams with the pressures of their help . &quot;
a total of nine adult cat and eight co@@ her@@ ds@@ men were observed from the animal preser@@ vation of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a couple of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in addition to others , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ eds of stronger kit@@ ten , which were additionally lifted . &quot;
researchers keep their results despite the low sample for sa@@ sa@@ ge@@ ously .
&quot; all females , even those who had no other offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned out faster to the loud@@ speaker when he played a very rainy kit@@ ten .
this ability may be born or evol@@ ving with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males ever acted at all , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise . &quot;

Po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
he is accused of being a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , there will be an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already with the suspension of the exceptional trial after the crash attempt in July , the government had not imp@@ aired the everyday life of standardi@@ zation should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
football is not being made even before the football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
&quot; accordingly , he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America in the meantime . &quot;
Sü@@ me@@ r is supposed to be a member of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan is responsible for the coup attempt .
&quot; although , for 90 days , the forecast is valid for 90 days even until October , indeed that most of the Turks have no impact on most of the Turks . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
Sports is - like all the country - split in supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; traditionally , fans of the club club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not count towards the friends of the President . &quot;
&quot; but in the history of the Turks , but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict ref@@ us@@ al of military aches . &quot;
even fans even agree - no matter if their heart strikes for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ winning &quot; Gala &quot; will arrive again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot;
&quot; its sporty value in Cologne , Cologne , exhibited its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
he scored the 1 : 0 victory in the final game against Fen@@ her@@ ah@@ ce .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; said it : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season on outstanding manner and secured the trop@@ hy in its crew .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also come up early in Europe &apos;s league . &quot;
&quot; in the Southern Li@@ g , it was only to rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the playing year was better .
&quot; most of all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 seasonal season , came the base to the 14th title at the end of the season . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans definitely hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the AC Florence had not been posted to the P@@ utsch attempt at AC Florence , after the coup attempt at the P@@ utsch@@ er , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storms would have to be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of its estimated annual sal@@ aries to 7.5 million euros of the estimated annual sal@@ aries . we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
&quot; despite d@@ oping : these athletes have even medals chances at Olympia in Rio , &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ om in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
other athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about them - they are fighting in Rio for medals .
d@@ oping down marks the headlines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained by a D@@ oping lock , took off the start just before the games ( 100 meters of breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly with mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; it was a quir@@ ky scene : with a raised smile , she was proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a result , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a cycl@@ one . &quot;
but there are also numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who take the start to the Rio Olympics in the Rio Olympics .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed for two times due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his B@@ ann the Olympic champion from 2004 and Ex @-@ champion is even faster than before , it is above 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the biggest ch@@ allen@@ ger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to be seen in 2010 after taking the pain of pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , you had had a strong tooth aches , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship from 2010 to 2016 tested positive impact on forbidden voting rights meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the ignor@@ ance and was locked six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion more than 400 m , has been tested positive and has been closed for 21 months . &quot;
a means to increase penis enlargement is responsible for Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ bill , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete , so many medals were identified . &quot;
&quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after which it was diagnosed with him testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
meanwhile the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave the Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid di@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 due to a verdict of the International Sport@@ Court of Justice CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he lies rank two of the space list .
&quot; Liu Hong Kong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record woman and gold fav@@ ors have been tested positive only in May , but may nevertheless start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion in the world , hints at the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement found that the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran out on July 13 . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand arise with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ eller , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; I have suffered chi@@ ves , and be treated in the hospital , but have already left this again . &quot;
she plans her hom@@ ebo@@ und for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island Ph@@ uk@@ et and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Foreign Ministry stand in continuous contact with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; in some 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a cut @-@ off two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai police were killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three countries and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ res went up , and another person was killed , according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , a bomb explo@@ ded by Ph@@ uk@@ et . &quot;
in the Det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular seaside beach Pat@@ ong was injured after a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded over a municipal staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the demol@@ ition had gone into the air before the prec@@ in@@ ct of the coastal police into the air . &quot;
finally det@@ on@@ ations called Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on along the south @-@ east coast several injured .
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; said army @-@ eral Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday to journalists . &quot;
we expect that it is a co @-@ coordinated attack .
it was too early to express itself to possible moti@@ ves - probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern with the attacks which is typical for the bombing of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; by contrast , Thai police declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; in fact , one would rather say that the bombs were put out of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
the authorities have kept secret references to the coming attacks in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and the places .
be un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police rejected their officials throughout the country , security around the important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks , but they usually judge not against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after reason of reason bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to be deb@@ ated to the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high level risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ xen and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel in these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
&quot; a few days after a controversial referendum on Thursday and Friday , a few days after a controversial referendum on a military jun@@ ta . &quot;
this dre@@ aming the military in the coming years as well as in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs be an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps himself good to have led the Kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the handle for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
&quot; just one year ago in Bangkok , a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine had been killed in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the vision of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the Constitutional Court have also made the Group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ities Movement &apos; programme for aspir@@ ations against the Freedom of Democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , we diff@@ use the immigrants Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement too .
&quot; the &quot; Ident@@ itarian Movement &quot; is a group of group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; she is turning against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass flows &quot; and the loss of its own identity . &quot;
&quot; nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ities &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely tied to the country &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ itarian Movement &apos; try to collect their target group , where she says , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional System . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts , speaking with you@@ thful speech often , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the workers of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
that is not an ad@@ vert advertising for their own cause .
propaganda is to speak emotional to people .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , in several federal states , there were reports about contacts from the &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; of Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts this type is only relevant to some point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , changes and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so decisive is whether such individuals have remote influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee quot@@ ations , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new rights terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we &apos;ve found out in recent years that it can give right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can be quite , that other legal form groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ ves . &quot;
but a German @-@ wide control of legal terrorism but not recognis@@ able .
the existing groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about it , and did not worry about that many handles on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not previously known as a criminal , politically motivated off@@ ender or supporters of the right @-@ scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences that have previously failed with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or left , who have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te became an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic sculptures or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ se@@ eable s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures . &quot;
he just disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral interest in the social networks . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his prec@@ urs@@ or with a return of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ presented countries known .
&quot; because in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia , most athletes run , Hab@@ it just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a &quot; welfare state &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun , &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; was funny about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ is@@ ons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i looked for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; finally , Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time . &quot;
&quot; the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned just eight months before the Olympics , and had never completed a long distance before the competition . &quot;

&quot; should there be nothing at the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative vide@@ ot@@ ape . &quot;

&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , would be the relatively no matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will be either folding , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV company CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not abundant for him on the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;

accidents - bus sli@@ t in cr@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; during an accident involving 43 seniors as passengers , in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) , eight people were injured . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to cover their data according to a opposite light , which was partly on the road . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ances came to the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ spo@@ iled trav@@ ellers returned from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the truck driver and possible witnesses to report on the police .
fees per cubic meters of se@@ wage is from 1 October 2016 to the range of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; according to a final calculation , the se@@ wage plant in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was determined by the budget of budget by the agriculture and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that covers sub@@ covers for this se@@ wage plant . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to operate the facilities cost @-@ covering . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from the world trade , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to attack deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the board of re@@ funds for se@@ wage plants of the market town . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and sub@@ missions from the previous period of cal@@ ming period will be the same . &quot;
&quot; the other three se@@ wage increases , Schmidt thus established that it is relatively small for all three se@@ wage plants with very small se@@ wage , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters each year . &quot;
&quot; as a result , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs would be applied for several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the se@@ wage san@@ itation is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; due to their age , rehabilitation and repair charges are still in a considerable circum@@ ference for all three systems . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world stake , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to any damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and over@@ taken during the pond zone L@@ opp after nearly 20 years of operation the first sep@@ tic pond had to be installed and an additional ventilation may be installed in order to be able to maintain water@@ legal requirements . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenditure , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs came to be considered in the new Kal@@ cul@@ mination period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still under the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that in the low se@@ wage plant in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt expanded the market municipality of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plant in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will remain silent after the view of stone houses on duration , especially since one could not expand the supply area of the san@@ itation cover Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to extend these plants , because it is about de@@ fied facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria ranks for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria came 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October of last year , considered a positive 0.2 % . &quot;
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
inflation rates since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in consumer goods received by the following groups : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances , and rout@@ ines ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained like in the pre@@ mon@@ at of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ised
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel over races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it enables the Snap@@ chat around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already borders on the absur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are distinctive , autonomous tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fers a day . &quot;
all Mis@@ tr@@ itte arrive to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised criticism in the past ; in which they were accused of prop@@ agate the app Black@@ face convey@@ ing or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; as this week , some Us@@ ers struck a filter which gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted teeth , false teeth and enlighten@@ ed che@@ eks , called it some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing of platinum . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy raised to a larger problem , that the company has de@@ vers@@ atility . &quot;
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat informed that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; the exterior , experienced rac@@ ism , remin@@ ded the filter of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others have chosen the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , an Korean American art student , whose Twe@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter was viol@@ ating and said to be un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ top of a very opposed Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not solid , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yellow light was pulled down . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural proud was crossed .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration of integration , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older counter@@ parts , could rather be expected to expect sen@@ sibility . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters is created , it is much more difficult for a user , so it &apos;s more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu on Thursday in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided that he is working as a product manager and engineering in medium for media , asked her Snap@@ chat account to del@@ eting others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a telephone interview in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that racial cont@@ empor@@ aries may reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices at snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and finished her attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ux@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either , they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions they are certain or feel comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; the company does not publish numbers on di@@ vers@@ ity of its workforce , and points to its status as a private company . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently hired a personnel responsible for the population groups and on internal integration . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military deployment , ISIS Secret Service information , states the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military @-@ members of the United States Central Command set up alignment information to draw a optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have been the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Committee , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , reported how Vor@@ ump@@ tions had changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news intelligence information that were typically re@@ acted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , identified regularly a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism to be the actual states before the site , cited a newspaper article by other news services . &quot;
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses will be presented by our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
guide errors in Cent@@ Com are sufficient to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; even though there is no direct evidence that government pointed out to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their fore@@ heads , a optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements from the Congress were clearly higher than the facts , &quot; presented the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com employee publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq continues to remain under the control of Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress of the Kansas , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the mid @-@ year 2015 , the main point of the Central Command was changed to reflect a threat to ISIS by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life , after they had been played , analysts compl@@ ained about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the general inspec@@ torate of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Democratic Members of the Intelligence Agency released their own findings , that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a revised process for the creation of retro@@ active evaluation ass@@ ess@@ ments on Isi@@ l and the Iraqi Security services , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of nach@@ richt@@ en@@ ue reports , &quot; the mor@@ ality of analysts and &quot; gave a little room for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats raised , no evidence on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts have found in regards to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the conference of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations into the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ torate that were accepted according to Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon of the Pentagon , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence should not comment on reports , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tions were still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; experts at times could quite di@@ verg@@ ating opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the Intelligence and the Ministry of Defence welcomes a controversial discussion of these important issues of the national defence . &quot;
the investigation on the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have stopped the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honour@@ able ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises . &quot;
&quot; the critic@@ isms concerning the Islam@@ ist state recall twi@@ sting about more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written one about the recommendations of many analysts , saw only a small occupying troops in Iraq and to make a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the government states that contrary to the statements of the government &apos;s government proposals , no significant impact on the financing of the terrorist group had taken no significant impact on the financing of the terrorist group since this pro@@ vis@@ or@@ atory refin@@ eries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , has been critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative Assembly for his superior positive assessment of war in a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command in Central Command . Joseph L. V@@ otel was replaced .
&quot; the United States win fourth match in the field of women , a show@@ down with the UK before &quot;
&quot; a day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever had done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are same in their group with the British in the first place , which remains un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will hit the first round on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals . the game will decide which the two teams will get their first and second place in their group .
&quot; the first @-@ placed team will go a bit longer out of the way , leading the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game can go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story , four years after they arrived at the last London Games over the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ schläger in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the United States . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they did not qualify for the cad@@ res . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ horse in London that we have now .
we have sh@@ out the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the tor@@ rent in the first half of the game with a back@@ drop of the se@@ am .
&quot; India has gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
it performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate to make a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first round of the tournament for door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events will feel durable and un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , a shaving time between competition and gri@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; it is , as the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which will protect from the wrist@@ watch to the tri@@ mmer to the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queu@@ e in the coffee shop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y , or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female of women with dimples , would definitely be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and charity TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ law@@ less . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame is not illuminated any event .
&quot; next to the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ gun shoot , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may it be long .
&quot; but if I should make a humble arguments for my particular favor@@ ing , let me take the attention on the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so many that I had asked , did not know that it is a Olympic port . &quot;
that could be also regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never gained a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal for London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain outer char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a little bit enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ ously potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ or of his never @-@ going ast@@ oun@@ ds - but also the gra@@ zie of the gy@@ mn@@ asium and divers , the two sports that combines it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means that much means &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asc@@ ending champion jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ genuine and Sal@@ tos ) before it landing at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympics , you will be evaluated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two hundred athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts will have to go for gold in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go back and down , down and down to the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the television broadcast also another pol@@ ite destination : the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the targeted dispute is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir even a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I myself have to watch this play as a bit tired .
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers a breath . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ sky is up .
a backward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly heavier than an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then slopes down again , then effort@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant raising of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men of the Saturday , likewise at 13.00 . &quot;
&quot; N@@ BC will slip back as part of an afternoon drive on both days from 14.00 . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ seen in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his back to air rin@@ d and new fan community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long in the United States &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators call for political changes in Ethiopia to overthrow the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that zig protests were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia right now to break ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months protests against the government , protests against the country and far more territories . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people climbed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
the response of the government was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot on anti @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos on protests , probably from the last or early of this year , show how safety sle@@ ute young people stro@@ kes with sho@@ cks while they were forced to make a hand@@ held against a wall . &quot;
&quot; now , the head of the UN authority for Human Rights demands a further investigation . &quot;
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and future will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the head of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the west .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , in order to combat terror attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in a remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new pose in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was all other than an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ sidents were effective to silence . &quot;
many were sent into exile or sent to the prison or driven into the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and these no other options have to protest , breaks it out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints which cover everything from the ground up to the thro@@ ws in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following an extensive crit@@ ici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ten@@ sions rise along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this z@@ ag , controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced in recent years , could benefit from turbul@@ ence and can be armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the bitter@@ ness after years is now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians had been able to communicate with social media , since cheap smartphones were increasingly used and improved online services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies to hide where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians said they were gathered to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since branches prosp@@ ering the am@@ har@@ ma , which come from branches of predominantly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and in flat regions . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are entitled to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; according to his death in 2012 , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , became the Ethiop@@ ian prime minister until his death in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly pos@@ ing in it to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contra@@ ctors to make opponents and make it un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is missing in this basic skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take hold of the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south , unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Uganda . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of protest@@ ers prot@@ ested the government according to the facts alleged by the government and then stolen from the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ cia , many protests were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning , like the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ship , as well as its measur@@ able progress in the poverty line . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal ab@@ normal@@ ities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous form .
&quot; last month protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic town , of tig@@ ray managed shops and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray will always be more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests in the US and other Western allies are put into an independent position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights via the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly intends to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to support its ally in a volatile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama . ISIS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy on Friday , who oppos@@ ing his campaign that his multi @-@ repeated alleg@@ ation , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fying new questions on the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republi@@ can , whether he is able to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its competitors , who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain to the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating on Wednesday evening he had done Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpre@@ t the President and Mrs. Clinton . &quot;
&quot; but on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , to which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the exc@@ use is completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to do the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ un@@ elt down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to fail@@ ing values to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton said speaking in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m for his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he moved to himself strong criticism , when he said that the Russians should use Mrs. Clin@@ t emails , but later he explained &quot; Natural , &quot; I said later . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then returned to need .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how specific messages are taken of his fans , as they arrive , and then may be clear &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication teacher , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think too , he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of counter@@ sharp@@ ening the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump adopted a still corro@@ sive tone , since its revolution has gone back further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a lead with a huge margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attemp@@ ting to exc@@ use his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics to understand his statements or false sense of hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he has intensi@@ fied the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal complic@@ ity in the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ oking his testimony . &quot;
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent princip@@ als , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says is legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was interro@@ gated on the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ grounds , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he departed the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government served as Foreign Minister Clinton , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister to spread out the situation in the Middle East , under control . &quot;
&quot; before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before them to ride on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , j@@ aw@@ ful &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ies about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps dis@@ ap@@ ologies than just another proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the Presidential Office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ uous Café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which was no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , introduced in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native con@@ fer@@ ed it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is Change , but I can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is change , it is also novel@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has accepted Wi @-@ Fi and accepted Credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafés , owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
&quot; he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and stayed there until the end . &quot;
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained many things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are nature reserves .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ alled stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed down through prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they had moved to Green@@ point , it would take the way to themselves . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee pot , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that the coffee and culture was in the ver@@ b , which was right in me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even though they ordered that day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and ordered always the same as the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day like a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal always gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , eggs and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he was not a p@@ low above that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; actually , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has actually offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee of coffee . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighbouring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new delay is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the operator felt a new coffee like a return journey . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell this , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a fine alarm clock , President Roosevelt took a Fai@@ ble for refined del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen on Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Wass@@ il@@ tur@@ tle . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat modest , filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the United States during Z@@ iegel@@ sberg in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential home at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of the American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; you showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ eper snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District which has already been in business since the stock market crash of 1929 . &quot;
&quot; sealed man , 54 , ordered a fresh squee@@ zer with olive oil while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; when the reporter ordered Hack@@ fry , this couple found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ sberg . &quot;
&quot; there were pean@@ ut bread , meat lo@@ af and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from a ingredient and a little cheaper which stre@@ aks the ingredient .
&quot; imagine , so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner . &quot;
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cook for male Fel@@ dar@@ ers and it was served freshly baked past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who were sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the paths which the country went on to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time in which the food for the Americans was a central , r@@ ins@@ ed theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ed food : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and kit@@ ten were used to basic food , the K@@ asser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful kind , food remains re@@ confident &quot; , &quot; it was mir@@ ro@@ red because it could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients amongst a creative sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry ob@@ st .
&quot; the meat , which was the center of the American kitchen , has been a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; such bl@@ ends were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction came before taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared a court from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the laundry facilities .
&quot; as never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ed bud@@ get@@ ed - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ol@@ iti@@ vity &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ mat@@ ge sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treat .
&quot; in particular , the reports about the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ cake @-@ meal post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa peas@@ ant cuisine of his kitchen , he pointed out like the million@@ th heavy man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he loved continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tu@@ x .
he was a great real@@ ist@@ rate .
&quot; President Roosevelt might have committed the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ise his stomach with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , this is a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt to emphas@@ ize that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with food to deal was rejected , once the country came back into the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy focuses on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as science on food . &quot;
the pair gave a better understand in writing the book the eating habits of brick @-@ in @-@ law - for example how food could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
brick : &quot; did people actually get sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ hur@@ dle case .
&quot; after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they stri@@ pped and Co@@ e made a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , the President Roosevelt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , a modest song to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no proposed cream , just pl@@ ums , little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something to sh@@ out a spo@@ ons in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ther , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed at bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died for a bomb attack on the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that had saved nearly 60,000 people according to the picture @-@ newspaper . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers make their own life on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him at a 11 hour rescue from a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians to the bright symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; however , as heroes , he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had talked about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have thrown four façade bombs across the Alz@@ adia area , one was filled with chlor@@ inated gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now kill the po@@ ison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare scenery .
Greenland is usually only in the winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea on board of the research ship S@@ anna into the sea .
&quot; born in 16@@ 24 , he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today . &quot;
Greenland is only 150 years old .
&quot; proven floating in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic river , in an hour , it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only if it comes to it , it acceler@@ ates five meters long animal to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and is with this top speed half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , however , seems to be a cartridge concept for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commenting on Alexander Sch@@ ab@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life expectancy , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the Evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist thought a long time that Greenland . &quot;
only lack of evidence .
&quot; Greenland is difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter . &quot;
researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle according to little .
&quot; her time @-@ h@@ amp@@ ou@@ sted them , when they were in front of the S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; prey do this shar@@ ks still : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed the j@@ aw bones of a young polar bears . &quot;
&quot; possibly , they hunt sleep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and search Kad@@ aver , which is from higher water layers after bottom . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen from the North Atlantic coast .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 @-@ centi@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; the eye of the eye is already created before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained in the proteins were not renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; therefore , their birth should be moved to the early 1960s when atomic tests are trying to get bigger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to 220 centi@@ meters in length , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear @-@ arm , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland shar@@ ks had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ metres of Greenland at the age of 335 years , while the Rekord Ha@@ i should even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland &apos;s females can only get young , if they are longer than four meters , it was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to arrange an old age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
the world record is likely to be world record .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland was also caught on Alaska in the neck of 120 years old , was caught on Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism often runs on savings . &quot;
so they mature later - and worse slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; the volume increases much faster than its surface , which leaves the heat heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than at one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as early as many descendants , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist . &quot;
a very big beast should invest his resources rather in a long life .
construction is in double pack
&quot; with topics around the construction , the municipal council is concerned in the latest session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Committee adopted the statement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the youngest residential area can finally begin . &quot;
&quot; after the plot of land , par@@ zel@@ ers and exclusive issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for survey@@ ing were made , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; road l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) to those interested parties have nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the municipal council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in the rural and quiet residential community , Schö@@ nau young families , and ru@@ sty seniors may address equally . &quot;
&quot; as it was called , building permit can be noti@@ fied immediately in the City Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be held in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to include requests to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial establishments , linked to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to re @-@ change the annex@@ ation plan in parts of this year in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ time distribution , the commercial area is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of Main has therefore the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether funds will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for the approval in the UK until now . &quot;
they just use big US banks .
&quot; several banks have already announced , jobs . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lob@@ by@@ ist &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects a total of 10000 new jobs within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , re@@ united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the euro@@ zone &apos;s largest banks , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector less than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Luxembourg insi@@ sted a large fund industry , but it is still worse like Dublin at the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt am significantly easier to achieve . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city with slightly available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the mus@@ sels for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 per cent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt also offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the corporate consulting Mer@@ cer stand the city at No. 7 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European Internal Market , Frankfurt may attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot;
&quot; but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2015 , the power relations work : in London , the Landesbank Hel@@ aba Group worked around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. official judge decided that Gilead &apos;s Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs , which from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead was liberated from a damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines of the Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge had a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts . &quot;

&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to move with Gilead , which govern@@ s the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took each other of the def@@ endants and their property to laboratories in which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r arrested , active ingredients in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; Clin@@ ics worth 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Hillary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 , this revealed for the Presidential candidate of the Democrats and its husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million ended for char@@ itable purposes mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; the former Foreign Minister gave USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ es continue to continue standards in relation to financial transparency , &quot; by Clin@@ ics Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ met@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false expressions and re@@ tra@@ ders to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidate to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his attor@@ neys are provided as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al to control tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s electoral campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN said that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax tests are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already dis@@ able that his ref@@ us@@ al issues related to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business@@ men and various other compounds , particularly with Russia . &quot;
Clinton had already over@@ thrown on the topic and published on Friday a video on the internet in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump stri@@ ve to publish his tax statement .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during an address to the Michigan economy . &quot;

&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO announced that Tr@@ ump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax att@@ ach@@ ers and tax advis@@ ers that would be the case still the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a theme in the electoral struggle .

&quot; con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work ör@@ head support Tanz@@ anias elephant &quot;
&quot; natural Prot@@ ector in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox nature to hold the eleph@@ ants of it , in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already intensi@@ fied the idea for years ago , trained with the U.S. natural protection , trained by volunteers in villages in the north Tanz@@ anian , a violent four @-@ phase method to protect their houses and har@@ vest@@ ing without loss of animals . &quot;
previously many speakers have used to defend itself .
Friday is what is dedicated to the animal protection day .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe their attitude within this municipalities , with much more confidence that they can stop the eleph@@ ants of their fields without damage the elephant . &quot; &quot; the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
&quot; the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch , and the bub@@ bles in a horn . &quot;
&quot; when he is not deported , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with Earth will be packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom which is used to the spark plugs .
&quot; when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom is placed with a button and spray fine dust to Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
&quot; as a rule , a hint of right in order to hunt the elephant . &quot;

Jewish filmmaker disin@@ teg@@ rates Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ folding a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix , since it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ ex@@ document &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country pre@@ ference list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; the country , however , was not listed between countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via an independent call center .
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the answer , which he received there , raised him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel asked that the measure would be a &quot; expected decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason , who was standing behind , dissolved in the director even more fur@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and abbrevi@@ ated from this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has applied in exactly this hotel chain , even greater dis@@ grace . &quot;
no explanation does not need any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the incident dis@@ b@@ anded a fairly large response from the Internet , where people called it a scandal . &quot;
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given the alleged interpretation of Arabic guests .
&quot; ashamed you , called it in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
the hotel quickly rejected all the alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; dec@@ or &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; Israel do not agree to the folder list , &quot; cited the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ant Brazilian students
students will join the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police set Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ers .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to drive the students that led to the police , rubber and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as police officers . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their aspir@@ ation on their plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ors saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provisional President of Michel T@@ emer &apos;s walls .
the youngest protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators came to streets in order to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff caused by a vote of the Senate on its con@@ vocation from the office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teheran rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest on sites of Russian companies grew sharply in the country , shared the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies engage existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign citizen gave around 35,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel route Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record @-@ figures Irish tourists fall in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something , of whom the amb@@ ass@@ adors hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : fung@@ us to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch at St. Anna were travelling on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
four stages were made together .
&quot; in order to over@@ take the time until next Rom@@ ot journey of all ministers in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ cy round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage goals was checked , and we decided to finally decide for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where he was given the opening of mercy on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy in Freiburg on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , Münster . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is made from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor of Stor@@ y@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and divided the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ a , by train at the start of Vill@@ ingen , where a Mu@@ enster age of Münster has been standing , and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was held from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were taken in the morning and evening , each with a short pul@@ pit with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but on the way , the Min@@ is made on field cru@@ ises , chap@@ els or churches and again ra@@ ges to sing together a song from a special pilgrims of pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the local parish church stood at your disposal . &quot;
in the stages Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ ever served as tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast .
on the second day Fur@@ tw@@ angen went to G@@ üt@@ enbach .
&quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : on the other hand , the stage was after St. Peter , which had to beat the most exhau@@ sting road , but had to beat around 500 meters in sw@@ ag@@ gregate heat and then resumed after that . &quot;
the served reward was a dinner at the bad@@ ger in the evening .
&quot; after the morning of the fourth pilgrimage , the impos@@ ing monastery of St. Peter went on the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; clearly facil@@ it@@ ates and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster in the late afternoon . &quot;
God ow@@ es God thanks to a small impulse here .
at the evening mass in Münster the Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ bert Markus O@@ bert .
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the sacri@@ sty and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ ze metropolis .
&quot; in the afternoon , there went down by train to Hor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all participants were involved that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ my home , as Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling . &quot;
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ sts last night in the male team of men in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor part , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he took up the legend , when he stor@@ med up his home to introduce a victory from New York &apos;s New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympics medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after they took place in March by train world championships in London , despite the cancellation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was Jamie Staff &apos;s substitute .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ re a gap which tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man when they stayed when they saw potential in the sc@@ orn that un@@ folds now .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y and S@@ kin@@ ner sat down in the qualification round of the Olympics , but in the stand@@ still won the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des fell short after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and S@@ kin@@ ner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of transformation , in the execution of a higher gear , to slow down , and it Kenn@@ y and especially S@@ kin@@ ner to hold the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC @-@ expert from his position and fell s@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they went on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and to make me a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up a Olympic champion and defeated the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the Triumph of 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there were Hin@@ des that he fell on track after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of England &apos;s rival .
&quot; with such a surprise , this time there was no problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so bad at so many world cap@@ tions , that it was amazing to win back to the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a cash @-@ gauge of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is possible in the realm of the possibility to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) were born and a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the com@@ edy of Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team Event is always best .
one can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts for the day , but there were further good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Brown Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ bs qualified himself with the fastest power in the four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins of security in the focus . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had cont@@ ested the qualification before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height size . &quot;
&quot; the corresponding women &apos;s competition , continued tomorrow and ended , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is leaving his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a donation to medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations were down for Rio . &quot;
&quot; it played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mapping , as well as retired from sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , then the legendary reputation GB@@ S , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
&quot; future of the melting of Portland , due to lifting the energy agreement &quot;
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers , stand on the game since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply and thereby disp@@ ers@@ ed all delivery contracts . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the government in Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies to be commissioned to the plant . &quot;
a maximinum payout is scheduled for 20 years in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 work@@ places in the Al@@ coa facility in Portland stand on the game . &quot;
&quot; no less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it could come to domin@@ ance , as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
&quot; the melt of the Al@@ coa , Portland , loses money and ris@@ ky a closure . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years long spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mel@@ anch@@ ors with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in the Latin Valley , divided that three other owners are going to termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller parts . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melt &quot; &quot; divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L said moreover , that the tre@@ aties of the so @-@ called &quot; safety transactions , &quot; would have to enter into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts concluded a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L will assume that contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on revenues to AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L told that the value of contracts had already been written in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol ... &quot; &quot; to operate the melt &quot; &quot; or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company told that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have been found in force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration , why it has declined from the contract . &quot;
&quot; based on the bad economic circumstances of the industry , analysts were able to melt the potential closing of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consume about 600 MW and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a power generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people who love me , the view of this Co@@ vers &quot; weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) to forget the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an On@@ es and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ orn ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ es and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ orn ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ es and that ends with a classic turn : you have all a surprise @-@ party planned .

&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her , beaten as regards the Vog@@ ue Cover ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most common issue of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , the rather resem@@ bles a fashion magazine than a fashion magazine , the output is a large number of commerci@@ als ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) of the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 615 pp . &quot;
&quot; the revel@@ ing of his co@@ w@@ stars is expected to see that in the last two years , pictures of the journal were still le@@ ak@@ ened from the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already in the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar Lawrence was in 2013 on cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor of the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; passage model &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category is , it is in good company . &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related with famous people related or reality stars or young people from today they know how to open a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is on the denomin@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women to draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like any success each .

&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and the like - in their request for free legal advice and legal laws . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already exploited already , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June , the next year , this legal centres will be losing further 30 percent of their federal government . &quot;
the director of the congreg@@ ational Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell reported that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people were dismissed every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a repe@@ al of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; in Queensland state centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who aband@@ on violent relations , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families who are un@@ just@@ ly released - all these people have problems right way and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help you need . &quot;
&quot; by June 2017 , the federal government will reduce the funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of aid needs to be forced out of Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Culture and the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , to raise these medium cuts immediately , so people get the help they need to obtain legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled their commitment to lift funds on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centers and their customers , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in these important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of European elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and CDU . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys of the Outlook Research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; Newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could rise , this is not possible according to the fra@@ gment values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to set the head of government . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
&quot; according to the survey , the party is still just short of the CDU that could come back to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) and the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
&quot; despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are back into the heavy trainer . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent each day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD delegation received only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 22.@@ 3.4 per cent .
&quot; this makes it even behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be present at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to return , the pirates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; E @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
&quot; the tool weighed nearly half a kilogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 . &quot;
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , which would suff@@ ice to a high resolution today . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 GB .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they are somehow from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the western bottle format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and emails were sent and received , even by fax it was communic@@ ator to the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser , even if tor@@ ily slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen was found .
&quot; the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could be in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has since been different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was eventually sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market prevail , all of which came later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; ever and everywhere , this is now for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphones worldwide . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone account of 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
&quot; the worldwide sales of the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running business of the countless App @-@ providers and the telecommunic@@ ations organization come . &quot;
&quot; around the smartphone , a whole industry has been created . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market first came in early 2007 , then the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; today , Apple began the real product of the Group today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night . &quot;
&quot; they ultimately disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , every German only has 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to move the smartphone even time , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing together .
England must turn to the Olympic spirit and Heathrow
&quot; Heathrow is not just in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of the rows , just as it was in London in 2012 when we benef@@ ited a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad has great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; and that will again be reached by creating new opportunities for local residents , and companies in the vicinity of Heathrow . &quot;
&quot; for our local municipalities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices , create 40,000 new jobs and preparing youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who think the challenge of the enlargement of the Extension is too big . &quot;
I told me that England never will be ready for the games and that we will move on the world stage .
the two fl@@ ashes were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heathrow answers any question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion on wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and in whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heathrow which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from T5 - which was built for five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third drive , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s London Games were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
&quot; it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and Heathrow and create our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England . &quot;

ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ c &quot; on display block &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software package tests , advertis@@ ers block money will earn , according to a software producer , to handle an &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - und Maus@@ spiel . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertis@@ ements on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ o@@ post that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the coding regarding his advertisement in order to detect the indicators that part of the page advertisement is to be difficult . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ o@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams stated that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight is already underway since the invention of advertis@@ ers @-@ loose source community and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left in the struggle for social media , is a strong indi@@ z for the industry , such as wor@@ r@@ ying ad @-@ lock@@ ers for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , we use around 200 million people in the world wide last year ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users active on Facebook via their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ fish is 84 percent of the advertising survey . &quot;
&quot; the company has responded to display block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile advertising block have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , it divided a speaker . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue from that Facebook appears the investment of such stri@@ de as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; &quot; to have more control over the commercial ads . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying because they were also content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , divided a spokes@@ man by Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a m@@ ute tool , so we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in susp@@ ect suicide on Swiss Motor@@ way
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police call witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a susp@@ icious suicide of several vehicles passed on a highway . &quot;
the incident happened at A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 years , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police said these as well as every witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; a investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is an &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; that is something the prosecutor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be taken to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - one person in the dark on the highway ran - was decided that drivers do not have to go out that pede@@ stri@@ ans run in the middle of the night as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman of neg@@ li@@ gible killing , after having crossed a man and killed one night in August 2014 at the A1 , near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk , and it was un@@ conscious in the street . &quot;
&quot; the court determined that the polic@@ eman -- that had answered an emergency call -- that the presence of a man was on the road a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able situation , &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was probably inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
&quot; scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms , which are similar to those of climate @-@ scientists . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere might be er@@ d@@ ited . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be declared through their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , similar atmosphere , and slowly turned on . &quot;
the model lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus have exposed their day of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds which seems like an umbrella to remove the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution which was suspected of plant@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably resident , Venus -- was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
her oceans and their water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; when their hydro@@ gen de@@ ceased , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide is back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today . &quot;
researchers distributed the results of their new Venus Climate Change in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a minor change in decision making the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek immediately after a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I met my duties as Head of Music and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the course of the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he also must have a decisive point in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his team &apos;s contributions . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him for the future only .
Roy for his debut season the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 was the winner of the Jack Adam Awards as the best trainer in the league .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the last two years in the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 season and fell behind the Wild for a second game spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ers take up talks again to put strike out
&quot; the workers &quot; struggle regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended , while all parties will put on the table for a new double @-@ round table . &quot;
strikes against the non @-@ field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea that operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and its trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will hold some full day sessions in the next weeks to start the start of the problems early next year .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against potential wage gains of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut its rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the enterprise has the necessary space to come across the market swing .
&quot; Shell has announced plans for thousands of people and plans to give plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as the result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ credit@@ ation dispute with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower raw oil prices under pressure , an economic situation aimed at the decision of the British in June which had intensi@@ fied the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish member of Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour camps that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many , and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend less than $ 1.4 billion in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler &apos;s rot@@ ational rate of stars in the shooting stars of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; the latest mission with the Kepler pupp@@ y teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates , among the stars of the star@@ base . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the stars are rotating at different rates , as well as related to the rot@@ ational periods with the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experienced by the same of our results with other ob@@ servatory , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ving of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which were originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
you are now fastest on the fastest .
&quot; at top speed rates , these mature stars encounter huge amounts of stars . &quot;
&quot; because these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a brakes to the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is al@@ igned , its rotation rate starts to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable constellation -- as sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; the latest catalogue of rotation rates points out , that more powerful stars are slower than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , where larger stars are turning slower than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ v@@ aden , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to become very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the constellation of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare Stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ation rates . &quot;
&quot; the constellation of the Ple@@ y@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar press in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , when , When and why stars will slow down their rot@@ ations and hang their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of rotation rates of Ple@@ y@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball Star begins
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days of Base Base Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot;
its signature under a tenth year agreement signed him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contra@@ diction on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as consultants and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez back long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Navy ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , there are only two further bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics . &quot;
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old must not be recorded in the glory hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversial , his appearance is outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star called &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have been prohibited in ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was arrested for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect for many years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez back then . &quot;
his farewell @-@ day did not run smoothly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games will still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez was often sitting on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all Rodri@@ guez , who was married to actress Cameron Di@@ az , was speaking with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson along with the actress of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ rival Boston Red SO@@ x . &quot;

&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic of hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d had been detected last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked agent for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S confirmed his expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games in the afternoon of the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 year old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to participate in the prec@@ urs@@ ors of over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; the National Federation take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will accept the judgment with the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news spread over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old thus went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; stated the lightweight athle@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance to act the blood d@@ oping agent EP@@ O . &quot;
Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was suspended provisional . according to B@@ NT , the B test should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow immediately informed himself with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men don &apos;t pull the right battles , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
thus approximately all the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter can not participate in the chronic hom@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation in Rio .
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on in the class of 85 kg . &quot;
&quot; both cont@@ ests are taking , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World association had signed the complete Russian team until an exception for systematic d@@ op@@ ings to the start , also the runner @-@ nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the former clubs in China had also been su@@ ck@@ led between the athl@@ ete in China . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the Podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun stood at the heart of a con@@ frontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping bet@@ ting , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested at the Chinese championships in 2014 , but only had to sit only a three @-@ month sperm . &quot;
data cl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de erotic h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ s@@ om
programm@@ ers of ext@@ ortion malware are currently targeted on targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware ab@@ wehr @-@ specialists in Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed have at least once , partly several victims of attack with ext@@ ortion software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been aiming to achieve a Ran@@ som@@ ite detection . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims were willing to disp@@ atch charges brought by the perpet@@ rators required to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alise their discretion @-@ software according to observations by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company &apos;s network networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially li@@ vel@@ ed ran@@ s@@ om is significantly higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we currently observe a terri@@ fying fast evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the ext@@ ortion software for itself .
&quot; only private users were the goal , but the change@@ over to company attacks took place in the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , they are looking for targeted files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files en@@ codes the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; to get the final de@@ cryp@@ ting code to the files , the victims must have money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ ole Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private use the personal photo database is on the game , it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a Ran@@ som@@ o beats . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to interru@@ pt the business activity in one case . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were already threatened by attacks in which patients can be threatened by the loss of nur@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : is not paying , you will only improve the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 per cent of the companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the ext@@ ortion and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money . &quot;
&quot; you will explain their sacrifices with chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and , private people are redeemed with payments of a few hundred euros , companies may have hard to deal with hard and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to withdraw their data . &quot;
&quot; in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ o er@@ press@@ room , h@@ ack@@ ers will always be a professional and share the work , explains safety @-@ wing Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; it is likely , however , that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their pollut@@ ants then in the form of a software structure to the actual ext@@ ortion .
&quot; the previous malware kits developed by malware self , advice and additional tools for a special , fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery included is a custom@@ ization tool that can be changed smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the press@@ ors are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buying the set of a criminal and contra@@ cted the software to install the software on the many PCs . &quot;
payment is made per in@@ jected machine .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then transfer sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 per cent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ back and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient threat to successful path@@ o@@ edi@@ fication , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the compensation according to type of data is even more than earlier than before . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators will also make a completely new goals in the internet of things on the grain .
&quot; on the h@@ acker conference , Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers , as they could have received with the associated thermo@@ stat on their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the un@@ folding of a der@@ art block could quite be worth a ran@@ s@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators will then block a whole production road in a factory in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life as an extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers both in the first row and in the rear of the rear , there is no place in any position . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and is pleasant , only the cockpit of the inside falls slightly . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; there is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l in high set and 10@@ 26 l in the folded back rests , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bank can be high as the chin @-@ up and offer storage space which is from the floor to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however , the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm of wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , his job should be slightly qui@@ eter . &quot;
gr@@ ati@@ fying is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine curing : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment can be found in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
&quot; one of the safety systems is the city emergency assistant ( works up to pace 32 ) , the coll@@ ision type system and trace elements . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , the coll@@ ision was irrit@@ ated because he assessed many obstacles as &quot; her@@ e@@ zing objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable is the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation assistant .
and the intelligent speed regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t when needed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More . &quot;
&quot; two US@@ B@@ - and HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest , and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve . &quot;
the roughly 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive about 20000 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the motors comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ wing car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Higher Regional Court of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) is conc@@ ei@@ vable only in danger of haz@@ ards , which are typical for air traffic . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee should be broken .
&quot; the accident could however happen everywhere - there is a general risk of living , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
disease case : when paid the promot@@ er
&quot; after their journey , there will only be money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate free to find in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ able case , a family was severely ill for diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vomiting in the second day of its Turkish descent . &quot;
it spent nearly the entire holiday in the room .
their condition brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a faulty plumbing that allegedly poll@@ utes the sea water .
&quot; the family was the view , the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the applicant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er learned only before departure the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no pollution were found .
the disease number of several hotel guests - wom@@ o@@ ily through infection - belong to the general life risk .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 people were ill . &quot;
&quot; after the violent crimes committed in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state had to be possessed and decided to react on terror at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
we will not indul@@ ge this triumph .
&quot; if the off@@ ender have to leave the country qu@@ icker , but raise the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will be able to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag &apos; proposal .
&quot; he also announced another management rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ic@@ ation for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ law is approved so as amended , especially the purchase of weapons in the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the last much discussed silence for doctors , to stay in words after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères . &quot;
&quot; however , in dialogue with the doctors , he wants to search for solutions , as the endanger@@ ing of citizens could be reduced , he said with a look at mental opinions . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care . &quot;
teachers would have to be prepared better in handling of trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
&quot; for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to investig@@ ate the use of foreign investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior is clear against shareholder .
&quot; that was an ear @-@ cerem@@ onies for the hing@@ es in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected a ban on the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality .
a generic prohibition of full di@@ ligence is un@@ problem@@ atic for constitu@@ tionally un@@ problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t offer everything you refuse and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
please speak about rules about road traffic or for witnesses .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the minister before he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terrorist act of energy and action .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ ver@@ bs and a tigh@@ tening of the law bring people no longer safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the highway exit
it is a regular basis on the move road - here &apos;s a picture from November .
but that should change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ction is to be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all the car drivers who are standing in professional traffic on the ambient road every night in the St@@ au highway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road building is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , between the Hammer Road and the Depart@@ eler street to the legal turn of 700 meters . &quot;
drivers then can handle right from the Hammer street right .
&quot; the big advantage : the transport divi@@ des itself early , thereby making the whole section on the multiple section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
driving direction on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying the drivers before between 17 and 19 hrs .
week@@ days from back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler street .
&quot; from here , traffic only will be guided via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be returned to three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations have revealed that the bridge has no longer the necessary load capacity , especially to include heavy traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that linked to an associated program , the competent authority may not say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is expected to be with years : because the bridge has an official remaining duration of up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ur , the state business has deliberately chosen the traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site .
inter@@ cultural tour : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association Nim@@ a &apos;s and the Young Theatre is planning a music project now .
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s organisation enables young people to visit cultural institutions with migration and refugee camps , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a performance of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Young Theater in Münster . &quot;
in the context of the association Nim@@ a &apos;s initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years took the st@@ aging in the little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association has been providing cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee @-@ background to the goal of visiting schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the@@ atri@@ cal images and video animations it would have been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work together as part of a music theatre project in the upcoming season . &quot;
&quot; between October and December , young people with and without a migration and migration background can be obtained between 14 and 20 years , professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language courses are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of increasing refugee numbers , the association with many classes , who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope to improve weather
the weather has the shooting stars in the south @-@ west of Germany at night to Friday a stop by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was very suitable for clouds and rain for me to observe the Himm@@ els@@ spectac@@ le , said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory of Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; at the shooting stars , Persian is the quick@@ est shooting stars that belong to the fastest cat@@ ches with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they are apparently coming from the constellation of Per@@ se@@ us , coming in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you are getting around for ever , at night you wake up hours , in the morning it is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything else as relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleeping troubles and more than ten percent emp@@ ires their sleep frequently or are not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there may cause many causes of causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter Weber , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eving and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; but what you understand in , is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an input and a sleep@@ y distur@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; having just sleep so many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says the board member of the German house@@ keeper association with practice in the Dutch Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
&quot; behind it is organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors , but also drugs . &quot;
the sleep distur@@ bing of another disease is not rare .
&quot; very early wake up is common in depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ alth . &quot;
and it can be that various factors relate to each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lying , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts to sal@@ o@@ ily about everyday problems and worry , gives you an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with sleep problems ?
&quot; who is not sleeping over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , and the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look differently : one is beaten , tired , un@@ slaugh@@ tered , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical problems such as mag@@ en- or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve the distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in case of case and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; there are hardly any sle@@ eper @-@ medi@@ ated sleeping medicine in Germany , emphas@@ izes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ord , Head of Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should first contact sleep problems initially at the dent@@ ist , advis@@ es We@@ ar . &quot;
the problem can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should happen to the sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; for the study in sleep laboratory , medical laboratory , for example , in case of snor@@ ing with breathing , at disease @-@ fatigue or if you don &apos;t find the cause of l@@ apping interfer@@ ing , explains Fi@@ bre . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch break , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; after being shortened , you go into bed to its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a s@@ ungl@@ asses , chest strap and an ant@@ enn@@ as on your finger . &quot;
the camera also features a camera on the ceiling .
how can people get involved in the handle ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of pitches , where you can get for better sleep . &quot;
&quot; We@@ alth counts on : regular sleep and lifting times , not too long in the bed , don &apos;t sleep long in the bed , not watch television to sleep , alcohol and at night don &apos;t begin to watch it , and that &apos;s quite and not eligible . &quot;
what the Jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler is sold to the dis@@ appointing head of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took the first gold for the first time in Doha , and exhibited his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has shel@@ tered the ex @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook . &quot;
&quot; in a country where a Olympics of € 20,000 is awarded and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig 150,000 € should nobody ever wonder about the lack of medals , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; thus , we can not compete with countries who promote very much , and do not look at the subject of d@@ oping , or even do it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set up , &quot; he explained . &quot;
he wanted to launch a com@@ eback he would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
&quot; just like this , you should also keep it with countries . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent checking , WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A can not participate , &quot; calls for the Hamburg choice , which now operates a ice di@@ ele . &quot;
airport : bonds of Bag@@ ani arrested
professional Die@@ be at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; civilian clothes by Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men , aged 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several t@@ ach@@ ers and baggage pil@@ es .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognised a band in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf , which was known by polic@@ emen from the past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since mid @-@ July of this year , and were mostly professional , working and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the Speci@@ alists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove the Die@@ bs , which have jour@@ ne@@ yed specifically to Germany to have four actions . &quot;
&quot; they had caught up a total of 15,000 euros in total . &quot;
&quot; Alt@@ builds , a couple of lenti@@ ls , in between still a rest head head@@ stone : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not affect the first glance , but the police is among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; go to the east from east to west , one comes along playing places , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
the facade of a gray house has someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl , which should also be demolished soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; like the competent real estate agency Friedrich@@ sha@@ in will be preferred , but will be preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents of the rental contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , since the beginning of the year , the police had been pronounced as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , according to the police three weeks ago , the police had three weeks long official statements , closed parts of the road and maintained visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of unknown house@@ owners had the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and building workers went down from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are kept silent . &quot;
primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are in the immediate vicinity of the hood projects .
&quot; le@@ ft@@ ist violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are three children here , especially from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the hood , they share the care of increasing ten@@ ds and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a pine , who wanted to un@@ wanted police protection from v@@ and@@ alism on the left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ en@@ ator and the police open between home @-@ occupied and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional working class neighborhood that also has a lower average risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
&quot; also home @-@ occupied projects and the resulting housing projects are already a long time to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses have been occupied by the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people today , which they were occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and electoral liner of all over the world : with them , people from the GDR &apos;s days and former Haus@@ er occupied their pine . &quot;
this also noticeable in the rented products that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er will be attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it at designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were subjected to color bugs .
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year , so often together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that , not all neighbours may view this as a problem , may be that they are not affected by crime : off@@ ences such as body injury is estimated to be almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of the off@@ ences make non@@ damage , the ten@@ ds to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , un@@ certainty can be no speech . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ ful : people in the 94 are their neighbours who would not have been determined . &quot;
also the famous burning cars will also give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
&quot; for the studied architect architect , her road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , live together on the street and gets more other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore it was also so important that people get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through the history of history of buildings in former building blocks surrounding the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here people live , which are not so well @-@ stressed , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and Dest@@ ru@@ ction , I &apos;m absolutely not gu@@ ei@@ ving . &quot;
but what should one do when someone doesn &apos;t listen to someone ?
&quot; on all sides of fru@@ stration , there is also a fru@@ stration among the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for random@@ ized that are coated with color bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who moves , should be aware of his - just like someone who pul@@ ls in a pub @-@ quarter , can be complain badly about noise . &quot;
&quot; all people only introduced with first names asked , not called to be called by their right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee commissioned
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the response partner in the integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker in front of the site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue support the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else can participate . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le has now being thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , which has a problem , especially a problem . &quot;
so some - less mo@@ cked than rather to the multitude of desire areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
&quot; an administration training with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a delicate wool mil@@ let . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not her central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is around organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent job for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and corporate players are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; for some time , it has been recognised for some time , apartments for the connecting @-@ of @-@ to @-@ the @-@ line areas that have been recognized . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connectivity .
you need to accommodate refugees in their own or rented flats .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations have to carry the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the farm and a job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been specially designed for some time than very difficult .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , you don &apos;t work on private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the housing must be found , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le are agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , school grounds , one @-@ Euro jobs and hel@@ pf@@ ul@@ arity for refugees and migrants who have fallen or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help car@@ master , do non @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; activity , however , does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a cour@@ ageous feeling .
&quot; so it offers offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , jump here management and amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
&quot; it was central that the refugees get the feeling , they are hop@@ ed and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long period of procedure is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain the refugees that it will take time and it makes it sensible to over@@ take time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling he could not work in Ur@@ bach , could not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be integ@@ rating . &quot;
the clear majority were motivated .
&quot; but problem cases are there , but also said customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people , at all nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this would be a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after the youngest precau@@ tions are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer says quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher na@@ ive might call . &quot; a remaining risk could and if they do not exclu@@ de them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensiti@@ zed .
these events are also subject to the refugees .
the fear would have the fear that the attacks took them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would gladly stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and amb@@ ass@@ ort@@ ment will need to look for activities in the region .
&quot; in the background , they always have a new push to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question , the policy is shy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place it hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet , where we would like to go &quot; , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has also utilized more reasonable to integrate existing people . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they have to help them , both women are agree . &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated because there is no easy answers .
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ers for Hel@@ icop@@ ters
the police helicopter took various territories around one hour - un@@ successfully .
two unknown men are for@@ cible on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house .
&quot; the inhabitants surprised the two , and struck the fet@@ ch into the escape . &quot;

&quot; to the exit , the police put several stri@@ kers and a police helicopter . &quot;
the debt was without success .
&quot; possibly , the unknown , indeed , fell close to the apartment or during their flight . &quot;
