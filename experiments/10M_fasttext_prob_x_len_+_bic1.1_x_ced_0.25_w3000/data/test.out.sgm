<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer searched a little variation with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a couple of minutes, the horses remembered her holiday evening, they hunt for the feed in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometre at this tempo, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">He left his family with his family on the layout of the ALRV on a horse. he did not try to play a photo.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first time in Aachen and the CHIO was the first time in Aachen.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports car survived the man from Anhausen in a small Gala with the Golden sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">At awards there is not a lack of sympathetic sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Federal Chancellery, silver bay leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has wasted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th Prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this distinction means very much," says Langer, "for it is not just for sportive successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer promotes the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he went to the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 major sports athletes, the two-fold U.S. mastics won the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springe Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously wonder the hand of all Erhard."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"investing in infrastructure and the trading agreement, TTP will prevent both Clinton and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are, however, in tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">"he, about the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against it, such as the state of economy may harm - with taxes and regulators."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate the economy, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive back regulators, and he is strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the other hand, Clinton says: the State has certain duties to open, he has more advantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes were increased to the rich, it says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost worsened."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Democratic candidate, announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are refused by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump so there could still be partisan discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and the coal transport in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in so far protected areas, oil promotion should also be possible to terminate the Paris Climate Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast to its investment program, Clinton wants to increase renewable energies with its investment program:" a country will create superpower the clean energies and create millions jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - also at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpaziose trade agreement, they don't want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both companies do not want to isolate the United States by international trade, but just better to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid even better. Clinton calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger-tap.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once again he says: the minimum wage must be ralled, then he says he could not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be likely to develop the control policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one hand, Trump, who wants to pay the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critic will hold him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, Clinton, who wants to ask at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="14">"she is the Executive Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social services in Bavaria, and is concerned with the topic of women on the escape."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are committed to torture or death, or because their families will send them as a hopes for Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for women, other reasons for escape:" many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>

<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily developed."</seg>
<seg id="34">There are so many women to say that they do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the living, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not help themselves, there are more accommodations for them, calls for Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether in Munich on the question of a similar project, such as in Munich, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there are not something in accomodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben alone, women are not divided separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press release of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Central French are in some common floors or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of foreign sideways"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish headplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot defend the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a towel, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile worked narroly, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for its restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, spoke repeatedly by his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report about five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved so far as it would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I seemed to indicate the opposite to me, enthusiasm."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's beaming, sustainable boldness showed that Russia's chief of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution: the shooting of a Russian fighter vehicle at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was horrified.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the fact was even bigger, since it was committed by an even boyfriend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the cut-up again becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media held a fierce, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once it appeared, the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the allegations of conducting officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire is clear."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily associated with all friends who he can get after the last month after a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terrorist attacks on Turkey repeated him also shaken.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"in particular, Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"in this way, a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists stay there long, tomatoes for long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious on the West, since its reaction to the attempted power of power was regarded as weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent groove on the snow-empt of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pids to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of government won a bonus for providing a bonus for the attempted coup d" état in Ankara following the attempted coup d "état."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is true for Moscow. self-understandable is that itself a deep-sitting fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glorious palace allowed it in Russia and Turkey, one of how it described me an analyst," "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries who violate themselves from the West and are badly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between these two differences."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sites."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be recording that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference, both President said that they would not once striped out."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey formied it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it where a common denominator may be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member Turkey, it is certainly better that the two heads of heads will speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he made his graduation at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO), and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later became the head of the head of the head office and the head of the head office."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin:" thanks for your trust. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think it is the most important task of the government, to support their activities as a state leader regarding legislation and controls on the implementation of your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that IVANOV had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei IVANOV was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet intelligence service.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody currently knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man who once was once appointed a potential president, wants to lead once the Russian environmental policy - pushed on large skepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, cited on the website of the Kremlin, IVANOV said," "said IVANOV" "it's true that I was asked to put this very complicated position at the beginning of 2012 - one could say almost there for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it emerges, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessibility Service (FSB) he was appointed the KGB, IVANOV was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called IVANOV as one of five people, whom he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that IVANOV could lead to Putin's second term President of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this item was taken by another, close allies, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Putin became prime minister, before he became president of three and a half years later."</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes an "act of action" to the next rating plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first line it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the SPD leader, Christoph Frmann, said:" we are looking forward to the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in the future, 20 percent of all dwellings as a social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the favourable apartments can also be seen in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great forces in the city hall, however, says:" how are you looking for investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such land at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new residential construction program, which will cost millions, will be paid for incentives."</seg>

<seg id="17">"if the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program does not stand alone: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should only be built."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do we compare the loss of some 1,300 inexpensive apartments, which will come out in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, it will be 500 apartments alone."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planer spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased now out of the city."</seg>

<seg id="25">This is possible in the West city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"on a blow, the problem can be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the western city, at the end of the year, there are deadlines."</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could go back to the price binding for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: that's what the owners do not want to build on housing companies.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British rice pushing his Immune System and Würgereflex a serious test - by taking some of the most polluting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his hand on a Euro-loop, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button of a pulling toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaving every object, he used a luminance to show and show us what he will get."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought out some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the rinsular button of a pulling toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely disgusting, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke of doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he ableaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Wright was known for this to test the resistance of his Darms by passing through the world, and did great things as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations up to rinsets of toilets, the task posed its immune system under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a kid I was relatively inworried about what my health is concerned and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughter water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was just righteous in his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was an dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its prostrate showed a luminance of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, Luminometres is fresh-washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to withdraw after their luminometry over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "who shows the bacterial amount of different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is inside it inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company sent Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstormings that ended so that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">You claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing film, added:" let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had instructed some of the things I have relied on him, like the kind of Russian toilet which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things, with which it was easier to put Ian to finish her, and others, with which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a validation of validation recorded in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents of lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent reported that they have to use at least occasionally products that contain any lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="10">"now, the citizens can now return from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides."</seg>

<seg id="15">"as well, the speed limitments were not adhered to the community called the measuring vehicle from Mössing."</seg>

<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" most light decline, "but also, a dream of course is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The local grids along the road are the strongest.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds significant words."</seg>

<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have been reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, government president Jörg Schmidt acted on a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise agreed by the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, they also have the disadvantages that contribute to the restoration."</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some people still works unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some point - at the inequality of Gedulted for example - the question arises: what does this mean to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it does not allow themselves to speak that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees were.</seg>
<seg id="28">"moreover, many people in view of the high refugees have been concerned about safety."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that are deepened to people, once again did not decide in election campaign times."</seg>

<seg id="5">"those who recently bought a record recently, are all preference according to the age between 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely one group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older platters keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a message report on TV, the camera would follow me while I stand in the midst of a busy street in Soho, before I stand, my hands hold and something determinant as:" so let's let us take a further look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's throw a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of SoHos is slowly added to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent seller have been located, there are still a handful fantastic record specialist."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops, and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have ca. 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed by my house), dress the walls of his house."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy boards which he had appeared and again bought items that he sold when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably a bit too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true to those who buy records, rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my Light.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also notices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the discussions that I have led, people usually have pardoned so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to a specific age of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop, such as phonica, to realize that record stores have a soothing community of socks."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took a violation of the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record enthusiasts will be overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of confidential records, of objects, the happy Jugenderinnations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is with me as a collector, so I think there is so many people."</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" flavored a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who have bought a record last month, they haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, whereas 7% of those who own a record, do not own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I flocked through a stack of Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works on sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages), has noted a" trophy "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't own record players but I'd like to buy a radio record, so I'd like to set it to the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicians."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"they are younger people, not older who first get slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"fetch, which has dedicated the sound board almost a whole floor, has an audience audience when I am clean."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts New Year's latest synthesia instead of experimental jazz drills from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversities at the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but brand mental traumata are badly detectable, if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the shop and viewed the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a mannesterbumblebee as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve a lot, so the collecting records are not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer, or to any way, but the beauty of plates is..." "she drives with a loved grower."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"as I give the ticket to brave the jeans hotline, I observe a group of young teenage boys before a father and daughter to think about a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody can see it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"however, considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers can send in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money as others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my researches revealed that the results of YouGov, they let themselves, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebees through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while at the rigid gaze of an uncanny, 30 years old wrong moderator, who rises above the shoulders nothing of middle ages."</seg>

<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with equinths the joy of music describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meeting, senior social contacts can link and maintain."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often, social and family structures often trigger the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also done Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "arrange and arrange for the others to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the one."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, Hackler."</seg>

<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - at 50 sinning people, who sounds there if a sound goes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the appropriate offer, seniors, various possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolins"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Rio de Janeiro's events will feel durable and unavoidable, a shaving time between competition and grips."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as the olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which will protect from the wristwatch to the trimmer to the triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the coffee shop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female of women with dimples, would definitely be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and charity TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even flawless."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not illuminated any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"next to the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: airgun shoot, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make a humble arguments for my particular favoring, let me take the attention on the discreet charm of the trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so many that I had asked, did not know that it is a Olympic port."</seg>
<seg id="14">That could be also regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampolines and had an athlete until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal for London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outer charme, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a little bit enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorously potential - the cartoonous tremor of his never-going astounds - but also the grazie of the gymnasium and divers, the two sports that combines it essentially."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means that much means" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"ascending champion jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, Hgenuine and Saltos) before it landing at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympics, you will be evaluated according to execution, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two hundred athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists will have to go for gold in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go back and down, down and down to the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the television broadcast also another polite destination: the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted dispute is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir even a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I myself have to watch this play as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a breath."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolinsky is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A backward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallt, seemingly heavier than an astronaut, goes down, then slopes down again, then effortlessly."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreaming, elegant raising of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men of the Saturday, likewise at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">"NBC will slip back as part of an afternoon drive on both days from 14.00."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overseen in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objectification of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his back to air rind and new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators call for political changes in Ethiopia to overthrow the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protests were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right now to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months protests against the government, protests against the country and far more territories."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people climbed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot on anti-armed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how safety sleute young people strokes with shocks while they were forced to make a handheld against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now, the head of the UN authority for Human Rights demands a further investigation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and future will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians, in order to combat terror attacks on the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pose in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was all other than an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to the prison or driven into the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and these no other options have to protest, breaks it out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints which cover everything from the ground up to the throws in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following an extensive criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this zag, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are afraid that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced in recent years, could benefit from turbulence and can be armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years is now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, very many Ethiopians had been able to communicate with social media, since cheap smartphones were increasingly used and improved online services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet Proxies to hide where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since branches prospering the amharma, which come from branches of predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and in flat regions."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are entitled to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"according to his death in 2012, Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, became the Ethiopian prime minister until his death in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly posing in it to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special contractors to make opponents and make it unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this basic skill," Mr Abdi said, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively untransparent reasons to take hold of the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south, unlike the Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Uganda."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of protesters protested the government according to the facts alleged by the government and then stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razcia, many protests were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning, like the new Pendlership, as well as its measurable progress in the poverty line."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intention of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, a amharic town, of tigray managed shops and hatred toward the Tigray will always be more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests in the US and other Western allies are put into an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights via the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly intends to support democracy, he doesn't want to support its ally in a volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr Abdi," "is a very thin hike."</seg>

<seg id="11">"sealed man, 54, ordered a fresh squeezer with olive oil while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato purée and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered Hackfry, this couple found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelsberg. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, meat loaf and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from a ingredient and a little cheaper which streaks the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">"imagine, so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner."</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cook for male Feldarers and it was served freshly baked pastete for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who were sent to starving Europeans during the first World War." a Square Meal "shows the paths which the country went on to be no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in which the food for the Americans was a central, rinsed theme," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgeted food: mysterious food such as breads and kitten were used to basic food, the Kasserolle as" wonderful kind, food remains reconfident "," it was mirrored because it could hide unappetizing ingredients amongst a creative sauce. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry obst.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the meat, which was the center of the American kitchen, has been a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"such blends were tried, as a calorie rich and nourishing satisfaction came before taste or even healthy kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>

<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic treat.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports about the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Me-cake-meal posture."</seg>

<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt might have committed the same error, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statuise his stomach with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, this is a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt to emphasize that the White House brought the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial food."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, with food to deal was rejected, once the country came back into the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy focuses on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as science on food."</seg>

<seg id="47">There was the windhurdle case.</seg>
<seg id="48">"after the plates were cleared by Eisenberg's, they stripped and Coe made a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum, the President Roosevelt ate at noon."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick, a modest song to be missed. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"there was no proposed cream, just plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>

<seg id="8">"only if it comes to it, it accelerates five meters long animal to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and is with this top speed half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, however, seems to be a cartridge concept for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the professional journal" Science "in any case of Greenland, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commenting on Alexander Schablein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life expectancy, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the Evolutionary biologist thought a long time that Greenland."</seg>

<seg id="14">"Greenland is difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>

<seg id="18">"prey do this sharks still: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw bones of a young polar bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly, they hunt sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and search Kadaver, which is from higher water layers after bottom."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen from the North Atlantic coast.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502-centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the eye of the eye is already created before the birth of sharks, which contained in the proteins were not renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should be moved to the early 1960s when atomic tests are trying to get bigger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in contrast to 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear-arm, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks had a normal carbon-14 amounts, which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the Carbon-14-watch showed a 493-centimetres of Greenland at the age of 335 years, while the Rekord Hai should even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland's females can only get young, if they are longer than four meters, it was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to arrange an old age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">The world record is likely to be world record.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland was also caught on Alaska in the neck of 120 years old, was caught on Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism often runs on savings."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and worse slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume increases much faster than its surface, which leaves the heat heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than at one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as early as many descendants," explains the evolutionary biologist. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was probably inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">"scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, which are similar to those of climate-scientists."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere might be erdited."</seg>

<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, similar atmosphere, and slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably pointed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected against faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus have exposed their day of the sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds which seems like an umbrella to remove the surface of a large part of the solar heat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data clau: so perfide erotic hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeted on targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware abwehr-specialists in Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed have at least once, partly several victims of attack with extortion software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been aiming to achieve a Ransomite detection."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to dispatch charges brought by the perpetrators required to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their discretion-software according to observations by Malwarebytes to attacks in company's network networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially liveled ransom is significantly higher than in private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently observe a terrifying fast evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the extortion software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the goal, but the changeover to company attacks took place in the past months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, they are looking for targeted files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the extortion."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final decrypting code to the files, the victims must have money - usually in the form of Cryptoole Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private use the personal photo database is on the game, it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off when a Ransomo beats."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt the business activity in one case."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were already threatened by attacks in which patients can be threatened by the loss of nurses."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: is not paying, you will only improve the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 per cent of the companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortion and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you will explain their sacrifices with chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites, or decrypt for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and, private people are redeemed with payments of a few hundred euros, companies may have hard to deal with hard and five-digit sums to withdraw their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomo erpressroom, hackers will always be a professional and share the work, explains safety-wing Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is likely, however, that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software structure to the actual extortion.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits developed by malware self, advice and additional tools for a special, fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery included is a customization tool that can be changed smaller configurations, appearance and branding," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors are looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums on the underground, buying the set of a criminal and contracted the software to install the software on the many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per injected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then transfer spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to defend Ransomware by file back-back and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone has no sufficient threat to successful pathoedification, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the compensation according to type of data is even more than earlier than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will also make a completely new goals in the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">"on the hacker conference, Defcon demonstrated safety researchers, as they could have received with the associated thermostat on their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the unfolding of a derart block could quite be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators will then block a whole production road in a factory in the future, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you are getting around for ever, at night you wake up hours, in the morning it is already far ahead of the wake-up to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything else as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleeping troubles and more than ten percent empires their sleep frequently or are not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there may cause many causes of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weber, board member of the German Society for Sleeving and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but what you understand in, is the Insomnie, so an input and a sleepy disturbing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"having just sleep so many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht says the board member of the German housekeeper association with practice in the Dutch Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it is organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">The sleep disturbing of another disease is not rare.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is common in depression frequently," says Wealth. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors relate to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be poorly lying, wakes every two to three hours and starts to saloily about everyday problems and worry, gives you an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not sleeping over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, and the day is impaired, should go to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look differently: one is beaten, tired, unslaughtered, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical problems such as magen- or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in case of case and at most for two weeks - inquire."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there are hardly any sleeper-mediated sleeping medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fiord, Head of Interdisciplinary Research Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, you should first contact sleep problems initially at the dentist, advises Wear."</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should happen to the sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the study in sleep laboratory, medical laboratory, for example, in case of snoring with breathing, at disease-fatigue or if you don't find the cause of lapping interfering, explains Fibre."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch break," "says Fiord."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after being shortened, you go into bed to its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a sunglasses, chest strap and an antennas on your finger."</seg>

<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, since the beginning of the year, the police had been pronounced as a" no-go zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after 22 June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, according to the police three weeks ago, the police had three weeks long official statements, closed parts of the road and maintained visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of unknown houseowners had the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and building workers went down from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are kept silent."</seg>
<seg id="12">Primary school and kindergartens are in the immediate vicinity of the hood projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who are three children here, especially from the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the hood, they share the care of increasing tends and centrification."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin Innenator and the police open between home-occupied and their neighbours, does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional working class neighborhood that also has a lower average risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">"also home-occupied projects and the resulting housing projects are already a long time to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses have been occupied by the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police officers, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people today, which they were occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become the magnets for tourists and electoral liner of all over the world: with them, people from the GDR's days and former Hauser occupied their pine."</seg>
<seg id="21">This also noticeable in the rented products that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer will be attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes it at designed slices or freshly painted facades that were subjected to color bugs.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year, so often together with the words" left-autonomous violence. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for that, not all neighbours may view this as a problem, may be that they are not affected by crime: offences such as body injury is estimated to be almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the biggest part of the offences make nondamage, the tends to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, uncertainty can be no speech."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weightful: people in the 94 are their neighbours who would not have been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will also give it directly in the Rigaer longer.</seg>

<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"therefore it was also so important that people get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through the history of history of buildings in former building blocks surrounding the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here people live, which are not so well-stressed," she says. "</seg>

<seg id="38">"so it offers offers such as sport, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, jump here management and ambassadors."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it was central that the refugees get the feeling, they are hoped and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long period of procedure is a problem.</seg>

<seg id="54">Many would gladly stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and ambassortment will need to look for activities in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">"in the background, they always have a new push to refugees and migrants to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question, the policy is shy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet, where we would like to go", "Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has also utilized more reasonable to integrate existing people."</seg>
