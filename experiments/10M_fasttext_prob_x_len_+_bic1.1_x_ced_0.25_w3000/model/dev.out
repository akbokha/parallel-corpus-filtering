Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not really friendly .
the leaders wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as over Teheran to talk dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ating measures in the Middle East .
but with the meeting the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ states must go .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious since years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the continuing sett@@ ling of Israel and raises Netanyahu &apos;s lack of peace to the peace process .
&quot; thanks to the deal , which has been wor@@ sen@@ ed by Obama , the relation of the two further deteri@@ orated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu was invited to the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress held a controversial speech given as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama . &quot;
the speech was not spoken to Obama but meeting had refused this time with regard to the election in Israel .
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor he tells his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb declared , with a little sti@@ ve voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; but it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found at the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officers took the ly@@ che of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which had taken place on a white block , I loved Amy and she is the only woman that ever loved me . &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that the Lamb who travelled into two online courses for the delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , instructed 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot dead and killed according to the police , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Library Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ itäts @-@ Emplo@@ ye@@ es have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; he said , that he made the fat@@ eful emergency call sometime later . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : when the police seized him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ turers were forced to hide behind the closed doors , the authorities are still trying to pro@@ claim a picture of what is motivated . &quot;
&quot; details of the details published by the state agencies on both ends of the state , including what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture from a talented , but perhaps difficult teachers . &quot;
students say they were mar@@ ched on lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where she died , said he did not have any history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned in one of his book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both sub@@ merged into the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited both parties . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations related to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised the Lamb , said he appeared too little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told us that he told him to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; first , the Delta State University previously asked for a assessment of health reasons and said that he has any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he only diversi@@ fied two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in employment policy in the University revealed that the promotion , for the Lamb so hard , had made no guarantee for a automatic way to a set as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; he said , Univers@@ itäts @-@ President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knows nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; these are questions , the Lamb is no longer able to answer . &quot;
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his home country on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran still in the entry .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he came to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he began his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants , and instru@@ cting ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la hair@@ ston said , she was 15 and he Lamb was 20 , when they met together by mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool guy , which was a couple of years trying to teach her guitar play . &quot;
he was the s@@ ling at that time .
&quot; all girls get melted away when he was there , &quot; said hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; I killed mine wife , &quot; but there was no documents by a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were left 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos; Ste@@ en said , he never met lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb arrived in Pr@@ ish@@ iss , served as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail in the summer of three years ago . &quot;
later they played one or other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes maintenance @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a faint lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er said that he ended with Lamb and Pr@@ ish@@ iss Night in the night of September 5 , after comm@@ ing his guitar and mouth harp with an angry audience . &quot;
there were no signs that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the rooms and v@@ ats together .
I mean they both had a good sense for joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the Dead Professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized on American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , where he was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , members , students and members of the commune in a candle @-@ light mem@@ oration . &quot;
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vig@@ il whilst the university professor &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
tuition is resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that he called the lamb at his emergency call , but there was no indication of it , that the two had ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set fewer jobs for Christmas time

Michael J. Fox dances through his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a major moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was notably not@@ e@@ worthy for personal reasons .
&quot; we were waiting at the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is beside me empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film k@@ icks off , and it comes to me in mind that I am an em@@ ulated track and a arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;

UN leader says that there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban Ki @-@ moon , Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon , says his reply to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will just wor@@ sen violence and poverty for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and join collabor@@ ative negotiations on the Find of a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly &apos;s meetings to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the att@@ itudes must be in@@ sol@@ vable in the Council and in the Syrian people and the regional powers . &quot;
&quot; ban demanded the five permanent members , in order to demonstrate the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity which they have proven with Iran as a nuclear deal . &quot;
8 res@@ sources list that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to stamp him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to withdraw from the upper r@@ ye in the p@@ olls , it did not work ( still ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder what it meant for the opportunities of nomin@@ ation of real estate ads . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts emphas@@ ize that Rick Per@@ sians &apos;s leadership was handed over to the Rising Star Series in 2011 that no one of whom won only a state in the Nomin@@ ation Process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps through power and begin to run their dollar to overthrow it .
here are some recent circul@@ ations that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary stage :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
&quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot;
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view from Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep themselves in early countries .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ tor GO@@ P would be happy with b@@ ump than candidates .
&quot; in a CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son produces approximately the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite part of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ atures not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely crit@@ ici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of those of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Islamic voters think that real estate Mog@@ ul was the right temper@@ ament for pre@@ sidents , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first national state of the nation , state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he had the personality of a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality in order to effectively implement his position , and almost six of 10 impossible to say that his temper@@ ament was not in the White House , so ABC / post . &quot;
republi@@ can voters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; when they arise their schol@@ ar , Republi@@ can elec@@ tors act Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation , say , following a survey of CNN / OR@@ C from the past week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten of July their money sat on Je@@ b Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P elec@@ tors had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans remembered that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation , compared with only 28 % for the final candidates to Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
but it turns out to be a ple@@ th@@ ora of GO@@ P elec@@ tors from Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts indicate that the split box is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ support is spread more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is sober@@ ing support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before everyone Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ i and Chris Christie 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who kills him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take his 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters that support Tr@@ ump , say that they have taken their voices permanently . &quot;
&quot; it can happen much , of course to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
46 per cent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind is twice the case for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign organised two months ago , immigrants from Mexico were &quot; R@@ eig@@ n , &quot; the Immig@@ ration of Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ s were present in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep remote control of the Republi@@ can party and will damage the revival efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they were using Tr@@ ump when asking questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump happens to do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climbed up to new high@@ s .
&quot; by now , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , cancelled about half of Republi@@ can voters support , especially by their external sub @-@ status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans speak in the new mon@@ day pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa in front of two weeks shows that three out of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hard@@ wood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ king weg you can find the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea island .
&quot; in the street , a square meter floor house cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros . &quot;
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is limited , according to the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows which particular locations will cost a square meter most .
&quot; naturally , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meters for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price comes as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; the real estate agency Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential property , with square prices in dizz@@ ying high@@ s . &quot;
&quot; several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square , remember . &quot;
but good one who can afford it ...
Inci@@ dentally : Munich is not an exception here at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start with Müller and Göt@@ ze
double go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
&quot; a lucky hit by Thomas Müller was on the way to a earned 3 : 0 for the Beijing Olympics , Pi@@ raeus , followed by Thomas Müller . &quot;
a brilliant start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start into the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the wit@@ ch chair of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their tak@@ e@@ play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to Mül@@ lers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Go@@ ose hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth one in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to get to Munich in the third stop . &quot;
&quot; Müller received the Champions League for the Champions League at the Champions League at the Champions League at Bavaria @-@ Tor@@ wart MEP Roberto , who led a shot fired by the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , if Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame had promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , and the Munich celebrated word in Munich . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without g@@ lowing . &quot;
&quot; he won his youngest six games in the royal class , among them for prominent clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ ageous , in her non @-@ intensive efforts , but often lead to works . &quot;
attacks were often led to the left @-@ run of Douglas Costa on the left hand of the left by the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Mu@@ eller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k struck the right half @-@ field on the left of the left .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
&quot; Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski , among the best occasions in the world by Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski . &quot;
initially as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Der Stür@@ mer Crane beat down the line of Poland on the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then , with direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto died with the knee ( 35 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bayern dominated her constant play , Pi@@ raeus could settle con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was on the door@@ ke@@ epers .
&quot; so , as he drew a shot from ide@@ ye on the lan@@ tern ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New he sent Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a neighborhood with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , back in the Kad@@ esh , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , said Sports Group Matthias Sam@@ mer in &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this has already been mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought to King@@ sley Com@@ an for the distant Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; it came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller made another one better . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of b@@ agu@@ ing Bavaria fans in their viewer blo@@ c had evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of the hosts of Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich tra@@ ilers . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ fan were transported from the stadium .
&quot; smoking , has higher risk of loos@@ ing teeth &quot;
&quot; whoever cat@@ ches , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a long @-@ term study near the Potsdam . &quot;
the good news : if ren@@ unci@@ ation decreases the risk of risk .
smokers have a considerably increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking places , there was no risk of losing their teeth at time to 3.6 @-@ 3,6 @-@ F@@ ache . &quot;
scientists had watched over 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes for dental care be cav@@ ities and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth @-@ loss is therefore back to common g@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in smokers back .
&quot; not clari@@ fied whether smoking increases the risk of cav@@ ities .
&quot; people who stopped with smoking , however , could reduce their risk during short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could last for ten years until the endanger@@ ing haz@@ ards came back to the level of non @-@ smoking , first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; we have to convince people to make a non @-@ smoking , study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking minim@@ ized the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and leads according to our knowledge as a good dental health to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of hom@@ el@@ essness is affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking can increase the risk of early dental age .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin@@ point the findings .
archae@@ ologists will find out of Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rema@@ in@@ ders from the late antique
&quot; for once again , archaeological sites have been made on the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; in close proximity to the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ le@@ vard , the Roman @-@ German@@ ischer @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings were excav@@ ated , the museum director Marcus Trier , on Tuesday . &quot;

in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now find five .
&quot; from text documents it had already been known that at the place in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century have had a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remn@@ ants of the fortress and the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms , a cemetery with around 350 graves has been discovered which was probably one of the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system ( TT@@ IP ) concerning the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic@@ ist free trade agreement .
the controversial private open installations for disp@@ utes between corporations and states are intended to be replaced by a more transparent system which corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in its mode .
&quot; we want to set up a system which will trust the citizens &quot; &quot; said S @-@ Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström when presenting itself . &quot;
the Swe@@ din presented a negoti@@ ating position to the US negoti@@ ating position in free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; however , the plans for the reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration Proce@@ dures will be discussed earlier that the EU states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment project . &quot;
they should be derived from the EU , the USA and third countries . &quot;
the second instance is scheduled for the first time .

inspired Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ yan Stev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne prime club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to him , a fli@@ pchart on which the in@@ timi@@ dated Fol@@ ks@@ änger was filmed with the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken away by Stev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; he rel@@ ates from various places that he always draws on the card , written about his min@@ u@@ ously and tender songs . &quot;
where they were created and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , Stev@@ ens points out as a wonder@@ fully creative ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear convin@@ c@@ ably composed songs that can beat harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time being able to drift out . &quot;

&quot; this sixth album album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequ@@ encing or beats and plays with all kinds and hall . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the smaller clubs , the stage shows are shown here to the colorful spectac@@ le of Neon @-@ head@@ bands and a large fluorescent stage . &quot;

&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through a broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one could cause the &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ ns Debut to the Prime Minister &apos;s findings
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ rec@@ ns &apos;s debut is eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour President , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings and put on for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is going to rise to the first of its six pre@@ defined questions shortly after lunch , with his performance tested by the media and the Labour Group . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could safely ski@@ p some meetings to leave their counter@@ parts .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ rec@@ ns lead , as it comes to its appointment as a member of the att@@ endant and to his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party agreed on Tuesday during the celebration of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , giving criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and at the heart of several cover pages in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has paid attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; in respected silence , &quot; and he was recognized by the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of its belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and she is called upon Differ@@ ences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the Foreign Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be fts within Labour , &quot; following Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements toward the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to make Labour changes to remove the entire idea of a limit .
&quot; Mr Smith , the Sha@@ des @-@ Working and R@@ ent ministers , said the party &quot; very clear &quot; is that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour President , with David Cameron since he is T@@ ory boss , who has remained on the dispute over the Disp@@ atch box in the last decade . &quot;
&quot; according to the Labour Party who has promised a different policies , he says &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron and have given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the question of Prime Minister &apos;s prime minister is con@@ front@@ ally , and that it is under@@ going both &quot; impact strength &quot; and the dispute with resistance and that instead of serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela eagle , who is participating in the sha@@ dows of economic ministers , is represented if he particip@@ ates - for example , if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into discussion that other colleagues occasionally the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cy , the spokes@@ man of the house to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told he was to remove himself from the policy of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le The@@ aters &quot; which is often associated with the findings of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; when she was sent to TV in 1990 , the question was sent to prime minister to the prime minister of a driver and leadership in the under@@ house and its position under his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a caric@@ ature and need to require further reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has to be err@@ atic according to data that indicate an increase in wage growth in the UK . parallel to this the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller con@@ current goal .
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period last year . &quot;
this percentage had been the quick@@ est and raised app@@ rais@@ als at the time of a interest @-@ auction since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared with the Euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
&quot; the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index completed an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the best share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was made .
&quot; one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and make brands such as bud@@ get@@ ary , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were similar to the competition for luxury goods by Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % .
judge newest sales figures propose all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reg@@ ained growth .
shares of glomer@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining industry said that it took $ 2.5 billion by a share of stock as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , while Gold@@ man Sachs attracted his assessment for the &quot; &quot; sell @-@ rating &quot; &quot; rating by Sachs . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half year .
chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are dangerous .
&quot; J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill , CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill , says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this purchasing power will be the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could come on expansion plans by J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

Met@@ cash - Com@@ ple@@ tion Com@@ ple@@ tion campaign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
we tried to protect IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ rise from South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ ro launched a ground @-@ consistent campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million dollar .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen your relations with local food suppliers and building the IG@@ A brand through the mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice @-@ manufacturers Fle@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes stores and shop owners , who sell @-@ owned tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be published further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol , and devices will be through its annual Invest@@ ors &apos; strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much on the game , because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop business and make higher profit mar@@ gins as met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; in South Australia and Western Australia , not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland boo@@ sts more than 30 percent in Western Australia as well as 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stanley sat at least five percent of the food market in these two states over twelve months after opening his first markets and will take away all existing dr@@ ills but mainly self @-@ operated retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath appreciated Morgan Stanley is that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 $ millions of sales per year and with cash at $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; after deduc@@ ting the loss of food and gro@@ cers and the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixing cost @-@ base , Met@@ ro could cost approximately $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ ens loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan wrote that IG@@ A purch@@ aser are the most successful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley is taking that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will reduce sales in the food and food market at 3.8 percent in 2016 , increased 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , said at a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ res probably will van@@ ish within one decade . Met@@ ro will van@@ ish . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to react publicly on the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of the met@@ a board member has got in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , IG@@ As market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of food and food trade which is about 1,200 IG@@ A retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in simultaneous printing on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the whol@@ es@@ aler decided , however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to improve sales prices of Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week to improve their growth through faster growing fresh foods and provide better choice of private @-@ label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and charging stations are proposed to Elan , and hopes that major distributors will return in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian National Park , Steve He@@ aly , Australia . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ Kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise to the President of the Australian tennis player . Steve He@@ aly will praise praise to his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is called &quot; Special KS &quot; repeatedly fell into the spot@@ light by the in@@ famous position of C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison will need to be separated by the refer@@ ee , as Harrison had said : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have had to strike C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; at last , as he was seen by a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp w@@ asted one of the potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ Kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ected from He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I con@@ i@@ fer to me is the fact that after my mind , Than@@ asi was a little bit further in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he broke down a ra@@ cket when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player , who has broken off a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration among themselves , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved very good in the US Open even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on and I think he deserves great recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was dealt a bit too hard . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never served a problem with the other players , he trains that he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is well in the form , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os at the important decision that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; shared decision &quot; as the right to everyone , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long lasting element to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the contest and not all the contro@@ versy sur@@ round &#91; C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick succeeded in getting a fast ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he rises in the eyes of the public and he &apos;s trying to support him , we &apos;ll try to keep him appropri@@ ately , and it is best for the team , and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; refugee Crisis : Hungary declared Not@@ standing , closes the Border , continues refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency , and war@@ med the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all that they tried to get illegal to the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials .
&quot; the people who fled on violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations went up .
&quot; as a police helicopter on them was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &apos; Government Open the border ! &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian Prepar@@ ation Police . &quot;
some referred back from protest food and water .
&quot; it said &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al@@ harm .
&quot; it must be held in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a certain meeting in Brussels , where there was no common immigration policy . &quot;
&quot; the ministers , however , agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who fell in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year would have reached an agreement that the EU states would take up another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the migration crisis in the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , won &apos;t put his hopes on air in Brussels or by its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday , provided emergency powers to overcome the crisis in two southern regions , so that they could speed up their streets and could accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said his country also plane the construction of a sp@@ ik@@ wi@@ z@@ a@@ we along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and become a significant point of entry into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; but Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees , entitled to protection - a view that strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high z@@ Za@@ us who revi@@ ve the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws apply to imprisonment for the traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; based on the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency state , &quot; said government speaker Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very distin@@ ctly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but reporter from Associated Press have already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others had been caught up deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across , by damage the fence , they are now in custody , and they are accused of crimes against the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; in the morning , Hungarian officials conducted two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train p@@ act with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke in Hungary in Hungary than the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to handle the data of people and sting a crowd in order to im@@ press it there .
&quot; in about 20 we managed to interv@@ ene , but thousands remain outside . &quot;
&quot; a further group of migrants blocked the main highway connection from Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would give food and water to travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead by Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit in the democratic race around the nomin@@ ation at a national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders prevailed over the ground .
&quot; Clinton had the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced the presidential election , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the presidential election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the local elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ ics Supp@@ orters are in their election as one of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders recorded some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a huge margin in women and temper@@ ate , but these jumps have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support for the men is pl@@ ung@@ ed well , and S@@ anders is located here with only 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ics benefit from democratic election under 50 years has become fully @-@ fle@@ dged , and it and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a huge margin with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit increase in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate in the country &apos;s elections were nation@@ ally saying that they would assist with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reser@@ ving and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps Clinton &apos;s current supporters are impressed by her .
the views are stronger in those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them thr@@ illed .
&quot; while 48 percent of the elec@@ tive voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this on their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ t Supp@@ orters be asked in an open question , why they want the right to be the right experience is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the mind that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
support of Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval for dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president acc@@ uses the potential for the presidential election in the guards , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believe he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the party , who for the party would be their second choice , bi@@ ds is at peak . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ t &apos;s App@@ endi@@ ces , more than half that Bi@@ den would be a second choice far above . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decided not to can@@ di@@ ct for the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton increases by 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race for 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ five percent of democratic voters watch Clinton as a can@@ did@@ acy with the best chances of winning the election , but this number has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that watches him as the &quot; election &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; yet , with the question of what is more important in one candidates , Democratic voters call any questions about the eligi@@ bility . &quot;
similarly as last month no single democr@@ at@@ ric candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential Can@@ didates bring good results with some important tra@@ its in voters for the party &apos;s pre @-@ elections .
&quot; Inter@@ lu@@ tions consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den , as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong management qualities . &quot;
bi@@ den cuts the lead with the three nom@@ inees from hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is hon@@ estly and trusted , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; Democratic voters of the sel@@ ections see in general Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about one quarter of democratic voters have no opinion about S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal E @-@ Mail address and a server , as Secretary of Foreign Affairs , the majority of the Democratic voters were dis@@ satisfied with their statement of the affair and saying that their opinions has not influenced in total . &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most of the Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on their general opinions , although 36 per cent said that their opinion of her wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 , who say their views of Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered tru@@ ely and trusted by the voters of its party , it is still a problem for it under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled voters do not count Tr@@ ump than honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
&quot; however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receives good notes in leadership . &quot;
&quot; of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority does not look rather honest , but as in Car@@ son many do have no opinion about him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters for the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moving forward in a nationwide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is present at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; meanwhile , half of the candidates take part in the new survey , and others loss dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters only supported Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grew 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate in the last month , 27 % on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son f@@ lowed in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well @-@ employed in demo@@ graphic groups and exceeds the Republi@@ can elec@@ torate with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Kas@@ i , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins , Governor Scott Walker , who fell by 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - landing at 19 % support for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
&quot; the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump , notably , Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; with a look at the rising tide in the past week , Tr@@ ump found a number of side@@ walks for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son taught us to question Tr@@ uman &apos;s belief . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign of campaigns in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bath @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; although top values are only measured in the distance , for swimming pools , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough to take warm water . &quot;
&quot; a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short @-@ pleasure , at a maximum of 17 degrees . &quot;
&quot; there is no more entering the sea . at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water has the water in the North and Baltic Sea , divi@@ ding the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; the Mediterranean Sea continues to rise : in the east , it even rises to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood dealing with death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student , while a student of a student club in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; in September 2013 , the members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood can brut@@ ally attacked and delayed their transfer into hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ ck@@ sack full of sand , and repeated attacks while he was trying to join a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , and then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i delta P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood call not the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , &quot; said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the ende@@ av@@ our began to hide and put the good fortune of the Brotherhood in principle , on the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police Officer Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ ilot report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unter strength against head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; to many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student , since 1970 , died of the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer that represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and that step by authorities are very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe suggested a third @-@ degree view for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this will also become ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College was forbidden to the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has resi@@ sted its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
&quot; a interest rate goes , and the fo@@ xes will hit the Wan@@ ke , R@@ end@@ ites for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long will it take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the story for the economy offers low instructions for the process . &quot;
&quot; a recession came in just 11 months after the first rate hike , and it took 86 months . &quot;
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising the interest rates is often , although not always , a factor thereby , as the economy and financial assets react . &quot;
&quot; consequently , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have strongly emphas@@ ised that investors should not concentrate on how they begin to raise the interest rate , but rather on the period in which the norm@@ alization will be needed . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could determine that the whole excitement was possibly excessive due to a interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on a low level , to become a seis@@ mic shock , leading to many . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no consequences . &quot;
&quot; here is a view on historical trends , based on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market seen in the last month , interest rate can take things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is rising , the effect is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seem to be a tendency to diver@@ ts revenue from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a recent study , what happened after interest hon@@ ours of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - around 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days after an current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , CEO and strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares were commercially appear in the Incre@@ ase @-@ cycle and the return on it begins to decrease .
&quot; Rez@@ oning are a fact of economic life , but interest recei@@ vers are often promoting them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts some conditions which could not be able to speed up the recession . &quot;
&quot; highly remarkable is that GDP will be close to its lowest point , at a rate hike of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates stood twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only few expect that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent in the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; interest rate in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky , and t@@ oss the question as if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the whole year made to a interest increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might be an increase in this meeting , the Fut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a Super @-@ cycle with increasing moment@@ um in the GDP and on @-@ recession years put very quickly after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , so the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is an un@@ slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far is 74 months . &quot;
&quot; solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l as the market cap@@ tures a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to it on the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares , if they change its strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the ra@@ int also seem to change direction , once the first increase / decrease in the cycle is carried out . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the enh@@ ancing cycle , the bank fail@@ ures fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in the result of length@@ ening , extended and shorter bonds and lead to a decrease of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high interest rate bonds often bring better yields in such climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; what is interesting , tells Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in the inflation forecast , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prospec@@ t of more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest have increased , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , credit ten@@ derness has expanded , and the vol@@ atility has risen , all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that engage in the larger part of their business activity in the United States , of which interest rates will rise and become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as the dollar increases its products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet increased by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate , in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
&quot; however , companies with high capital management and low vol@@ atility in their shares out@@ performed their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot;
debts will be a major problem .
&quot; the company with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose , said Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity games , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains from higher yields , even when experts in different opinion , how fast will it take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , member of Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the European Parliament &apos;s con@@ serv@@ atives critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster because of his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly recognized by commercial rival .
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , saying that they only limited The Br@@ its . &quot;
parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins &apos;s report to The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that does not do the private . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ serv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; per@@ fi@@ ves &quot; and increasingly not yet to be distinguished by its commercial compet@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dam@@ aging &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he was also looking forward to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which began in the past year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontan@@ e@@ ously known examples in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director showed the accus@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 flies far off his commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to the public at live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music which is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order , I also hold for important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ed that harder it had to be involved as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing of the Committee on Culture , Media and Sports , under fire , came under fire to tr@@ ample the commercial rival . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Collins , The Voice of - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million . &quot;
&quot; see , why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it star@@ red the next time . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exp@@ el the order from the Voice of The Voice in the future or give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August on the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday che@@ ered the issue in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into violin cities . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , experts say that there are now indications that the online revenues are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the expend@@ itu@@ res for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are indications that online sales stag@@ n@@ ates , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has changed in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales charts . &quot;
&quot; it declared that the online sales were more than three years ago , when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes himself and we may experience it reduced growth .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the in@@ let sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases on this event , which will take place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers went out around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some res@@ ale sites cut off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could sl@@ ay the buyer for bar@@ gain , could stop buyers for shopping . &quot;
&quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium , found that £ 5 spending was spending more than £ 1 online . &quot;
&quot; in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases is now done via web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains .
Muslims bury the people in Mec@@ ca during the Crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the bodies of 29 dead , carried out by Muslims at the first insur@@ g@@ ings in Mec@@ ca through the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia det@@ ects the collapse of some of the Saudi @-@ Bin Laden Group to the burden of Saudi @-@ Bin Laden .
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that altogether 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collapsed &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury them that were killed , than a crane collapsed in the Mec@@ ca major mos@@ sy . &quot;
&quot; s@@ wimm@@ ers filled , mostly dressed in white , the way to declare their respect , when the first of the dead arrived her last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ wer@@ m gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went on the Holy War , where only days before a construction ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed collapsed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for funeral , when the Saudi King over the construction company of the Osama bin Laden thanks to the catastrophe which left the 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 residents , which were killed than a crane collapsed by the Great Central Mos@@ ch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , was on his first pilgrimage to the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great mosque .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch towards Mec@@ ca , with thousands who continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group would not have said the arm of the crane should not be used as it was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree pro@@ mul@@ gated by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the Intelligence Service in English speaking this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership will be banned from abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the large mos@@ sy , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims come from the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place in this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
&quot; also because of not recent security , the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ lied the group because it does not co @-@ operated with meteor@@ ologist . &quot;
dozens of cranes sur@@ round Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ cope as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major building projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ ni@@ ger son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated from the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in am@@ id@@ st heavy winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of any healthy and necessary . &quot;
civil servants said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; governmental representatives stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must pay to the members of the killed and the same sum in permanent injuries . &quot;
other injuries will receive half of this amount .

we have to move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; in general , half of our clients come from women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles through women . &quot;
women play a big role in deci@@ ding process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry offered one of the leading companies listed by only five women at the top of a British in F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index in order to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company , which has occupied just 50 percent of the team owned by women , including his Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - variety is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half yearly income and par@@ agra@@ phs after the group had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze the costs for the closing of the shops .
&quot; due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , opens 200 new branches . &quot;
officials of a@@ I / D@@ ob in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to court
&quot; in Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian Volleyball runner , a@@ I / D@@ ob have to have been responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public debt . &quot;
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acquitted in May . &quot;
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , according to the preliminary @-@ prosecutor , had cryst@@ alli@@ zed the funds collected in the years 2006 to 2011 of the agreement that they could serve in their functions , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is covered with around 400,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports functional are also charged for financial conditions .
&quot; this fact divided the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it is to be negotiated at a future date .
&quot; to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence suggested that the association was not a property in any time . &quot;
&quot; the sport function@@ aries have had only allowance for damage and the sports club , for which it had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money for the liabilities - the liabilities were around € 600,000 in the year 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we conduct the club , or un@@ lock ourselves ? , &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ based large @-@ business owner of the financial market . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have deposited money , put our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said during the collection . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , no debts can be made . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the appropriate financial crisis , the payout on the change@@ over damages caused by the end of 1991 had been resolved . &quot;
&quot; so a part of the allowance for damages was completed only years later , from 2003 when an increase was on the account . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Pau@@ ls and the former ob@@ servers also seemed to explain the occurr@@ ence . &quot;
the accounts and savings administered the two def@@ endants in common with the second def@@ endants .
why the out@@ flow to the association were not published in detail then the judge asked .
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for the financial affairs , important to only the debt of debt , such as the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , when investig@@ ating a criminal investigation began in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club account . &quot;
&quot; the accused were , the def@@ endants . &quot;
this value @-@ account refers to the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot;
this did not know how long answered .
&quot; finally , he thought that he was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have knew something of this money , the prosecutor asked the room . &quot;
the accused was informed of inform@@ ing the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; damages &quot; .
why do pollut@@ ants mean ? they want to know judge and public prosecutor .
&quot; the first accused , argu@@ ed that he had not agree with this formulation , since the association never had a damage . &quot;
but what can I do if the lawyer says : &quot; you are all out of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a manager ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the function of the function said he has never referred to a cent salary , he counted o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets he charged € 1,000 a month to the di@@ ets , but the actual effort would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not refer to the accused .
&quot; according to an operating test , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer been laid , declared it . &quot;
the second accused also had o@@ ed Kilomet@@ ers .
&quot; all Beh@@ eb@@ ations are made in cash , with that he has to travel from his residence international market to the Bank in Abi@@ d@@ burg , stated in his testimony . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued by the hearing of witnesses on 23 September .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard handles more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the increased number of personnel by three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese becomes further expanding further jobs in the development of the company . &quot;
the alignment positions at the U.S. Compu@@ terri@@ esen Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) has no end .
&quot; as part of its re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation , the US technology group is planning to dismant@@ ling the dismant@@ ling of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate fin@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; this means that the costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , divided by the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has been ongoing since the last three years , is not yet complete . &quot;
&quot; as at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had approximately 30,000 employees . &quot;
publicly tra@@ ded by the Hew@@ lett Packard @-@ share 2.3 per cent .
&quot; based on Califor@@ ni@@ an Palo Alto , Palo Alto is based on this way : the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led this year in a new company - separately from the preferred areas of computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts shall be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ appointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services deployed the world &apos;s second largest PC producer to Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of financial year , sales of PC and printers went back by 11.5 per cent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to close to US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus the revenue was back in 15 of 16 quarters .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violent crimes in Serbian Border
&quot; the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , as well as water authorities against several hundred retired refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced violent crimes at the border controls .
he reported about :
a group of refugees forced the border .
behind it a polic@@ eman drawn line and behind the polic@@ emen was ready to take a water cann@@ on .
&quot; 40 to 50 fug@@ iti@@ ves started to take stones , sho@@ cks and plastic bottles after the officials . &quot;
the officers initially set free pep@@ per@@ ing pep@@ per@@ es .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was contra@@ cted in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now dismissed a little while now .
a sul@@ try and obviously injured lady was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children who had met the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried . &quot;

&quot; time of decision on interest rates for U.S. banknotes , &quot;
&quot; the world is observed , when the U.S. banknotes come on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists , that were questioned by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view , was that the F@@ ed will not wait longer , and the interest rates remain at the present level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historic event because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed earned interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ enter@@ tain , Head of Staff to the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively high level of performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw material on global conditions .
&quot; she has warned the markets to increase , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is expected to be announced by 8@@ pm CET on Thursday .
death cover at Delta State University left un@@ pre@@ school
&quot; after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague , Sh@@ annon Lamb introduced a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; for the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it dry , &quot; &quot; authorities known on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Assistant for Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences , at the delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and when he had shot down , he was shot down , and one killed . &quot;
&quot; in the emergency , the staff of emergency calls said that police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was in the house , but he could not distur@@ b , but rather excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot;
&quot; lamb was given no explanation for his shots . &quot;
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note of lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to do it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing a note , 300 miles to Delta State University , he stab@@ bed 300 miles to Delta State University , killing E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing , before he finally took his life on Monday nights as police officers . &quot;
&quot; he said , Univers@@ itäts @-@ President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knows nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss already had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been given by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they had been married about seven years ago as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had one daughter , the 19 being , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss . &quot;
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss already had a dog named Light@@ ning that met for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; Lamb called relatives to a certain date on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; taking him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later , arriving in this night , Lamb sent his car to the site , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

Euro@@ swing : Lufthansa encour@@ ages the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group building .
&quot; in 2012 , the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros in a better organization . &quot;
the global workforce will cost around 1000 executives around the world .
&quot; with the pilot project , there are no new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its business structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap wings for Euro@@ s@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the new ignment is an income of some 500 million euros per year from cost and sol@@ uble sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no board for passenger transportation with Lufthansa . &quot;
the cheap company Euro@@ swing should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the Executive Board of Chef Carsten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Yar@@ ns will be responsible for Euro@@ swing . &quot;
&quot; with the re@@ opening , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ swing , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 &quot; 000 associates was complex . &quot;
the airlines tested under the roof of the passage of the Air@@ line Group representing three quarters of annual revenues of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilot
the rate of pil@@ ates with the pilot project cockpit ( VC ) will once again be resumed after the court @-@ held strike on this Thursday .
this distributed the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement control for pilots .

the conflict between the union and the airline led to several strikes in the past months .
background is adjacent to the trans@@ itional provision of the pilots the Spar@@ concept &quot; Wings . &quot;

hat@@ ch Shaw by Manchester United can not play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Shaw dis@@ qualified for the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven with double fra@@ cture of his right bank .
&quot; while this player &apos;s left def@@ ender brought to the left and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Shaw is able to play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a hop@@ eless attack of H@@ é@@ cle Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated on the playing field for nine minutes before being put into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fl@@ ask and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then this is happening . &quot;
in the dressing cabin he had an oxygen mas@@ ke .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , it will take the six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the hanging of a el@@ meter . &quot;
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbit@@ rators had s@@ cour@@ ged .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a penalty of el@@ meter and a red card was due . &quot;
it &apos; been a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account asked : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I bin , my path to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
concerning this : Manchester United gained the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the European Championships in France has an extra inc@@ entive to recover up to the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V co@@ aches , said : &quot; it is a very griev@@ ous injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this type of injury left the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a quar@@ ry when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ i Holland team during the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he does very hard , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the enemy , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno told me : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ty by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely . &quot;
&quot; dear David Cameron , you might be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , born in 1971 , chose Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; there was a difficult choice , Cameron speaking in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my kids , as it seems to have missed an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent section , in which Cameron compos@@ es the action of book , instead re@@ produces an ingredient of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ urg@@ y Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a merchandise , a boy named Ted , who was to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , fulfilled the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , fulfilled the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose name was Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ ages , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that was not suspected enough : the text of Cameron has been broad@@ cast@@ ed on the website of the Lor@@ ax film , which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a merchandise , a boy named Ted , who won the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he admit that a prag@@ matic father seems to be so little familiar , he does not seem to susp@@ end the action of the book so little . here stops an un@@ named young , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy of Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ wling , snor@@ k@@ ingly rich creature that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ pers who has not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Do@@ wning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text may probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons .
&quot; super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons had been delivered , but there was no other direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was threatened with the exclusion from England , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; turning to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ res who selected England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test runs is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s website may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ in players in Batt@@ ing @-@ position , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not wear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this information related to Adam Ly@@ th from the England test cad@@ re and was replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , to analyse hard . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that thr@@ ill players are ge@@ ared to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nomin@@ ation , there - and I said this - players have their own best choice . &quot;
&quot; long ago , it would have been extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; if he points out more of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss blessed his position , even if he had not given such good achievements , and he surprises me not ; he is primarily a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test schl@@ mann receives in order to set his mark , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine received .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to go home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that could be lifted was that England first got Jonathan heb@@ re@@ w in the Caribbean - as ly@@ sine was in peak , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a striking man . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor u@@ ck@@ et@@ player what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he scored 236 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge - what met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances like those before him , but this depends of course on the club application in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of suggest@@ ing Mo@@ een besides Cook , what an extra spin @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler would pick up and pick four ch@@ icks , di@@ ved , and I didn &apos;t know anything about it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there and this left @-@ handed have already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and looked not looking back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ es@@ as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people probably see his statistics - on the average 31 with the stick and 35 with the ball - and think it is a point , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inner that raise their hands and the trainer have opted for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ st , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ le of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes into the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the International Cri@@ cket contest , as a player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela has made int@@ entions from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing cabin , even though the messages are in line with the previously announced . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys Team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break for Australia and I have no problem with that . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team actors won &apos;t determine the schedule . &quot;
and you have to think that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
those decisions cannot be taken from their own heart .

&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , looking for an outside Britain in the interior of the EU @-@ Zel@@ ena - &quot; Leave us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ looking ministers and officials from some capit@@ als have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks great for it as it happened in the exagger@@ ating long rides such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a desper@@ ate force .
Poland almost soon have nation@@ alistic government in Spain .
&quot; it falls hard to imagine that they are getting out a leg in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy is better to prevent the Scottish Australian exit from the UK - something which they do not want , because most of the al@@ chem@@ ist ten@@ dencies did . &quot;
&quot; as a result , some such ministers possibly do not planning some helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , completely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while the referendum to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process in 2017 , probably says my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of a new negoti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how r@@ end@@ ously the fle@@ ets Street can be at its expense , and which EU sk@@ ep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as they did not support our entry in 1973 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you may remember a weak call to Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; ore @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists &quot; &quot; who did a name than an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Straight @-@ Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; in all its enti@@ re@@ ty , Ed Mili@@ band knew that who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ car@@ ing @-@ ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and the P@@ seudo Non @-@ In@@ struction , belonged to most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; as actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but noted that if one sits with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air even when he was opposed to Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Bl@@ air was rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which then was rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; the press never passed him , too . &quot;
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps in the Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to pay for me - seems in danger , Neil Mac@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ cott Mur@@ doch . &quot;
&quot; it may take time , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media but not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee has left he on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position is available in Europe - I &apos;ll press it out - in development .
he says we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional bl@@ ot@@ r@@ ds tendency and wild ge@@ dit@@ ds by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can also say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n , on Radio and TV this week , didn &apos;t have to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea of the prov@@ oking of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler had a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father sat on television , loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet Director , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ &apos;s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fel@@ low@@ disciples and members after all reports on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touch@@ ous bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to tell you that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of television around the clock , and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe who allowed him to hold lab@@ ours in his speech campaign for granted , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins are sure about that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic surplus @-@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economics and their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion in the left dis@@ sidents for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ os@@ us of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ lows are convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign at the exit , to try to find foreign diplom@@ ats , in particular , to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be po@@ int@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US are already fairly dis@@ appointing from the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what is reminis@@ cent of the starting on Monday of something that was called British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health Reg@@ ions of E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) rejected the Lanc@@ et by crit@@ ici@@ zing the public health of England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive verification of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the load capacity of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month grab@@ bed the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny foundation &quot; at the point of which he established his most important conclusion .
two further researchers write to BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European Public Affairs at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public estimate is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; in a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria evaluation ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to bring their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were presented in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health was an independent study before the British American Tob@@ acco Monetary Fund ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants responded to the meeting said funds from an E @-@ cigarettes vendor , but not the financing that he should have received according to reports from tobacco companies Philip Morris International to add them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which include a number of industries financing . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco was part of P@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the Group &quot; ad@@ mits that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
however there will be no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there has been no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes have been as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking .
&quot; every second smo@@ ker , dying from his ad@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared with , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the unique obligation to open the public information on what the evidence shows , and what &apos;s not , especially if there are much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80,000 people die annually at a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health System cost two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear advance of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but just have a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we meet our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should leave East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC should stop using programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival might give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
&quot; he publicly crit@@ ici@@ zed the BBC to make public legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller crowd , in hard controversial time window , against the most popular shows of their rival , and from sen@@ ators as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ Director General , Tony Hall , said the company would have done more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to come in touch with Channel 4 for six years with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs on behalf may or sends , which would also clearly be shown clearly by not subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said the Upper House Communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the round@@ roll fee , which I do not wish to keep medium or long @-@ term idea , you should at least be able to make his production at least on programs that do not do or commission . &quot;
you send The Voice to a first time window because they want to achieve a broad support for the future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ent tax programs fin@@ ances that could be subsidi@@ zed without subsidi@@ zation .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own production . &quot;
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how public @-@ public television is to be .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC to blame for reviews was &quot; because of amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the broad@@ est broad@@ casts of the BBC will be giving the new Director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders meant to sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal commercial @-@ programs &quot; &quot; to be taken at the BB@@ C4 , but they can &apos;t measure up the audience , but they can argue that if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs for justi@@ fication of 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , obviously , we have seen all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window of time in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broadcast charge , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more rainy system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , we all think that one receives 150 £ a year here &apos;s worth a great value , but for people who &apos;s for the 150 £ a lot of money , wonder if that is right , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC asked for a mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , just a little of the BBC production would be officially classified as a formation now - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be informed about the publicly @-@ supported TV broad@@ casts in Australia and Canada , in &quot; inform@@ ing , clear and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to question the partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should have done more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and in the commercial channel of alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos; Son@@ ne@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells by waves of sound waves
&quot; the video shows , like the Nem@@ ato@@ des will change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with impul@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; scientists have bred worms in genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by pul@@ ses of waves . &quot;
&quot; these tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have with sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing , ir@@ radi@@ ated . &quot;
impul@@ ses work by switching on mot@@ ions @-@ on @-@ cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asound .
more about this topic : reading and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said , the Wor@@ mer showed the power of a new trial , called Son@@ ne@@ e@@ Genetics , where ultr@@ asound can be used to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the depths of brain cancer that gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of people used to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ul@@ lab@@ ors don &apos;t react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani felt that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fiers are used on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the waves are generated by opening of these I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als and enable the cells to them to them , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound tech n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions are TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to ultr@@ asound on the changing creatures , the sound waves are strengthened through the micro bub@@ bles and commit to worms , where they change the modified motor @-@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool which allows researchers to detect neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ep@@ etics could have some advantages compared to that technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that must be sent down on a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic tissues could pass so un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible , the targeted human neur@@ ons are temporarily applied to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells added .

eight Gold rules for Life in student halls
&quot; eleven years ago , I walked as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old student in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the an@@ arch@@ ed smile of those who I have sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long @-@ known symptoms over others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
&quot; the entrance into student halls ranges from easily irrit@@ ated , easily sho@@ ck@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to s@@ add@@ les : people tell where you come from , where you have taken part in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n , where you love &apos;s Sabbath year , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just an yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe out through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to figure out people who would like to speak in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were made in fire , and these extingu@@ ishers will be . &quot;
let people do it .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film @-@ night venues and municipal fin@@ ances , but they are also the places where people wear and draw their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this point : do not remember to start the Uni with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ es receives a rough handling at the university .
&quot; her room should be a refuge , but many student residence are a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ w@@ ading culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture is allowed to tell you : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship go on , but you must go away to get the energy back I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow recru@@ it is exhausted from soci@@ ability - and send him an SMS instead .
ap@@ rop@@ os ank@@ let : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the not@@ ion that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with B@@ aking .
&quot; as you begin the Uni on the peak of the back @-@ mania , the clo@@ ak is on the doors of people to present itself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ 16 years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got to you anything . so , and now please smile once you have some personal questions . &quot;
Home @-@ made treats are a good way to close friends .
&quot; their ro@@ omm@@ ates will feel sick to enter@@ tain themselves , and will eventually associate your face with a lovely surprise . &quot;
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; po@@ or@@ ly mi@@ xes from flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you are ank@@ le . &quot;
ste@@ aling foods is a consistent crime in a student residence .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aw of chicken is a theft , but it &apos;s the take of a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ? &quot;
check it with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to themselves yourself , even if they cook in inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it is annoying , and you have emp@@ athy - but try to be balanced than my co @-@ employed who added to their milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise when people keep away from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being an inner man , but that you belong to men in the true sense of the prover@@ b . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if it was a little qui@@ eter , Drum &amp; bass had a little qui@@ eter down , since it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an inspection in the morning . &quot;
they acted on that with even more loud music .
&quot; finally , when they heard about 5 AM , her neighbours came up to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut off her door and ended up at her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it be not romantic if your future wife would coinci@@ de into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; the conver@@ sely , it would not be embar@@ rass@@ ing , if you have a co @-@ hab@@ itable for your future wife partner to take care of them and they will see each day and may experience , as they with@@ draws together all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot person who is definitely not your future wife partner , try at least to talk a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its keys in his un@@ sealed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing , than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stretch is fun , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fall into any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
&quot; close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water which will then place in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers don &apos;t lift up your property on the ceiling twice more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , general @-@ reaching , Ger@@ sho@@ den@@ ers &quot;

&quot; so for Refu@@ ge@@ es - as well as signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the cum@@ ulative mother and the Ger@@ ing @-@ Ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are p@@ ushing the housing markets .
&quot; the owner , Markus Gil@@ dner , knows how quickly the living room could be established : he builds for refugees in a project of town@@ houses . &quot;
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , a lot of refugees to be ens@@ n@@ ared towards the H@@ ousing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : no sustainability in its container or turn@@ out accommodation .
for people staying in a big part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space for decades . &quot;
a whole ban@@ al and three @-@ storey house store is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : the least space .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
this is different if people sub@@ strate the people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of the four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
the houses can easily be converted to individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , excluding any property . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took for six months .
this is reasonable .
do the construction regulations complicated your plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I tried to drive my project right away .
it is particularly complicated to make the imp@@ ending women &apos;s imp@@ ati@@ c@@ ely special construction and parking spaces .
a cre@@ epy .
&quot; it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities the space is missing .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents adapt to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury passenger for asylum seek@@ ers .
this is definitely not right .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the Ri@@ dd@@ lers for Aff@@ ordable apartments ?
&quot; it is true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but luxury apartments were built in the last five years . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother of the Ger@@ sho@@ res alone . &quot;
I show how to build and build well today .
this is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS version when Apple released update
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by calling for setting @-@ up application , in &quot; General &quot; type and then &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it . &quot;
&quot; after the installation , some problems are pushed out because they get an error message inform@@ s that the &quot; software upgrade &quot; is missing . &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush return or try to update via iTunes . &quot;

&quot; of his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators followed the group with a car of up to their home and drove there several times .
&quot; when we saw the car no longer , the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; from the ra@@ cket and another male person , he was once again attacked . &quot;
&quot; under the help of a be@@ zz@@ ling , you applied to the face and the upper th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured one had to be brought to a hospital .

Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ lian and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand .
&quot; also Sam@@ ba &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hen@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; doctors - As@@ endorf , missing in many places in the country , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller will take over practice on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while she is reti@@ ring in the early months , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will go into retirement in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 , he invested 3@@ 10000 euros to the premises on St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; sympath@@ y was sympath@@ y at the first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife managed to know Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ lian who , at the moment , had completed her training course in the hospital and also wants to get involved in practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mül@@ lers would fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low , and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was far , I just called them . &quot;
&quot; in the couple of Mu@@ eller , the idea was in the future of running his own practice in A@@ endorf . &quot;
&quot; the vicinity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know the families of the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one was agree , the Mül@@ lers bought the house with practice . &quot;
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen - Vil@@ sen .
&quot; in Hanover , Frank Müller &apos;s two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up his medical studies in Hanover in several physician offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ singing , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ zel . &quot;

&quot; the Mül@@ lers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as recep@@ tion@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ lian . &quot;
&quot; after conversion , the rooms are displayed modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examination as well as long @-@ term - and load @-@ ups and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 Euro get a total of 50,000 Euros as part of a funding programme taken by the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; st@@ resses Zambia numbers Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ lian , every quarter in the practice of Fel@@ ç@@ ausen , in the North German tourist practice there are approximately 500 . &quot;
there is another house practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ li@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor had been found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; if you visit Mül@@ lers couple , see the question above all in confi@@ dential faces : over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power takes over the wheel . &quot;
&quot; their farewell ended in As@@ endorf , where the doctors had pract@@ ised for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; remembers Ur@@ sel Fel@@ li@@ ausen . &quot;
that &apos;s a bit of sad@@ ness after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to dwell in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , and will often see many patients often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband compl@@ ained : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have pressed myself before pr@@ er@@ work and now it could be otherwise . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; let &apos;s let the refugees go through
&quot; the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; the Minister of Internal Affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , said . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; however , it is clear that anyone who wants an asylum application to do this also &quot; naturally . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but it is clear also that it takes significant signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept infinite migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled way .
Croatia consider &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government previously reported that Slovenia would also continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and can also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the fron@@ tier - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , however , is already heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slo@@ veni@@ ans wants to have its borders to refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill his comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government had abandoned , the first refugees had already tried to travel in the night of the night in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , in order to avoid the registration . &quot;
in the Croatian police she could interv@@ ene in the nearby maize fields .
&quot; according to local media has since meet in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police stations with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; many of them work for Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even life services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; over the coming days , his country had around 4000 refugees , the interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot;
&quot; additionally , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would have brought to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border which have been brought to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , and reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade did , however , that it is necessary to propose a certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; it said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus had arrived in the early morning with some 50 refugees in the town of S@@ id . during the day , more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the passengers were on the road all night , which had been driving around 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary had formed , so the police told us that we should go there , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it could actually have been fore@@ seen by ob@@ servers of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a further west @-@ west track . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; in Croatia , the home of Croatia O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country prepared for the fall of a strong state of electricity by refugees for possible exceptional events . &quot;
he did not look like he pointed out to Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities to border control . &quot;
you bring a tight controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , and since 2007 , Slovenia has been a good report to the country , affecting the standard controls imposed by the border controls . &quot;
&quot; at Serbian border , about 300 refugees continue to be arrested on Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; according to the reports of media reports , they had spent past night in the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border checks of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves now want to travel to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried on Wednesday early at a local spot in horror , nor calm down the debates on Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not be a very high refugee deal .
&quot; could not say if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ mets migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute land cards to refugees , on which altern@@ ate routes by Croatia are ind@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still not yet spacious min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ef@@ ers were sent to the border region . &quot;
stock chi@@ pper : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million
&quot; Su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime claims , accused of having lost more insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites like Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; with the designated information , insi@@ der stores are supposed to have been made in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; this way , the engineers paid a total of over 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately caught , it says in the SEC @-@ Noti@@ fication . &quot;
the process against 32 further char@@ ul@@ ators in the event continued .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators must have ag@@ itated in both the US and Eastern Europe .
&quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals Mannheim consists of 20 years , &quot;

&quot; about life , therefore , we are with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; said Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the spokes@@ woman of the ec@@ umen@@ ical mission is as well as questions and discussions at your disposal as the volunteer workers .
&quot; during man@@ ch a pass spontan@@ e@@ ously sets up a chal@@ k and set the set for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; to stop the war , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , remaining , say , how far I am not yet &quot; and then go further . &quot;
&quot; again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions on the action , we develop , about life , dealing with the die . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .

therefore this more efficient action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
&quot; it is understand@@ able that each on the tablets were un@@ understand@@ able , however , it was understand@@ able , in order to do a very personal cause . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death may be lik@@ ened to Tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , as well as the Hospit@@ ality movement in recent years has helped much to open the people . &quot;
an app@@ rais@@ al that Angel@@ ika Go@@ is shared .
the mort@@ al and funeral prayer is one of the honorary employees of the first hour .
&quot; when confron@@ ted by personal experience with the theme , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in practice . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ian Hospit@@ all@@ ers sought a volunteer by calling , she was immediately reported to have been with it in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ dd@@ ular belongs to a team of 45 honorary positions - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent . &quot;
they all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ lem@@ agne can work well with their task and to deal with experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another point of war@@ eness , and keep it for precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient er@@ per Hosp@@ ital@@ dienst is free of charge and denomin@@ ational .

&quot; the signs described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1a ) and the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there can be further personal desires on postcards , too . &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex @-@ outcome mixed , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer Gig@@ ant puts his winning view over a year due to the weaker demand for freight service and higher costs in his boat service . &quot;
the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers on vacation .
&quot; at this point last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share was over 2.5 per cent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening session .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than with the previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower prospec@@ t comes despite the price increases , aver@@ aging 4.9 percent , and will be effective on January 4 , despite the higher sur@@ charges for soil transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it was expected , compared to the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith told that the company achieves a solid result , considering the weaker economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than the rival @-@ up UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 @-@ 9@@ 5,000 extra labour , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million sold as much as 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve of T@@ acks Investment Research said analysts predicted . &quot;
its sales increased 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
&quot; six out of T@@ acks , analysts asked to expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , Fed@@ Ex has showed a decline in international priority order to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in his unit express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results in Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the past quarter sales revenues increased by 29 percent , but operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher income for higher prices , whereas the result for higher labor costs in the cargo sector decreased . &quot;
&quot; for the pre@@ market trade , an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they completed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ ches spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it is time for the first time to lift the Leit@@ z for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatened above all , there is a mur@@ al of the United States in the end of the disabled , two @-@ story seats . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and her colleagues should put on the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order to date : maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the major recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the immediate short @-@ term interest rate by the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data from the economy show that they grow solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets may increase this vol@@ atility by the lifting of the interest rate for federal government - and it is also just around one @-@ quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; apparently the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief of law at the Mak@@ ing company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , higher in@@ security is around the global market enough justi@@ fication , continue to wait &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is going to do with itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists that were recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted a hike this week .
&quot; the financial markets however expect a must @-@ see the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator , which only shows a 30 % chance to increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the equity market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists are killing the blow by providing a further increase far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial returns showed an average of 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1,4 % to 16,@@ 6@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy told the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , so that they are not in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a interest increase would calm down the financial markets , because they are the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; before a month , the F@@ ed appeared in a good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow con@@ formation of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen were said that in this year , despite the importance of liber@@ als , more economic growth would be necessary to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation in August was slow@@ ed , the improvement on the job market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years , and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full worker . &quot;
wage differentiation had signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation remained constant under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , F@@ ed representatives showed that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension in the job market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ rich . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of the last month after China had used its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial returns reported in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would become global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month the market re@@ covers something , with which the Dow Jones is about 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculation , when you should increase the interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and an ex @-@ employee of the US @-@ based bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he predi@@ ct that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty in what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main areas of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authorities have become the world .
the influence of the central bank was imm@@ en@@ sely in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could restri@@ ct their mon@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; could &quot; &quot; cast the confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , by the F@@ ed representatives , it can not only monitor the developments in another position , but also discuss another central banks and experts in order to maintain a better understanding for global economy . &quot;
&quot; the decision of decision is &quot; more art than science , &quot; he said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has linked a story of re@@ actions on the financial market movement , which apparently doesn &apos;t appear with the economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , decided for a interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their lead to a 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite lim@@ iting effects on growth in the USA , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives representing these cuts .
&quot; F@@ ed ought to put aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis as the market crash of 2008 at the first place , said Adam S. Poznań , on a former member of the Committee on interest in the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the youngest turbul@@ ence come near this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to run into the situation in which she is afraid of interest , because the markets themselves are excited , &quot; says Pos@@ en , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate , and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think they should predi@@ ct that time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ li@@ da : small lif@@ ec@@ aid for refugees
&quot; more and more refugees come to Germany this day , too . &quot;
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of numerous volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ g@@ there , there are quite a number of people who support un@@ just asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and soul as a teacher .
with its 74 lin@@ ers she still teaches that she still teaches .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street . &quot;
&quot; it also helps to learn refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo , and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
of course this is quite different than the right school .
Brazilian Society Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition to whol@@ es@@ ome styles
&quot; the SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women &apos;s Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS , how important is good eating during the breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies every nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake was not the only dietary adjustment that ought to be carried . &quot;
&quot; a recent study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet has actually so@@ ared the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a un@@ healthy eating of the child can affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new amber of sports hall
&quot; the municipal council of Bern@@ ese approved the building for the 2,3 million euros in expensive sports hall . &quot;
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar systems .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ year@@ ling gy@@ mna@@ stics at the amber is step forward by step forward : in the recent shared key , the elabor@@ ated building application has been un@@ approved without further discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the board had decided to adopt an application for a &quot; &quot; correc@@ tive &quot; liberation of the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form in terms of roof construction . &quot;
a &quot; s@@ na@@ w &quot; roof with a non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof level shall be built .
&quot; planned planning is the planned use of roof surface for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderful large Southern roof together , &quot; said Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; again , it was directed to the roof of energy , which is oblig@@ ated for energy reasons - differently from the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan regarding the v@@ imp@@ ure no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ st@@ ature Council generally pass@@ eth from restri@@ ctive for liberation applications . &quot;
&quot; however , at the gy@@ mna@@ stics building , it is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; as St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gy@@ mna@@ stics for the sports centre is a community project for the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected by the school and performance promotion .
&quot; at the next end of the trial , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre @-@ metre hall is now submitted to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg &apos;s hospital should be closed early as planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees drag by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to P@@ ei@@ gh .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital &apos;s surprised , the Land@@ kre@@ ise in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the Supervisory Board is to call on the upcoming Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; the plans should be implemented , then all the almost 50 employees were employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should be moved to fishermen and the further existing interior to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who are not able to reach their work in W@@ eil@@ heim , is said to be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , as well as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
staff are informed of the plans .
&quot; triggered , the change@@ over of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the beginning , is now changing a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game who was ready to take direction and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au from 1 October . &quot;
&quot; in any event , there was a &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; and spread of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .

&quot; over the next two years , fisher@@ man is said to have agreed upon the next two years by his team if the board of directors run to the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ hip , which has over 35 beds in the next year , to finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the district had planned this in 2018 , when the current renovation was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also met with rum@@ ours that the house , owned by the German Emplo@@ ye@@ e , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future . &quot;
&quot; I close this . as soon as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White was not able to say there was several consider@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are a short @-@ term care in the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric service . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ ite &apos;s move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fisher@@ man has worked as che@@ ers for more than 30 years , didn &apos;t give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take up the post of the medical director .
&quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was continuously threatened with closure , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;

&quot; a susp@@ icious man has led the police to die , which had been missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the year @-@ listen , the 20 year @-@ old decided to kill the juven@@ iles and to have cast their cor@@ pse into a channel in rock bands . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is fallen victim to a victim of violence since Saturday .
&quot; the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the prosecutor and police were open on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a susp@@ ect , he was also a 20 @-@ year @-@ old boy who , in fact , stressed the st@@ illness and investig@@ ators to the foundation of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning , after she had not been at home on the eve after visiting a fall in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in search of young women , investig@@ ators first encountered the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
after a fac@@ eli@@ mit in the circle of friends and friends of the missing ar@@ rests resulted in a crime against the twenty @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the arrest , the authorities issued a link to the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and killed the dead in the canal . &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be demonstrated at the port tri@@ igh@@ ter on Wednesday .
&quot; in fact , the further investigation is meant to be informed about the circumstances of the circumstances . &quot;
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek to pay a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the fair competition on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compete with high @-@ income citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for paid flats , 400,000 new units have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
the result was a study on behalf of the &quot; Socialist construction of residential construction . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
many kick off the housing market and rows into the long sn@@ akes before its apartments .
&quot; however , according to the Federal Office of Statistics , however , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers were available last year . &quot;
but the negative development of residential property was not only in the rising refugees .
the study also makes substantial investments in residential policy of the last years .
&quot; Germany S@@ be a residential building in front of her , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; at present in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , the author of the study had already been missing . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many professionals are living in major cities in major cities in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed no longer stay in the &quot; Hotel M@@ om &quot; because of the bott@@ led water market .
&quot; in the major cities , the number of square metres per head decreased in the past years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing structure .
&quot; for this reason , the under@@ tak@@ fir@@ ing themselves could be wai@@ ved and the base tax for funded homes could be suspended . &quot;
&quot; according to the Alliance , we need to be attractive @-@ and @-@ locking possibilities . &quot;
&quot; in cities and municipalities , the refugee community proved well in cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; a good week after the start was up at 184 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the total available for some 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could be increased even . &quot;
refugees have free tickets : Croatia and Slovenia corridor a corridor
&quot; practically no transit to Hungary is practically no coming , since more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that Slovenia &apos;s journey to the north without any hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia aims to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia is home to Croatia , Austria and belongs to the Schengen area . &quot;
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the separation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken into Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; some 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL reports . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees by the day before .
&quot; new laws , which came into effect the same day , redund@@ ant asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , women , kids and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police seized the first refugees at the Serbian border in Croatia in the morning .
&quot; most of the media reports indicate reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
the refugees won &apos;t meet the f@@ ences in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
the strip strip has other dangers : there are still sharp mines there from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90s .
&quot; so , min@@ ors are now supposed to provide a safe passage . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungary , there are hardly more refugees to arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police were 3@@ 66 and@@ able people . &quot;
&quot; just before tor@@ sion on Monday , there were 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws en@@ forced the damage and damage from the border to an off@@ ense .
&quot; thus , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the south Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
sentenced to five years and his deportation in the country .
&quot; according to the Immig@@ ration Office , a total of 94 Asy@@ lan@@ ders were placed on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit ons &quot; on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - are located in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there will still be 40 refugees .
&quot; practically no one has any view , granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the final asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
before the &quot; Tran@@ ga@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees assembled .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to disman@@ tle miss@@ als .
they collected the tr@@ ash to leave tens of thousands of people in the road from the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and one of the admission camp in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the goal of this building .
Austria reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; but around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the transfer to Germany . &quot;
&quot; the train transport from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning . &quot;
in Freil@@ assing regularly visited small groups of refugees .
Mayor of the &quot; Pass@@ over &quot; over the border
&quot; we were facing a bridge building on Sunday with the premises , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ ess &apos;s Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany struck the rail traffic on Sunday because of the refugee war with Austria , it was for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , thus Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and the gest@@ ed together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars via the border into the Na@@ he Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we spent the un@@ trusted guest only once , with snack and beverages . &quot;
we just said we &apos;re moving it to Pass@@ au with the car .
&quot; that was obvious for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; he was unable to receive a donation , a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; this is very happy to us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the stro@@ ked train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train heading towards Pass@@ au , to get it after the short @-@ term announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still about the border . &quot;
&quot; the covering , however , was completed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein near the inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high . &quot;
&quot; the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours are soci@@ able on Sunday , previously a two @-@ bridge building - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án have to send further interest to us now , is a logical result of the seem@@ ingly holy policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately on the construction of structures to help human@@ ism , our Federal Chancellor has been highly officially and publicly decorated the attitude of the Hungarian government into the power of the National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
bon@@ y of this politics are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the eag@@ les will also have to state that the &quot; landed land , &quot; which she had invited and welcomed , nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge to seeking refugee flows and near Win@@ ters , with us to educ@@ ate human beings on protective clothing . &quot;
and there will be another greater peace - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in the quest of 35,000 bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
Konrad has had to do all hands fully with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is present in his way that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to make Qu@@ arti@@ ere for thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the first exceptional center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained its handle , Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the training of the 20,000 refugees that had come to Austria on Monday was without a great host , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master capacity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry spoke about a &quot; k@@ ins@@ ulting situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad came to the he@@ ur@@ red year as a demand of 8@@ 5,000 . &quot;
&quot; to satisfy the number , 35,000 accommodations in the coming weeks must still be found - 20.000 are expected to provide 15,000 people in the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should they be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the state capit@@ als , he has already engaged in talks . &quot;
these would have been secured to him even for the coming refugees to create Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; it works well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , there will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
the asylum @-@ Coordin@@ ator also sets great expectations on the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot;

Konrad and Mai@@ er crit@@ ici@@ zed the standards for &quot; accommodation as &quot; highly high yesterday .
&quot; in Not@@ ice , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have to hold a certain height of the towel holders or size of the lift . &quot;
for a temporary time the &quot; emergency standards &quot; would be valid .
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is successful in contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom you don &apos;t see un@@ truth in his face . &quot;
persu@@ asive force is its main weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to do any cost as they themselves stated .
their employees want to increase their number to three to four .
the own quiz @-@ search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz @-@ office .

Linz calls for a better breakdown
not until now there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning to arrange the City of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary in the moment when the people are concerned without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of emergency , however , further locations will be tested for their capability . &quot;

See@@ hofer : &quot; borders will not be sealed off
&quot; in a long telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) announced that further introduc@@ tions to the refugee community on Monday . &quot;
See@@ hofer has assured that the German borders will not be sealed .
refugees continue to continue in the Federal Republic of Germany .
&quot; however , there is now the respective border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the protective devices would be brought to Germany with regular trains to Germany . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger asked once more advanced solidarity in the refugee community . &quot;
&quot; then Austria re@@ direc@@ ts up controls over its borders , is for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the process of the Germans . &quot;
the next run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production buildings , the company &apos;s stock company S &amp; T has been moved , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he can imagine how to invest in start@@ up companies in the new ship@@ yard and later , too , which should become too ak@@ in . &quot;
&quot; even from the beginning , S &amp; T co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er himself promises a lot : &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; EUR 1.7 million were invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the City of Linz , Austria and the State of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is well cared for by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Centre .
&quot; 2700 square metres of residual surface in the building have already been rented , for an additional 40 percent of all remaining requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
actually J@@ utta was wanted to get a dog .
&quot; this project had to push the 49 year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : finally , it has now been adding an increase in the shape of another commercial . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , opposite the business , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , footwear and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around the for@@ &apos;s hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , the wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been converted . &quot;
&quot; but I have been thinking about whether I should open a shop , &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot;
&quot; crucial for the decision was , amongst others , that also the Fur@@ la producers to be at home in Bologna , from the idea of one &apos;s own site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only one who sell the brand in Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
she has expressed fashion interest in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
&quot; to me most , when something has developed and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices . &quot;
&quot; why such a woman looking at a nice hand@@ bag in bitter@@ ness , can also answer the professional woman with the latest security . &quot;
maybe it is in mind that a beautiful bag is used every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ äl@@ zer members of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot;
this feature combines man@@ cher also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether he comments on foreign host@@ ile , rep@@ udi@@ ger , or kno@@ w@@ ating knowledge in international crisis policy - candidates for the U.S. presidential election are s@@ wir@@ led to campaigns . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate @-@ billi@@ ard origin@@ ate . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept of many in the win@@ em@@ dorf near the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 habit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him about -@@ zig corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ess Simone Wen@@ del made a film about tre@@ ump .
and what will the vill@@ agers be thinking about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think you find the somehow exciting , but are not so much impressed in their K@@ all@@ po@@ y way , &quot; says Simone L@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ ais has made an am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous sho@@ oth@@ s , with which apart from Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not well @-@ known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; for king of heart , he has not brought it there . &quot;
&quot; indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds to think that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a grand@@ m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; listening to the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the area , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - at high German : the dealer , says she . &quot;
&quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village &apos;s village . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emigrated , and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ ging . &quot;
foundations of real estate company were first plot purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to the homeland , fail@@ ing at the Bavarian state , in which the Pfalz were then belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once had been removed without permission , the director of the Institute for Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a film release . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal out@@ mig@@ rant . &quot;
that is in contrast to the mit@@ e@@ worthy statements of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly claimed to be over@@ due on Mexican immigrants in the USA and requested the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as lik@@ ened , it isn &apos;t as lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement will see the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is still so many thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; Pen@@ in@@ ine Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons like some K@@ all@@ po@@ kes , a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family came to a visit to the church organ which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they do it better if he won &apos;t win the choice , for &quot; he has such a radical belie@@ fs , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had his grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the USA , would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ h@@ ist Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also mature without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els &apos;s film , which has been interviewed for Tr@@ ump , has seen 12 000 signatures , also awakening in the United States . &quot;
the Upper Bavaria village of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the Vice @-@ Pre@@ sidents at the German Alpine verein , Ludwig Wu@@ er@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the prize for gentle tourism . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages . &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring country , the alpine association is responsible for the awar@@ ding of the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area needs to be eff@@ ected as reserve .

&quot; Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson to report to Can@@ ber@@ ra , in order to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in evalu@@ ations for Today . &quot;

&quot; that dis@@ advantage of resistance seemed to play an Australian TV viewers , while Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators among the five capit@@ als , in comparison with Today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; Today adds a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today posted an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9,000 spectators on 3@@ 14.000 employees in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning more than Parliament !

the great novel@@ ty for seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of series of driving from the Raf@@ to the Raf@@ ting Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently , wit@@ ched father , who sh@@ uts down his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could have a hit show solo with the Raf@@ ting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 am to 17.@@ 30 pm ) , the new quiz @-@ show hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe found an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Chase Australia will definitely be confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 . &quot;
the Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly evi@@ dently he who wins the Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who eventually ends at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three left @-@ left girl will certainly not give away if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we present with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows the day before three two , you possibly have given a reference to those who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood does not hold his lips in the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left out in ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and called it his sense for humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get the final rose ? , &quot; could their answers to per@@ ver@@ sely affect those who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both quickly - except for itself , Mack@@ ay as best partner in Wood . &quot;
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood flew from the first day to a simple relationship .
&quot; from the moment when I came to the house ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ &apos;s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that the whole course of the show said , &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her &quot; , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are not suitable as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the home of the house last week , made it clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this obviously is not only a game - I am now already stopped to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell you this , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loved girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten in Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his re@@ location to the United States , and there were many other teams sent to an impressive log date end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some co@@ aches have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a little angel , as it did the Aussie Rug@@ by League conver@@ ts on Tuesday with his first score on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband , and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
&quot; rather than to grin@@ d his ro@@ ok@@ ies , he encouraged her to the mill . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ y Cam Ten@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by speci@@ al@@ um@@ ber coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to catch his un@@ coated mu@@ zzle and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented at a point which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota State Vik@@ ings
it certainly was not the start to Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ ologist for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that comes now , one takes care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne had compared the shar@@ pen@@ er with its Origin of the series in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area became a T@@ ry for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; free voters call for the high number of refugees , claiming the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; party and leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the start of the FW @-@ aut@@ au@@ c@@ ur in large fl@@ ashes before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if it is for the many new students not according to new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep the schools before the collapse , &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get ver@@ aging in the Bavarian Education System . &quot;
the annual elec@@ torate of Free elec@@ tors have dar@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
other main topics were originally planned .
but the record number of refugees is now domin@@ ating the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum seek@@ ers retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ an@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , so as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it does not go on , we need to get to the causes , &quot; said the Free elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; after asylum seek@@ ers , Free voters want to push for as fast as possible . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administration , which are responsible for asylum . &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the FW boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; we would need unified Federal standards of the German states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is wrong , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be portable , too . &quot;
but the state policy in the big wall@@ pap@@ a is not fall under the table .
a lon@@ gl@@ asting time of time remains on the agenda : the picture policy .
&quot; for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started the pilot testing &quot; Central plus , &quot; with an extension of the gy@@ mn@@ asi@@ ums center of three to four years - in the result it lasts for nine years as high as high school . &quot;
but that goes Ai@@ wan@@ ger not far enough .
&quot; the topic G9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss . &quot;
&quot; we call on freedom for gy@@ mn@@ asi@@ ums , who want to do so . &quot;
&quot; free trip to G9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

Google launches a double @-@ donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund campaign that aims to help thousands of refugees to help thousands of refugees who have invaded the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to dis@@ closure of donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google worker , who had fled with her family from Kabul , has her own personal experience as she was seven years old . &quot;
&quot; our journey belonged to many dark trains and bus@@ ses , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; as a result of the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe , people like my family desper@@ ately look for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google told that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / , called on goo@@ gle@@ .com , on goo@@ gle@@ .com , up to 11 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

for slightly exagger@@ ated diabe@@ tics can be useful loss of weight loss .
the benefits of loss of weight loss for overweight overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is too early to say if easily , overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss of surgery live longer than those who do not @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss Surgery , which wrote an editorial about the new trial in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss Operations or O@@ bes@@ ity Surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
you can reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absorb food .
&quot; in total , obesity has proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out with people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng general hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ Surgery - Mag@@ d@@ ypass and stomach mu@@ zzle - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes , which were slightly exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the average BMI of those operated on this operation , fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; however , the BMI of those who have non @-@ surgical treatments received approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who were subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes is totally un@@ affected and with 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes remained completely only by just one percent , and sometimes with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were performed at the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors discovered . &quot;
&quot; researchers also overs@@ aw the patients &quot; blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is kept most under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control , &quot; which reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , according to the CEO Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also util@@ ises average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , slightly observed in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete short@@ age of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of serious human beings in Sweden that surgery will lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people suffering from Adi@@ pos@@ itas operation , some 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower , without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , your body associated with obesity and diabetes is a reverse is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently increasingly popular in the Fiction : a young woman , too des@@ irable and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets the flock of their youth after years , and this fell in love with them . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; in addition to the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ hi@@ ker readers , since he plays in Lang@@ sch@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it &apos;s impossible to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; in Europe , not all refugees could receive , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real situation of the refugee crisis was in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders responded to end the violence in the refugees of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that in the conditions , the interests of humanity should be put to the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also emphas@@ ized that the reaction of western European countries might be ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation would not be appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to get to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; even though the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; finally , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , and exhibited that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ control@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , my dol@@ ences expressed in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but he made violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of in@@ gest@@ ion of disinf@@ ect@@ ants through children in the last 4 years
&quot; the US Po@@ ison Center will report on a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which are badly suitable for disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hands @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants increased in children under 12 years , which report Gi@@ ft@@ &apos;s Cent@@ res , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go through in the emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children have disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do they do to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ iny in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how to drink people disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents have report@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be ob@@ sc@@ aled by attractive fragran@@ ces of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ kes , which are very attractive for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sy@@ ring@@ es can already lead to alcohol pois@@ oning so very young children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the S@@ ander center at the University of Kansas , Director of the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let loose a si@@ ck whis@@ ky , but humans let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant into range of children , and when children are working , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ yers from the straw@@ berry inf@@ ancy disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school was brought into an emergency department . &quot;
&quot; the blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that legally considered to be drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah cho@@ ck her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency department .
doctors overs@@ aw the night in a separate children &apos;s hospital to signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma when the girl had fallen by the alcohol and kicked off his head . she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ t Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ble Mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; over alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected to death cases . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of post @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants which ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suggest that the product of me@@ thanol contained , contained a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was not@@ ated as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class plan@@ ed the fourth class in New York to pois@@ oning her &quot; &quot; teachers &quot; &quot; teaching an anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , so it reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant and made them from their room .
the police led the contra@@ ven@@ ed plan as &quot; gift &quot; and promised inter@@ disciplinary action to the school authority .

the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; in Holland , de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the old Fir@@ m .
they are talking about both teams and this is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars by D@@ eila . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted to play Celtic fighting , but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around . &quot;

&quot; D@@ eila said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had always been bad times , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly so - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that the player gets better . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole in the same period increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 % was 5.@@ 9 percent above the R@@ UK@@ s , as the numbers of the National Bureau of Statistics ( ON@@ S ) revealed . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 per cent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

why I witness a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a bit later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the pois@@ oning . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it &apos;s true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , as often as many applications are available , a ma@@ ver@@ ick lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , the ke@@ ess will be ob@@ sc@@ ess . &quot;
I cannot do that .
I will sit with Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps with my own relationship with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour .
I like the guy .
we often laugh so much when we speak .
&quot; the jail authorities say that I &apos;m not a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook , and a pin to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the history of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will receive access . &quot;
I certi@@ fy me with it .
&quot; she imag@@ ined that she could have thought &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she is still thinking that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
&quot; but he wants to be an international reporter , to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of Podcasts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go again to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a companion of deed .
but I believe that there is a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is wrong .
and I will see it from that perspective .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can turn on that .
&quot; what you will get from me is what it means to die a man to die unnecessary . &quot;

&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been enjoying a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know there was gone .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to leave the main source , and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m trying to try my best . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before that , Moo@@ dy had announced the bomb during an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Division had tried to explo@@ it his barn . &quot;
&quot; eight months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I &apos;m going to be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to be revealed that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed to believe me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , official President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , on the current CEO of Route L , were at present and are still today . &quot;
should I bring me to the mind that it personally gets ?
&quot; does the RV@@ L be afraid , and maybe people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going to do in the industry ? &quot;
am I po@@ or@@ ly to the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ated me , and I have no doubt that what I say they should think about it now . &quot;
&quot; now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will practice pressure on them and it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ gal levels of the trainer have established himself with the long continuous cob@@ alt @-@ investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could t@@ oss his licence on the table .
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the uns@@ ha@@ iled M@@ eist@@ ar Black C@@ avi@@ ar , which was called &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the pen , which led to the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take over full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has ast@@ ring@@ ent mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been so yesterday all day to be so .
but it had so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package at the racing day . an investigation of the affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who set these rules , do not know about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one went too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested for driver cur@@ s@@ ers
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a meeting with a cyclists and followed by the driver cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Motor@@ way .
&quot; the police said , the motor@@ ists continued to stop without stopping the injured rider . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia turned to the police in She@@ p@@ im@@ on . &quot;
he is expected due to be indicted for driver cur@@ s@@ als and interrupted assistance and due to other traffic disorders .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer - Bell@@ amy strikes back Ri@@ vals due to asser@@ tions
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators &quot; &quot; Ring@@ ve &quot; &quot; kicked off with his team during the high Storm @-@ Victory in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hard @-@ lasting note to the Storm team , after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday nights . he called the game a &quot; sample @-@ example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in the race . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ tic of his crew , telling me that she is only concentr@@ ating on her &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that criticism of two leading co@@ aches in his team are confident that they would be concerned with that they are worried , hit by the Storm team . &quot;
this shows up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fighting when she was 24 : 2 - said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ensive System or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es at an actual focus , and that has performed the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to get used to lose it so it was a bit of shock to him .
it is funny as it appears again at this time again .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has already attacked the idea of the &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds us that Benn@@ &apos;s St George Il@@ l@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons called the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring Football . &quot; &quot;
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; I remember that St George was a boring team in the year 2010 , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you are those kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all its kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build up confidence because they say these things , because they &apos;re a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it went around the Big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Game Storm against Roo@@ ster increased a higher result than the play Bron@@ co against Co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; to mention us , it means that we will arrive at them in a stage . &quot;
the Storm @-@ Team free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Serbia , with a 200.000 $ deposit to drug ad@@ diction &quot;
&quot; a man who may possibly be a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ ged to Queensland , was released over a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who arrested the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug in Sol@@ ay from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he co @-@ accused his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that he was trying to possess the entire quantity and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was the case of the flight of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relationships for Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; stated on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of the case , he served the police over his position . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars to a security in order to reach its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the sworn aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a certainty of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be sufficient to hold him out of it , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he dropped his Australian and his Serb Pass , where the police report on a daily basis and keeping an initial cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 for Karlsruhe : head of leadership breaks apart .
&quot; in a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three affected trucks had bra@@ ked before a permanent construction in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried to avoid in vain , at the last moment , to turn left to the police . &quot;
the executive house of the accident number@@ ing was completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
&quot; the A5 , between Bru@@ x@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord , was completely closed over six hours to 2 hours . &quot;
&quot; it originated in an amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
Stev@@ ens H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the telephone of the girl when this slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl a@@ woke up later and discovered that the phone l@@ acked and found it in the hand of the sleep@@ y H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found announ@@ cing news and al@@ armed immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; looked at &quot; web site , which used to search for in@@ consistent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the officials , H@@ og@@ g claimed that he would have done so as &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet would &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; pre @-@ decided to be a polic@@ eman , to sc@@ are them . &quot;
&quot; the State Coun@@ sel E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson told the Court of Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a Su@@ ch , - that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he said that the searches were done on the computer from him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are to sc@@ are . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and he asked , to send more photos . &quot;
he said that he did so to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson added : &quot; &quot; when the girl took the news on the phone , she called her mother and was weeping and weeping . &quot;
&quot; she also saw the def@@ endants in the telephone , and con@@ front the def@@ endants with it . &quot;
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said that the def@@ endant used computers and Play@@ station to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty on the charges of the indictment , to have incomplete pictures of children on the 14th of June of this year and not before a court appeared on 24 March this year . &quot;
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g doesn &apos;t appear in the register of sexual off@@ ender because one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; may be found in his head .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgement of October to get back@@ reports about social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for lack of hear@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; prior to the date of judgment , he was added to the directory of sexual off@@ ender . &quot;
to@@ wing soft to small border trans@@ itions to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up at the border controls in the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks saved from fear of discovery and capture the people multiply on smaller border trans@@ itions
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the federal police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn were picked up more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday . &quot;
were walking distance over bridges and storage on the German side .
&quot; there , they will be re@@ directed by federal police in reception and for@@ warded for registration . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police Department , in comparison with the weekly trial date , more refugees came again in the Munich Main station . &quot;
&quot; having arrived around 8@@ am in the state capital alone , a speaker said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had arrived in the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : runners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the South West
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to an high @-@ rise in Europe about Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , divided by the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong depth is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the tower &apos; Henry &quot; , which was pulled over the Atlantic crossing over the Atlantic last days . &quot;
severe storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning , it is also still in the Black Forest , in the weakness of Al@@ b and in the Lake District seek@@ ers with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hour kilometers . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can look back to the sun again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the speed@@ makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly popular with the compact car radios that are currently selling particularly well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , a lot of new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars . &quot;
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra to stand with dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra boasts an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; thus , the volume model is also well @-@ sold , the new Astra should also be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a starting point of the largest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the view , which starts at around 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra features a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline version . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel cuts the Opel Astra to first @-@ fifth the Opel Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variation will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also shown at the Frankfurt Show . &quot;
and what &apos;s next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e runs only as one @-@ five in a conventional and st@@ ressing sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; it comes to the beginning of next year , then as Com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ off@@ spin wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fit into the design line of the brand .
the basic model is a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in this offer , a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment , the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , made its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is calculated with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed , the compact model DS 4 compact , which is at the IAA ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ bot laid hands on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille has been drawn new and the changed head@@ lamps with LED technology was fitted . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced through a touch screen and is integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ play . &quot;
&quot; at the IAA in the compact class , adding new versions of over@@ work and new variants like the Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ted
&quot; the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht , issued a ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Mat@@ ter &apos;s Mat@@ ter &apos;s Mat@@ ters , which has been in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; in principle , because of the violation of their human rights , prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are located in small cells . &quot;
this is the decision adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a Wednesday decision .
those affected may now hope to hope for money if they were locked in confin@@ ed spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus a ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
&quot; after that , the man who had risen once again on the free foot from his lawyer , was put into a larger cell . &quot;
his adher@@ ence in order to the jurisdiction of the Land Berlin failed because of the dis@@ miss@@ able detention conditions .
but the Constitutional Court over@@ took the verdict of the Berlin chamber and rejected the case for new testing .
they see human dignity of man viol@@ ated .
chamber @-@ chamber now decides on the amount of the compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons were considerably issued by the request period only a few days of liability for the compensation , a claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be an attempt to fear the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damages .
the Constitu@@ tions in the past often have strengthened the rights of prisoners .
&quot; so they did not claim a prisoner of damage in April , because he was locked in a cell in the nude . &quot;
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 also the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe , on Wednesday , also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court that a det@@ ain@@ ee agreed to a decent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the time pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place over three months a day , between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ de case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons has also been hit the headlines in recent weeks .
&quot; prisoners will therefore always be imprisoned again for 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness of the aggressi@@ veness , even to stro@@ kes , it is said to have come in due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial press office 21 positions in Te@@ gel was not owned , 19 are expected to fail . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are shap@@ ing the &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to projections of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs within this year , approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany , in the position to under@@ go a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates a demonstration in light of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we are able to do this . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; it used to be used with different projections between 350@@ 000 ( the estim@@ ation of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( the estimate of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute ) housing every year , and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 250@@ 000 dwellings ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatically during paid rental properties : between 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the rental price per year , and in order to apply these particularly favourable homes for refugees too . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister for the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , aims to double the funding of at present 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is this from the perspective of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments had to arise and will have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in fact , scientists and Federal Minister for companies agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Occup@@ ational Research , 55 per cent of the companies in Germany can be employed in Germany over the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not have been questioned about their quali@@ fications in order to help them at entry , including Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the key must be the key for social contacts , based on the appreciation of the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the migrants , &quot; says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it has been a political turn in Germany : from labor law for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a working prohibition for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the resi@@ den@@ ces presented to asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
in society itself - also because of skilled workers - mostly the view of view that refugees should be faster to access the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing English .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient amount of choice in general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs are often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
this is why the start @-@ up of networking is therefore the top @-@ integration of the Königs@@ berg .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only few of their parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents it is only very important to cooperate with the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ a , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the benefits of the K@@ ita , dis@@ covers the hand@@ outs in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity at the Berlin Senate by learning more vocational schools . &quot;
students without German @-@ learning abilities are prepared for classes in the countries .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by full @-@ educated teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ aya from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German student union estimates that around 20 percent of refugees in Germany wanted to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no German asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ ted studies - the only exception to date has been Berlin , internal en@@ c@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its post@@ ure . &quot;
study consent might be facil@@ itated by access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a permit or Dul@@ ce , there are no more services after the asylum seek@@ ers of asylum , when they begin studying . &quot;
the latter is generally not a pedi@@ gre@@ e because they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ield people .
&quot; as far as four years in Germany , Ged@@ ul@@ ted refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for the outbreak of A@@ fr@@ ö@@ G ( January 1 , 2016 ) , that the Spanish margin will be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed . Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Stud@@ ents . &quot;
the students should immediately get an A@@ fr@@ ö@@ G immediately .
&quot; Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should gradually introduce the same rights as they have the churches and develop the existing state @-@ churches to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
&quot; the establishment of an Islamic welfare office , which takes care of professionally in the new@@ com@@ ers , would also be important . &quot;
obligations to the rights are also obligations .
&quot; in such a way , the representatives of Islam must unite and be ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and to prepare certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; this includes the read@@ iness , accept@@ ing religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the central council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern for religious conflicts in Germany on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; from now to time , those who wanted those conflicts in Germany would have their right to stay here in Germany at times , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more than a matter of society today .
&quot; in this way , the majority of majority rules will also need to change the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; although , Germany has more than a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination bodies and a general understanding of the Gender Equality Act . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ al show , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and groups of non @-@ white Germans are already calling for long and for what international agreement as the anti @-@ ra@@ ci@@ vic intervention has to become reality in the coming years if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should be able to use their new citizens - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical assistance to the most anticipated refugees , in general practition@@ er Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery commented . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we accomplish this , &quot; he said the daily level . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to be carried out into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all the trav@@ ellers in order to hire purchasing health cards . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , services could be calculated with the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
and long @-@ term it is highly question@@ able to report as many people with the limited power catalog which look for asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise the doctors make up the doctors of all the language barriers .
&quot; already until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been detected , displaced worse than their diseases has been clari@@ fied as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting are accepted , calls for them . &quot;
many also already helped many refugees also with more common health locations in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic glance .

Mont@@ gom@@ ery commented at her training with the partly other diseases of the disease .
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to identify . &quot; and what lack of doctors is , through the refugees , possibly even in sight . &quot;
Syrians would have a highly developed educational system ; some refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in practice to practice , however , they would have asked their qualification and re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed his tests . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany come to psychiat@@ ric psych@@ otherap@@ eutic agents ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ stress or depression . &quot;
&quot; especially viol@@ ating the refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z declares President of the B@@ Pt@@ k . &quot;
a recently published study of TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
&quot; anyone suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ disorder suffers , among other things , so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breath of breath , dizziness , heart shave , and pit@@ falls . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms , sleep and concentration problems , severe scre@@ aming and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent , that the symptoms would be chronic , an early treatment is necessary , declared amm@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill people get psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; indeed , psych@@ ically ill @-@ looking for asylum seek@@ ers can put a motion for a psych@@ otherapy , but usually the treatment lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , experts or doctors who are not educated for mental illness would either decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to false inv@@ ocation , says amm@@ z . &quot;

&quot; today , HP will be split into two listed companies and the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected figure reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , leading the unity of the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused on the HP today , and we have a wide and intensi@@ fied portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ pro@@ forma revenues and will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard was founded to create electrical systems and Palo Alto Garage you was born the birth place of the Silicon Valley .
HP has a massive re@@ structure to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .

arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb does have to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; W@@ enger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as long as his rehabilitation go according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certainly worth at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will be uncertain at the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le injury , and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; that kind of injury not threat@@ ens career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that was not healing well .
that is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries , which he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there are the associated danger of other injuries , always when one player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
&quot; Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut , six years ago . &quot;
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ y 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ s in the last five play times .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that it had been one of the eight play@@ times in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 which have been one of the two Premier League clubs .
&quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of the v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believed that improvement in the injuries rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have an an@@ gled time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will run through the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and around Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the coming Wednesday and W@@ enger turns a rotation within the teams .
&quot; the Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um and to hold the players who need it , allow a small re@@ ten@@ tion , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al clear favor@@ ites are , through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most important en@@ roll@@ ment effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the final season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was rock@@ ed on Tuesday through an earthquake , on the Richter scale 3 was measured . &quot;
this year was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions League @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains of the far hope , with its management to lead the association for its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in the business to real@@ ist@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendship festival : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friendliness
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open , now still desper@@ ate than ever has become , as self @-@ murder of young men on a 15 @-@ year ho@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged from 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Living ab@@ duc@@ ts ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ aign against a deliber@@ ate life ) 2015 than the year of a man with the aim of asking the culture in question , to seek help to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is in the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that , when the l@@ us@@ ement had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mind , &quot; the chances of gen@@ es@@ ome had doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellec@@ tu@@ ally healthy friends produce the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course one has to have some friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media , with its emphasis on style based on substance , the in@@ ability of response is often more important than in@@ significant . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have need to double , strong , fun and successful , doubles , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what Psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at the cost of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner long@@ ings to personal development and friendship that counter@@ acts on our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy money . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on his own head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by its work , but by its personality manipul@@ ating the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , mom@@ ments of football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the year@@ ning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can rely on each case , even if they often rest@@ ra@@ ct their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff member of the phone call declared it to me : ... &quot; my in@@ audi@@ ble role for people who feel reli@@ ant and confident , really showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; men who contact us , often do not feel able to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old familiar phrase &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you speak about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term ir@@ atory mechanisms .
it show@@ cases clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friendliness .
&quot; so much my objective outer @-@ status status via the telephone the people in sight of desp@@ air can also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend to visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know which difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets the PS@@ G to help Malmö
angel Di Mary is celebrating his hits with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh after his matches against Malmö .
di Maria is at his debut in the Champions League at Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move to Malmö .
here are the games and reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Mary and Edinburgh have held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain celebrated his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the stadium premises on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in less than four minutes after the Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master into the way , but afterwards , they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani had a head @-@ in in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A requires Paris a strong start against the Swedish master , since it is not only stri@@ ving the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
but while they were given the points it was not a class diagram of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team named Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics promised in front of his hom@@ etown . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the organisation where he already began his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to cause our opponents to cause problems and relaxed back even if there are certain things we need to have more perfect throughout the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; it is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won &apos;t win , although I regret it didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to Paris in a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was kicked out by Di Mary in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian government plane was called out as the man called PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was running in the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted as he finished in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass beyond the Malmö defense before he finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if somebody believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off hit the place to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field wi@@ red a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ ditions P@@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave itself up , with some ab@@ mis@@ ing and bad statements , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic that was patented in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ers into the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , that Di Maria was turned into a shoot at the pass by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored his sixth year of season , after accept@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished the left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the final result , before the substitute of e@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was finished in the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the Quali@@ fications are not enough . &quot;
watch from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola completed his change to FC Bavaria in 2008
world champion in Qatar since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar
&quot; Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the Spanish Super@@ star X@@ avi &apos;s commitment , which played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner winner , four times Champions League winner , two times champion champion , two times European champion , a time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ y X@@ avi is now that he &apos;s already standing before the Euro 2008 , before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; back then , Madrid was at that time nothing &quot; , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and the registered name of the Bayern Bayern . Bayern
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in memory , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern in the summer of 2008 . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi wasn &apos;t changed
but the change came not into effect .
and the resulting man is working today for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great role . &quot;
&quot; P@@ EP told me that I would not change , that he could not present himself without me . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ sy filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown as a discussion about the diversity and said , she won &apos;t need behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a episode of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke out as this the need of alternative perspectives . in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the selected script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then put it in the score of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
Brown responded to a sho@@ cked with offensive dis@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian noticed .
Dam@@ on and Brown entered the producers of products Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director of Harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and it is a Nut@@ te , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People have opted for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting his film on film ; Dam@@ on said their direc@@ ting &quot; at the end , what we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed and the social media explo@@ ded dis@@ appro@@ v@@ ingly on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; Twitter followers Ms Po@@ oni presented his anger over the clip , &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so it can explain its diversity - this is SO W@@ W that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Twe@@ et served more than 5,000 retri@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a point where the detailed r@@ att@@ ical representation in the media stands at the fore@@ front of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police by a white @-@ police force in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Movement in Poland increased strongly and urged the government to discri@@ min@@ ate non @-@ fer@@ oci@@ ous practices . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince set a nod to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards . &quot;
&quot; while listening was silent , ( albums always have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums are still in their importance . &quot;
&quot; in younger time , leaders of Movement Black Li@@ ves had published an explanation in response to the question of Fox News &apos; Queen Elisabeth Hass@@ el@@ beck , whether the group should be considered an hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
recently it has been announced that Dam@@ on was at a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le having invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;

&quot; professional sports climbing and control rides Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athl@@ ete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the contest @-@ Show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant to conclude all levels of their obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final . &quot;
the last mission was to rock climbing on a 75 ft long climbing gear in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the period with which he finished the first Ath@@ let , who completed the demanding stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge in three seconds faster than winner him vic@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had my life , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , even though he finished the course at the end , not received any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , money goes by the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it &apos;s the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price , and life changed , it gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he is h@@ opping about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ grandfather .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they have changed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended to an extended season to start fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers grinding at Minnesota T@@ wins
mint L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once before , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but they played perfectly against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins donated a chance to climb up to Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad dem@@ ics . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held an early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two inside ings then once in the sixth and then once in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) took 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside ings and allowed three rows .
it was only his third successful start to his final nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw at the Bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
the newly designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ us and his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit for Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; he worked well on the whi@@ pping , &quot; said Aus@@ p@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( kn@@ u@@ ck@@ ling ) , saw clearly better from the Bull@@ pen and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three pic@@ ks in the rear @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh interior the T@@ wins had their best chance to come again into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ d@@ Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ de Har@@ dy left handed . &quot;
&quot; this wall was run by Har@@ dy , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he has faced , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano who will get a two @-@ Run two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of le@@ aks and the finishing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor of Pl@@ ou@@ ches on a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was the major League leading in the major League for the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ le hit a double play . &quot;
&quot; after taking a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inside , this wall made an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed is S@@ ano with three pitch for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the match of the game by a still not mov@@ able Phil Hughes .
&quot; the tig@@ ers were awarded three R@@ uns in the first two inner points against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which had been painted in front of the game of the wear @-@ list , after he had l@@ acked more than one month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for me , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I feel better when I started trying to get some pretty good pitch in that third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ann gave a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ò@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he was trying to get to the third of the threat of the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers came in second to get a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he has not sm@@ itten particularly well but he caught the right spot .
&quot; as Hughes were in a pitch @-@ count , no points scored in the third inning , before he was replaced by the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ender &apos;s Rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed . &quot;
&quot; at Hughes , there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
note : tiger &apos;s R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez retired due to a violation of the root course .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Sanchez , from the middle of August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ tear , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the sp@@ ouse list to turn against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris started with 1 @-@ 1 at four times with the Tig@@ ers since it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July .
he has been bra@@ ced since 20 August due to a blocking in the right th@@ ig@@ h .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins are going to end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is going to play against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 and 4.@@ 73 )

&quot; I think that &apos;s illegal re@@ thinking about military action options not to take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective directions . &quot;

the EU interior ministers want to take a new call for a new attack on a non @-@ committ@@ al distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22nd September ) .
&quot; given the strong refugee movement in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the country with the first and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; on the end of Tuesday evening , the Federation with@@ held the government for nearly four @-@ hour consultations with the President of the German Chancell@@ ery at the Federal Chancell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who would need protection , be@@ ating them too . &quot;
but he who has no lead @-@ eye @-@ perspective could not remain in Germany either .
this view was dealt with in the turn .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole had to be able to overcome a &quot; huge strength . &quot;

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain much sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender , often dis@@ cour@@ aged from them . &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits yet : in them B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. Pri@@ mer@@ os mainly contain a lot of vitamin A and the pre @-@ amplifier beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ine .
&quot; those who eat the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when you buy , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or ste@@ ad@@ fast and pleasant smell . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ work color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green Mang@@ os can taste delicious . &quot;
you should store in room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet dishes .

Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal reading of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ bir@@ rone , one of the main works , painted the Ot@@ mar Alt for its Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and cont@@ ex@@ ts of Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture was form@@ ulated for Ot@@ mar Alt that has form@@ ulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and f@@ anci@@ ful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be quite strict . &quot;
&quot; around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on its Bible project , for which he has met a sub@@ jective artistic selection of the many subject areas of the &quot; Book of All books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that develop topics such as crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments or fath@@ er@@ land . &quot;
&quot; he has fascin@@ ated several partners spontan@@ e@@ ously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books . &quot;
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost referring to the basis of painting with the respective Bible verses .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus it has been translated into current lin@@ king . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; it is embedded in the artist &apos;s original Bible quote from Martin Luther and , to form a set of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thought on the particular situation . &quot;
the cost@@ ume parade has gold adventures .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; ultimately became a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict Protestant ruler . &quot;
&quot; then the up@@ bringing happened with the cane &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt , remembers . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work up , in order to im@@ itate myself again with the Lord his father . &quot;
his second aim is to re@@ inv@@ ent art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of image wel@@ ds is influenced by advertising today and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is dist@@ ressed because .
artists have a different desire and bl@@ iss to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and aren &apos;t decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let themselves see the viewer in the pictures , &quot; &quot; Leave them to operate , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost looked on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like he understands the life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; the Bible does not seem to be respected not to en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ate the Bible , but chosen for him , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; that wasn &apos;t a collaboration on eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ay : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; I have written a picture of images . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for the spot@@ light for both the ( biblical ) language of love and also the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be unveiled on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .

&quot; so hill deported up , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the approval will go in October and was able to announce the first community in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock from the Children &apos;s Youth and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year happens again , &quot; she said . &quot;
it was going to start without a &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fy commitment for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , with major signs in the Bundesliga . &quot;
&quot; football re@@ acts to the situation escal@@ ating in Germany , and protects the policy of its help in cop@@ ing with the problems . &quot;
&quot; I hold that for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that goes nothing to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interested every single , this subject in the grip , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel at the 23rd of September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am on the next Wednesday of the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic certainly is to play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and would help .
but the decisive moves must make the policy .
&quot; therefore , the German soccer federation supported his refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; for a four year round . &quot;
&quot; for the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; stated Kid@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some states also support this program .
this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ bre@@ ein then put a clear signal if on the left tri@@ cot @-@ mel when lying on the left ank@@ le name ( Hermes ) the appreciation &quot; We will help . &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; will be registered .
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and as they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen leader Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Painting &quot; Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ vocal . &quot; &quot;
&quot; refugee drama res@@ umes every man , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football @-@ cou@@ stic , no , we need to use our brilli@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have been so incredibly suffering , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ Gentile managing director Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; &quot; prominent icon of the league . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women took 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on this Friday . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach applied the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements had launched their own projects , be magnificent . &quot;
the same is that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; which we have spent will live in football .
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government sets 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have sum@@ mon@@ ed the whole sum for 2015 as well , &quot; related to Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stop , when you fall down . &quot;

&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us was finally crushed in the European League &apos;s first group game . &quot;
the national player is also missing the championship leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FR@@ G Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .

&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach will be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high pressure of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ ry to the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place on the square b@@ art@@ ender novel Bür@@ ki .

&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used for the future in all Europe @-@ League play , Tu@@ ch@@ el left however open . &quot;
at high li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood he will also contest the second game .

robot@@ ic cars : government wants to act on leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany will be the change in the pace of the technological pioneer . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Home Secretary of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Autom@@ esse Motor Show from a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; the automated and net@@ worked drive will increase traffic safety and make for less traffic , Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his counterpart from the G7 countries , which came together with representatives of the industry . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper from the Austrian Ministry states , among other things , st@@ resses the importance of the mobile broadband development and swi@@ ft shift to digital radio monitoring . &quot;
&quot; for testing new technology , a test track is currently being developed on Highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; after raising the driver &quot; no additional Dis@@ claim@@ er &quot; , the German government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ roughly international that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government also aims to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , so far only men can see it as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving , the car takes over the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to passenger . &quot;
&quot; technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which detect the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving to motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; however , Vi@@ enn@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far back to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added by the driver assistance systems , and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany , estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of p@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency under traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic sp@@ ol@@ ition@@ ist S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the issue of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly explained . &quot;
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars see sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ Institute at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA is coming to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be held in the next ten years , 32 per cent believe only 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 will be able to increase by 33 per cent by 2025 . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital feder@@ ations , only seven percent would agree that they will be eliminated during the entire journey across all the roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , this could be at least 15 percent in the running traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; good to everyone , the car would leave the car under any circumstances . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a completely great fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ man @-@ champion : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are terri@@ fying by video projections . &quot;
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer who was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he was wearing men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ cap@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was originally ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September to the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his position to a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he was against it because : &quot; an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
when you die comes to the museum .
&quot; the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and in Paris . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s barely visible work of the man , who has written the fashion history , without ever completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; the show is not built in chron@@ ologically , but it has been a super@@ natural chore@@ ograph@@ ed total of art for which a lot of effort was worked : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist was hired for example . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the curator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot lost 14 tons of material . &quot;

&quot; he has always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are lock@@ ers than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is also to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , inst@@ able mo@@ dic Geh@@ versuche of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he was attracted to his ted@@ dy architect B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
the dis@@ card of fashion he subsequently went to himself later .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion perio@@ dic@@ als and looked at the designs of other designers , including Gaul@@ tier told in Munich . &quot;
&quot; later on , I bought the then bought . &quot;
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to maintain the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of s@@ ard@@ ine - Pl@@ um@@ ener top as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; previously , it went on the long embroi@@ dery mil@@ s in and around Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered substances and lace emerged in large amount for customers , which they worked for example to ceilings and gar@@ d@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; today this is not working anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the lead screw . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early seasons of Pl@@ au@@ ener , Mode played a larger role , was then re@@ pressed by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; even now , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stal@@ ks , an increasing client potential . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , who has no power in the textile branch in Germany , no longer is on the market . &quot;
they account for half of all orders .
lead ice Pl@@ auen is together with nine further companies member of the industry @-@ associated pl@@ au@@ ral tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can bear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of its sales have been broken off . &quot;
private business and also the wholesale accounts are almost no more .
our products hardly achieve our customers in this way .
the mass goods may be produced much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and is driven almost exclusively through chains .
&quot; besides , we are driving jobs , currently based on Russia and the United States . &quot;
so enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ der in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; it also refers to the materials used .
diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger department of the Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
&quot; in order to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian region , you must find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is an area of tension between the fres@@ her ideas of designers and factories , which must be particularly economical , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design often become only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; some years ago , inspired textile design@@ ator Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly developed the historical screw top . &quot;
the machine st@@ ates small cu@@ ffs at some places .
&quot; the pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ men in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ x had inspired him to inspire him : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t start any point with traditional pl@@ au@@ ral tip . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ y tip for her jewelry .
in a complex technique she character@@ izes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ral tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies in the USA , Australia , and Finland - mainly due to customers who like living in store and surroundings , and would like to talk about the piece of commem@@ oration . &quot;

EU wants to double @-@ level mercury in big fishing
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large big fishing , thus reaching a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a valid employer on the EU , crit@@ ici@@ zing the plans in sharp : &quot; risks and side effects were lacking in industrial and environmental policy , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , according to the limit values for large fishes , at the end of food chain , such as shar@@ ks or wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; will be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are still so strongly exposed to mercury in the fact that some 50 per cent of the threads can not be sold based on the existing limit values .
&quot; after dou@@ bling the mar@@ g@@ inal values , only 14.@@ 5 percent are un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in turn , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU plans to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Pe@@ ac@@ qui@@ ds , such as car@@ p mostly bur@@ dened so low , that they already have the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the lowering of the file is therefore a per@@ fi@@ des de@@ fle@@ ction tool that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is highly toxic to humans that is strongly increased over the food chain above all in big fishing .
&quot; for this reason , the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; small amounts may cause severe damage in damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the valid peak , the Federal Ministry of Environment declared that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population will not be expected . &quot; &quot;
mercury comes mainly through coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the Federal Environment Agency , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ischer ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume of Germany em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; mercury in fish , in the river El@@ be , Rhine , and Danube must be &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; was quoted in March of paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings from mercury in fish have already followed the most common health risks in the EU warning system of R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
