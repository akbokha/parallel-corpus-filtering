&quot; ( 2 ) Str@@ ass@@ vehicle or containers , which are no longer to match for its approval , may only be used for the transport of the customs fees when their original condition was restored or the vehicle b@@ z@@ w . the container has once again been approved . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) For the temporary import of road vehicles , trucks or containers used in the Ti@@ r procedure , is not a special customs document . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) paragraph 1 does not prevent a contractual party , to demand that the determin@@ ations of the legal rights provided for domestic law to make sure that after conclusion of the Ti@@ r @-@ Tran@@ sports the road vehicle , the load @-@ train or containers is re@@ executed . &quot;
&quot; vehicle vehicles or loading , which have to carry out an animal @-@ transport , need to be in front and rear a calcul@@ ator , the characteristics of the plant 5 corresponding table with the inscription &quot; &quot; Ti@@ r &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these tablets must be attached so that they are well visible ; they must be removable .
( 1 ) For each vehicle vehicle or each container is a separate Car@@ net Ti@@ r .
&quot; a single car@@ net can be made for a load or a number of containers , which are loaded on a single road vehicle or load . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , the content of the Car@@ net Ti@@ r of the content has to be listed for any truck or any vessel . &quot;
there must be at least as many separ@@ able acceptance - and prepar@@ atory cuts , as required for the transport required . &quot;
&quot; an animal transport must be carried out over a number of down@@ fall - and certain determin@@ ations ; in case of the contractual party or by the parties involved , no other regulation has to be taken , a ) must be the ab@@ duc@@ tors in one and the same country ; &quot;
( B ) must not be located in no more than two different countries ;
&quot; the goods and the road vehicle , the load @-@ train or the tank are the access point to the Car@@ net Ti@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the customs authorities of the current country meet the necessary measures to convince yourself of the accuracy of the goods , or to check the customs fees under their responsibility for a large number of customs . &quot;
&quot; the customs agencies can be fixed for the journey through their country , and demand that the vehicle vehicle , the load , or the container a prescribed route . &quot;
&quot; the car @-@ vehicle , loading or containers are to be found with the inventory , and the Car@@ net Ti@@ r of any thorou@@ gh@@ er point and the destination point to control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The thorou@@ gh@@ far@@ es of each contractual party usually recognise the dis@@ closures of the other contractual partners in the last customs , unless a compl@@ ain@@ ant of goods according to Article 5 paragraph 2 will be made . &quot;
&quot; however , the customs agencies cannot create if this is necessary for control , in addition their own customs fees . &quot;
( 2 ) The provision of a contractual party to be able to enjoy the same legal protection in their territory such as the national customs fees .
&quot; customs authorities may only be accompanied by exceptional incidents - the road vehicles , lor@@ ries , or containers in their country at the expense of the transport . &quot;
&quot; - on the way to control and make a description of the cargo of commercial vehicles , trucks or containers . &quot;
&quot; take the customs agencies a resolution of the discharge of a road vehicle , a truck or a vessel to be used in their country , they have to be used on the Car@@ net @-@ Ti@@ r sections , which are used in their country , on the corresponding gene@@ alog@@ gers and on the type of controls carried out in the Car@@ net Ti@@ r remaining sections . &quot;
&quot; customs inclu@@ sions shall be viol@@ ated or damaged in other cases than in the articles 24 and 35 , so after the protocol contained in the article 1 contained instructions for the use of the Car@@ net Ti@@ r procedure and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net Ti@@ r protocol ; the inter@@ state legislation remain unaffected . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) touches a transport with Car@@ net Ti@@ r on a part of the territory of a state , which is not the party &apos;s party , thus the Ti@@ r transport is exposed to this territory . &quot;
&quot; in such a case the customs agencies of the contractual party , by whose area the goods are subsequently promoted , for the continuation of the Ti@@ r @-@ Tran@@ sports the Car@@ net Ti@@ r , as long as the customs inclu@@ sions and / or nails may have remained intact . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The same goes for the part of the route , on which the owner of the Car@@ net Ti@@ r in the field of a contractual party cannot be used , because simpler procedure for the customs declaration may not be required or the use of such a procedure is not required . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In such cases the customs fees apply , where the Ti@@ r transport is exposed or re @-@ recorded , as a passage of access to the output b@@ z@@ w . access point at the entrance . &quot;
&quot; subject to the provisions of this Convention , in particular of Article 18 , the original identification module can be replaced by another determin@@ ations . &quot;

&quot; all provisions of this Convention , of which the particular rules of this section do not devi@@ ate , also apply to transport un@@ usually severe or lock@@ able goods in the Ti@@ r procedure . &quot;
&quot; the liability of the natur@@ alization Association extends not only to those found in Car@@ net Ti@@ r , but also on goods that are not stated in Car@@ net Ti@@ r , but on the surface area or between the goods included in the Car@@ net Ti@@ r . &quot;

&quot; the access point can demand that sp@@ ell@@ ists , photographs , plans etc . , which are required for the tail@@ oring of the specified goods , the Car@@ net Ti@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in this case , they will see these papers with their stamp , always stap@@ les on the back of the Car@@ net @-@ Ti@@ r fence and notes it in all the invent@@ ories . &quot;

&quot; the organization is justified and obliged to ensure that security measures are applied to all peaceful nuclear activities in the territory of the states , under their high power or under their control in any place , whereby this material is not rep@@ ented for nuclear weapons or other nuclear power body . &quot;
&quot; a ) The community is committed to working with the application of their security measures at the outcome , and to collaborate with all peaceful nuclear activities in the territory of the United States with the Organization for accepting this Convention , in order to make certain of the peculiar process of nuclear weapons or other nuclear energy bodies . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The organisation applies to their security measures in accordance with the provisions of this Convention , so that they can re@@ prove the soli@@ dation of the system of the Community by doing so that no core material was derived from the peaceful use and used for nuclear weapons or other nuclear power body . &quot;
&quot; the examination by the organization includes independent measurements and observations by the organization , based in this Convention established procedure . &quot;
&quot; at its after@@ examination , the organization of the effectiveness of the security system will be charged according to the compliance of this Convention in due manner . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States work together , as far as every contractual party is concerned , in order to facilitate the implementation of the actions provided in this Convention ; they avoid unnecessary bi@@ ographies in the field of security measures . &quot;
&quot; the security measures provided in this Convention will be carried out so that they constitute a ) disability , for economic and technological development in the community or for international cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities , including international exchange of nuclear material ; &quot;
&quot; B ) does not represent any un@@ due surgery in the peaceful nuclear activities in the Community , in particular in the operation of the systems ; &quot;
&quot; C ) with the customs of a pru@@ dent operating system , how they are required for the economic and in@@ experienced execution of nuclear activities . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation meets all precau@@ tions to protect business and industrial secrets as well as other confidential information , of which they have taken note of the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( II ) summar@@ ized information on core material , the security measures related to this Convention , can be published on resolutions of the Council and with the consent of the immediate affected States or the community , as far as each of the two parties involved will be published . &quot;
&quot; a ) In the implementation of security measures based on this Convention , the technological development in the field of securing measures will be taken , and it will be subject to ensuring optimal cost effects and the application of the basic approach to effective security monitoring by using instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points , as far as current or future technology enables this . &quot;
B ) The guarantee of the optimal cost of effectiveness are used for example : I ) spatial calcul@@ ator as a means to establish the material zones for the quote .
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the verification proc@@ ates on the phases of the concentration camps , which may affect the production , processing , use and storage of core material from which without further nuclear weapons and other core br@@ ittle frac@@ tures , provided that this does not hin@@ dered the implementation of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The effective implementation of the security measures of this Convention provides the community of the organization in accordance with this Convention Information on nuclear material , the security measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment that are responsible for carrying out the security measures relating to this material of si@@ ang . &quot;

&quot; ( II ) Information about plants will be restricted to the minimum measurement , which is necessary for the application of security measures relating to nuclear material , which is subject to security measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On the request of the community , the organization is ready to order investment data that the community is considered especially vulnerable to consider in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data need not to be transferred materi@@ ally , as long as they remain accessible for further testing by the organization in the premises of the community without further access . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation draws the approval of the community and the states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) the community rises either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a designation , the organisation of the community and the states proposes one or more altern@@ ate benefits . &quot;
&quot; III ) Sol@@ es received due to the repeated denial of the community , the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization , thus the Council is referred to as the General Manager - in the following as &quot; &quot; General Manager &quot; &quot; - in order to meet the objective of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The community and the affected states are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually conver@@ ge them according to their conven@@ tions , tasks . &quot;
&quot; C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up so , that i ) possible the potential har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspection of the peaceful nuclear activities as low as possible ; &quot;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization to be aware of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each State is turning to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials to submit the tasks of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the security measures after this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material , when the community and the organization had to determine that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is suitable for a nuclear activity that has become longer usable or practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
the community notes the organisation according to the compliance of this Convention is subject to passing on core material from the states that is subject to security measures according to this Convention .
&quot; the safegu@@ ards after this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as provided in this Convention , is responsible for the responsibility of this Convention . &quot;
the organisation takes documents from which each transfer and if necessary the re @-@ application of the backup measures will be applied to the content @-@ given nuclear material .
&quot; should nuclear material , the security measures are subject to this Convention , is subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramic , so agreed the community with the organization of such use of material , under which circumstances the security measures have been completed in relation to this material . &quot;
&quot; II ) that the ker@@ age is not used during the duration of the non @-@ application of security measures , according to the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The organisation and the community will make a provision in the context that the security measures used in this Convention are not used , as the core material is used in such a activity . &quot;
&quot; the regulation will be defined as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these security measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the security measures will be used again in this Convention as soon as the core material is attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization will be held on the total quantity and composition of this in the country or in the countries concerned and on any passing of such material out of this state or these states out of the current state .
&quot; this explains its consent as swi@@ ft@@ ly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as inter alia , temporal and proced@@ ural provisions for reporting , but does not include a tri@@ l@@ ending or partial secrecy knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the success of the core material . &quot;

&quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which for each material @-@ sharing zone the core @-@ material continu@@ ance and the changes of this stock , including the one and the outputs of the material zone ; &quot;
( g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that the accounting procedure and agreements are done correctly ;
h ) Proc@@ ed@@ ures re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; to ensure the security measures of this Convention , do not extend to material in mining or the arrangement . &quot;
&quot; B ) is passed Ur@@ an - or th@@ ory material that has not yet reached under ( letter c ) phase of the core fuel cycle , so the community of the organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves nuclear material , which is designed according to composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , in which it is manufactured , or becomes the core material or other , in a later stage of the core @-@ fuel cycle of nuclear material into the States , so it is subject to the others mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the provisions mentioned in this Convention are provided for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 of the conditions . however , the community is subject to claims that the reg@@ aining of nuclear material , the security measures are subject to this Convention , is not possible or even desirable , so consult the organization and the community to each other on the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;

C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centric of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 that is over 80 % .
&quot; in search of the community fre@@ es the organisation of core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures on this Convention , provided that the whole , due to this article in the States are released at no time more than &quot;
a ) A single kil@@ ogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enri@@ ching of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by a multip@@ lication of his weight with the sub@@ mitting , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enri@@ ching that is under 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by a multip@@ lication of his weight with the twenty @-@ year square of the sub@@ missions ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural ur@@ anium and rounded ur@@ anium from more than 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons of contaminated ur@@ anium from 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or among them ;
&quot; should liber@@ ated core material together with nuclear material , which is subject to security measures according to this Convention , will be processed or stored , thus precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ application of securing actions on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplements which are required to the extent that is required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization after that Convention , in particular determine how the procedures specified in the Convention established procedure . &quot;

the special account will be separated and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic guilt of member states , who are to pay upon request in the currency of the organisation in the order of the organisation as a manager of the organisation in the country in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The payment is made in two pensions , namely i ) the first in height of at least 45 v . h . rate within 30 days of the agreement entered into force or another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second amount required in the amount of the fee to the 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the necessary requirements required for the parliamentary consent of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments before the above dead@@ lines .
&quot; the administrator takes in accordance with the usual procedures of the organisation about disproportion@@ ate drawing to the cash or the school@@ cone , in order to cover the expenditure for the special rates and balance the special account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of this loan , the administrator can lead to the terms of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
III ) the scope in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the trend of the country and its further loan capacity to loans do without delay ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special loan provides funding to the financing of a clear and rapidly pay@@ able development program or supplies , regardless of whether it is to be approved for the organization of the organization , or not , according to the procedure and practices that is to be considered by proper funding of the organization , the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the Special Commission must not be used instead of establishing the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which in the context of a loan or credit for a programme or projects have been approved by the directors of the Bank or Organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 are subject to the same payment method for the same payment terms , which apply to the organization responsible for the organization , they are refundable in 50 years , respectively in 50 years . &quot;
respon@@ dents are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
&quot; in the amounts to pay for the payment of these commandments , directly to the organization , which it re@@ tains . &quot;
&quot; every kind of special loan is determined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the means . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from every special transaction can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured b@@ z@@ w . ii ) in developing countries , members of the organization are determined to be the manager at the time of the loan granted , recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; capital pay@@ outs of special rates take place on the special account , and the amount paid in this way into the currency of a membership fee is to be re@@ marked as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State . &quot;
the administrator is taught up to the full allocation of all special treatment for the EEC relating to the directors in preparation and through the directors approved projects and programs .
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special ac@@ tional loan , the administrator has taught the EEC based on the development of the special rates and the expenditure of these issues . &quot;
&quot; the administrator communicated the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization , a detailed account of the editorial account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; following a full payout of the special rates , the administrator is transferred to the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the project financed by the special account projects and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and performs suitable records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the account account , which received from the account orders to finance and pay@@ outs from the account paid out and pay@@ outs to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; in this context , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrators to the full issue of funding from time to time a thought exchange on the state of the Special Commission funding , the advanc@@ ement of the programs of financial programs or projects and on all other issues related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;

human perfection is that of a healthy man nom@@ inate and mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
C ) which cannot be free from blood trans@@ fu@@ sions as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
&quot; blood decrease is made as@@ ep@@ tically ; the blood is derived through a closed , sterile tube @-@ system into a sterile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ar is inserted before the steri@@ lization . &quot;
&quot; after completion of blood circulation , the bottle is immediately shut down and cool to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , they may only be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant must not exceed 220 ml per liter of human perfection , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in centr@@ ation must not be interrupted by 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood @-@ group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to determine before the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by exam@@ ining the blood cells at a new sample of donations .
&quot; as far as it gives for blood group@@ ings in individual countries , or recommended procedures , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; use R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific investigations have revealed the non @-@ enforcement of the anti@@ gens C , D , you and E . &quot;
&quot; according to this Convention , the blood should only be used for recipient of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot;
&quot; the human perfection has been protected in sterile , sealed bottle from micro@@ organisms , and up to its use on a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport necessary times , which is at most 30 minutes to cool off on 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentration of human blood cells is a unity of human perfection , from which the largest part of the plasma is removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been won ; other blood cells may be present , or may be partially removed . &quot;
the fluid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water @-@ based solution that was placed after the distance of plasma .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ wer volumes ( hem@@ at@@ ocr@@ it ) is on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes necessary for the production required must be made under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the closing system must be done under the use of a ster@@ il@@ en , closed system and only pressure . &quot;
