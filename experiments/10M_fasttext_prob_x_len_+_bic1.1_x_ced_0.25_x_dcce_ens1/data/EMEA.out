this document is a summary of the European public debate report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the research committee has been assessed in order to access recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need further information on your disease or treatment , please read the package line ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; for further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg m@@ elt tablets ( tablets that can dis@@ solve in the mouth ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. ra@@ vel thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and mani@@ ac disease ; • bi@@ polar disorder , in which patients have normal mood ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is used for treating moderate to severe some severe episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes associated with patients , which have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is applied to the fast control of disp@@ ar@@ dent anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for one or the melting table in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets are difficulties . &quot;
&quot; for patients who use other medicines simultaneously , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works as a &quot; parti@@ san ag@@ onist &quot; for the receptors of the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called serotonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters acts to activate the receptors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin with schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and to prevent its re@@ occurring . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy , the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was investigated in three studies about up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies involving 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which l@@ acked up over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has had twelve weeks of 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operated dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have been res@@ ized to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was placed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which occurred on irrit@@ ated rest@@ lessness , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients treated to treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the furn@@ aces and the solution to the inhal@@ ation ( recorded ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms of ei@@ ving rest@@ lessness than the patients received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms are more effective than placebo . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of long effective than placebo the re@@ occurring man@@ ic episodes associated with previously untreated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of ei@@ pped rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ ial disorders , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( nausea ) , relap@@ ses ( nausea ) , irrit@@ ation , nausea , in@@ som@@ nia ( nausea ) , irrit@@ ation , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia , and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of disp@@ ar@@ dent anxiety and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes associated with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
June 2004 shared the European Commission to Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is prescribed for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day every day regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness at dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients suffered 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initiation dose should be considered if clinical factors justify these ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is eliminated from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psychological therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder not elevated risk of addiction to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ tis , cardiovascular disease , respiratory disorders , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ignant forms ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ ed@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials published a year or less , there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if in case of a AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a vas@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient developed signs and symptoms which point to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ol@@ es in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with states that are related to var@@ ic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an elevated mortality compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were studies in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted cr@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients reported with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no exact risk ass@@ ess@@ ments to Hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated to have direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ ges and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight is generally schizophren@@ ic in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight is known as a side effect and could cause severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , be@@ ware is offered when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , with this effect as clinically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy prob@@ es , an extremely effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibitors ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to 107 % , while the C@@ max remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore should be similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites can result in common application with high @-@ effective inhibitors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ ders Met@@ abol@@ ism .
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibitors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail with potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibitors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ers , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; after dis@@ closing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibitors , the dosage should be lifted to the dosage at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be admin@@ istered with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be considered with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ able concentrations .
&quot; clinical trials showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a day no significant effect on the metabolic rate of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ method morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ bo@@ zene ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their physician when they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data position on the safety of people and due to the concerns raised in pregnancy outcomes , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) to than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , in patients suffering with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients infected with semi @-@ operated dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from placebo .
&quot; in a different controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ i treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients suffering from semi @-@ surgical treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term recovery phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ la treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clinically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ous laboratory parameters occurred , revealed not medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , have been observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the effects which may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and over their occurrence has been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , abnormalities and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
clinical studies and since the launch were un@@ intended or inten@@ tional rem@@ uner@@ ation with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
&quot; although no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is unlikely , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ aly@@ sis is characterized in the treatment of an over@@ dosage , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high level of plasma tor@@ ment . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and serotonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptors and an antagon@@ istic effect on serotonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a receptors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and the serotonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recipes , as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to serotonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and to the Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ form@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; with gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the Pos@@ it@@ aine E@@ mission @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction of the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor , the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a half @-@ operate i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , in week 52 the proportion of the Respon@@ sive patients who teach a response to study communication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and semi @-@ operated dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from read@@ sheets , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ mine cleaning scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with semi @-@ operated dol . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia showed itself significantly higher reduction of the relap@@ ses that was found in 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schizophren@@ ia , over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients dealt with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder shown Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole opposite placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ y and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and an maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operate i@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ie on such as lithium or semi @-@ operated dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic drugs that were partially over 2 weeks not on li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeu@@ tical Ser@@ otherapy in a reduction in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time exp@@ ung@@ ing phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients suffering with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , faced with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in preventing a relap@@ se in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ zing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ sen is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the average elimination of elimination of 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 14@@ 6 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) , metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ological investigation showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a regular @-@ specific evaluation of the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic yiel@@ ded no indication of clinically significant differences in the ethnic affili@@ ation or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single @-@ dose study carried out with various eng@@ radi@@ ger liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the damage of the liver function to the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ as@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeti@@ tive gift , reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity and the can@@ cer@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data left no special dangers for man . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological effects were only observed in doses or expos@@ ures , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited amounts to clinical application only limited or no significance . &quot;

&quot; the Abra@@ x@@ ane effectiveness was investigated in a major study , at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters of earlier had a Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) has been compared with the conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel compound . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , in terms of efficacy of disease and survival , there were no difference between medicines and drugs . &quot;
&quot; however , in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel drugs . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied in people who have the breastfeeding , or before the start of the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ any numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human health care ( CH@@ MP ) fixed that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with which the first treatment has no longer strikes , more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel drugs , and that it has to be given as opposed to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel drugs , not to other medicines to decrease side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission shared the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited , a permit for the acquisition of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not displayed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy is not displayed ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ number &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced in the following series to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; for sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grad 3 the treatment is to be interrupted , until a improvement to degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate inhi@@ bit of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies done with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dosage adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ments of the renal function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of non @-@ sufficient data to harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulate of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel that could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately be dra@@ ined and symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients there should be no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles , until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic count continues to be increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; whilst a clearly demonstrated with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity is not proven , car@@ di@@ ale events in the indigenous patients are not unusual , especially in patients with former Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tika and con@@ stric@@ ting means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women of child@@ bearing age , which do not use effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoidable . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , will be enriched , during and up to six months after treatment no child to bear . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised in the treatment of sper@@ mac@@ a , since therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
abrasion can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of the patients reported ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ ance ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed with 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 are the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; &quot;

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of the hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection with a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no formal connection with these events . &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules ingredient that promotes the cl@@ ashes of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ loy@@ ments .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ary network that is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ine conve@@ ys the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis from plasma components into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and within the frame of vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transportation is conve@@ yed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ recep@@ tor and has a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two incar@@ nat@@ ed un@@ ed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparison study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients were treated with metastatic breast cancer with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received all 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had no chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adjuv@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy , are presented below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients , which at a time during therapy has been a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 . &quot;
the natural course of peripher@@ al Neurop@@ athy for the sound on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient ( Au@@ c ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous , Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma based on multi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic ways . &quot;
the average capacity volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a wide @-@ ranging extrac@@ vascular distribution and / or distribution of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 mg / m2 with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solution @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the clearing of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift ( 43 % ) , and the distribution volume was increased at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human micro@@ micro@@ some and tissue structures , p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is reported primarily to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) metabolic syndrome .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 , the average dose of cum@@ ulative ureth@@ ra was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ etic Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , over patients aged over 75 years , there are only a few data available since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above all light @-@ protected light more than 8 hours .

member states need to make sure that the owner of the approval for the market will be provided before the market for medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Education brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( expert information ) , labelling and pack carrier . • With unique image of the correct application of the product accidentally cooler for transport through patients . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also &quot; reference to reference &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood bacteria , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if prior to the procedure a self @-@ bleeding is not possible and in which a loss of blood is expected from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is shown . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding appearance , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; injection can also be made from the patient or of his supervis@@ ors , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients suffering from chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults and between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the rail@@ ings of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients infected with kidney problems , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ inal deficiency or thereby , that the body does not affect the body &apos;s own ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene was introduced into the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; cancellation was used as an injection into a v@@ ene as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients referred to one by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , with the reference of reference . &quot;
all patients had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in an inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they were either raised to se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indication of the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the examination period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also commissioned the results of a study conducted in which the effects of the spra@@ yed ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients were examined .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from one through kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were placed on se@@ amed into the same degree as in those patients who continue to sustain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output level of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , steady mig@@ raine headaches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions to it . &quot;
&quot; the conclusion of the Committee for Human Immun@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union , the medicinal product has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company dedicated to Ab@@ se@@ amed is to provide medical personnel in all Member States of information , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
August 2007 the European Commission shared the company Medi@@ ce medicinal P@@ mothers GmbH &amp; Co KG to obtain a permit for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ignant ly@@ mph@@ omas or multi @-@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ om , which received chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general state ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) exists . &quot;

&quot; in patients with sudden action loss , defined as a reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be examined by re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te and the usual causes for a non @-@ failure ( ice @-@ acid , acid or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ mol@@ y@@ se ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ cytes ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; index ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ cytes and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ ten@@ te are determined and if no other reason of a drug should be found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ ani@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of sub@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ state @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with renal an@@ emia ) are not adequate .
&quot; 8 For patients with chronic kidney failure , in the section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target @-@ concentration should not be exceeded . &quot;
clinical studies were observed an increased risk of mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events when ery@@ thropo@@ genesis stimul@@ ant drugs ( ESA ) with a hem@@ og@@ wage @-@ concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have no significant benefits that can be attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased for the control of an@@ a@@ es@@ y@@ earning and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in the problem .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evi@@ dently coron@@ ary heart disease , or reservoir in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target @-@ concentration . &quot;
&quot; following the present findings by the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with renal in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of renal in@@ suffici@@ ency does not accelerated . &quot;
patients suffering should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who have to be transc@@ end@@ owed ) .
if the h@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) has to minimize the dose for possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ist an@@ emia - Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ ting with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ds should be based on the benefit of the patient &apos;s risk , which should also be taken into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; for patients , which are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the start of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go to a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can be found in patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl a rise of risk for post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , it has not been proven to improve the overall survival of tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or decrease the risk of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which was received for chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target range was pursued by 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied along with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels should be controlled by Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ osis should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ocr@@ ity . &quot;
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies on tum@@ our tissues there are no indications of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F related to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ thropo@@ ds .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ ami@@ tin @-@ treatment , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood@@ don@@ or and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; gene@@ tically found epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ cally and related to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate part identical to the endo@@ genous human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone body cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates the ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and not influences the Leu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ese .

survival and tum@@ ors have been studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ e@@ controlled studies and
there was no difference in the open study between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ ami@@ tin patients and the patients patients .
&quot; in these studies the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with a an@@ a@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ om@@ inations consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than with the controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ ami@@ tin patients and with checks .
&quot; there is an elevated risk for thro@@ mbo@@ genic events with tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ es , and a negative effect on the overall survival can not be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients , treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in under 13 g / dl , as few patients with these characteristics were included in the audi@@ ted data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life time of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections , the ser@@ um of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the serotonin level that can be achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no sorrow : the ser@@ um will remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mark@@ ary fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was the incidence of bone loss fibro@@ sis across the control group with Di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not increased with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • osteoporosis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menopause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone break@@ ings ) , including patients who have recently suffered a small trau@@ matic hats like when they have suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with lo@@ id Surgery should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) , or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; filing of Par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms associated in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be prescribed Ac@@ la@@ sta only by doctors who have experience in treating this ail@@ ment .
&quot; since the active substance in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material was used for Zom@@ eta for the evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with osteoporosis and the number of verteb@@ rates and hips were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study involved 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years , who recently suffered an im@@ mobili@@ zing job ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years . &quot;
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
&quot; main indication of the effectiveness was , whether the salary of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme , sealed bone substance ) in the blood once more norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the value . &quot;
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ ra@@ ines were reduced by patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other o@@ gly@@ otic drugs ) over a period of three years compared to the patients suffering from placebo by 70 % .
&quot; in comparison of all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ gly@@ otic drugs ) , with those under placebo the risk of hip replac@@ ements was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with custo@@ di@@ sta 9 % of patients suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients suffering from placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tions in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ la@@ sta can not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the ingredients .
&quot; as in all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate patients are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions at the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( deportation of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides an enlighten@@ ing material for doctors who are prescri@@ bing Ac@@ la@@ sta in the treatment of osteoporosis , the indication of how the medicine applies , as well as a similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor . &quot;

intraven@@ ous osteoporosis and osteoporosis is recommended for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta every year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic wizard , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after operating care ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ get Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic rec@@ ap@@ tion , an Initi@@ al dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. orange or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney distur@@ b@@ ance ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients alike is similar to younger . &quot;
&quot; children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 , since data is missing for in@@ consistency and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended in patients with severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as there are only limited clinical experience for these patient population . &quot;
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to treat calcium and vitamin D before the start of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of fast inser@@ ting the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be carried out before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental handles , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate is reduced the risk to oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the doctor &apos;s treatment should be the basis of the treatment plan of any patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of as a serious side effect reported cases of anticip@@ ation was increased in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the osteoporosis ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial Agreement &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall pre@@ valence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.2 % ) and placebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in chart 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney problems , which is expressed as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured in front of the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure and a clinical study function were similar to osteoporosis over three years compared to the Ac@@ counting and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory studies , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were found under the normal fluctu@@ ation sheet ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in a large clinical trial treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;
all patients received supple@@ mental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al osteoporosis , in the study for the prevention of clinical questionn@@ aires following a shell correction and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for the prevention of clinical questionn@@ aires , the vitamin D mirror was not measured routine , however , the majority of patients received an initi@@ ating dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw @-@ area occasionally became , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth contrac@@ tions or other dental attacks .

Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had an increased risk of 60 % decreased risk of verteb@@ rates ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an equally constant effect on three years , resulting in a by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for stro@@ llers . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly to all points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ular patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) . a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pelvic spon@@ ge .
a micro @-@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed that patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to placebo an increase in trans@@ forming bone @-@ volume and the preservation of the trans@@ forming bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the studio time .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the output and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
&quot; P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output @-@ value after 12 months , and was held at 52 % below the value for up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output level after 12 months , and was held at 55 % below the value for up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not measured in routine , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mort@@ ality was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta Group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total loss and cord at all times .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment carried out over 24 months compared to the placebo treatment for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in the total area and by 4.@@ 3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
&quot; clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized , 50@@ 8 men random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical questionn@@ aires in men ; the frequency of clinical questionn@@ aires was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , once again yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) was once again the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to the percentage of the lum@@ bar change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the starting point . &quot;
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years ago ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ 4.7 to 3.@@ 0@@ ples age @-@ specific upper Nor@@ mal in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the in@@ gestion of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six months studies .
the combined results was observed after 6 months by a similar decrease in pain strength and pain level in comparison to the value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified at the end of the six month study as a respon@@ sive report ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic address given to 141 of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients , to be kept in a middle duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bar took fast starting from &lt; 10 % of the maximum level after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of maximum value . &quot;
&quot; ras@@ ches bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic dis@@ appearing of the large cycle with half @-@ times goes ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ of 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ mination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ -@@ 14@@ 6 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early stages phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the given dose can be tied in the urine , while the rest is mostly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearing of cy@@ to@@ g@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ i metabolic substances is unlikely because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ lized by humans , and because it is not a direct and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly , metabolic in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and amo@@ unted to 64 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and amo@@ unted to 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
the result is that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney @-@ disorder up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; because of heavy renal distur@@ b@@ ance ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ia Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) limited data only , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and with R@@ atten 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the Au@@ c the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , admin@@ istered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ etic influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ e@@ ability of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats has been admin@@ istered in 3 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which is equivalent to the Au@@ c , which is equivalent to the Au@@ c , corresponds to the Au@@ c , corresponds to the Au@@ c , corresponds ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use of cum@@ ulative expos@@ ures , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injections . &quot;
&quot; clinical examination of studies with repeated use was a multip@@ lied primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ aphy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with virtually all doses , a fund that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
in rats one watched a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ity of doses from 0.@@ 2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) abnormalities and such of the skeleton .
&quot; rabbits were not observed in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or endom@@ etri@@ al effects , although the maternal toxic@@ ity at 0,1 mg / kg was formed as a result of humili@@ ating ser@@ um calcium . &quot;

&quot; Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a medium @-@ class , called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat osteoporosis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , osteoporosis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ estrogen which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is done quickly , and new bone material is built @-@ based , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by pressing the bone structure again norm@@ alized , thereby making a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or need any dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; applying Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , known by those that they may damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta , along with food and drinks , you should take enough fluid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ene .
&quot; if you have broken down the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after operating care of the ridge . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need another dose for a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly to that the calcium mirror in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may act Ac@@ la@@ sta longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you when you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was arranged immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
&quot; before ending the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta in case of termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( at more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have such symptoms if you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of one too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amping , or critical feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

&quot; more than allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( like swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if any of the listed effects can be considerably imp@@ aired or you may notice side effects which are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h is not exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently fin@@ alised low @-@ trau@@ matic Surgery , is recommended to carry the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after operating care of the hip surgery . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be adequately taken with fluid ; this is especially important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; because of fast inser@@ ting the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently ext@@ ingu@@ ished low @-@ trau@@ matic wizard will be recommended to a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. orange or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; in addition , four studies have been carried out to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to a placebo as a supportive means for setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; the studies on the setting of the smoking , however , showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to assess on this application area . &quot;

the Committee for Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the effectiveness of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA in terms of weight loss in patients with obesity or overweight people
medicines used for patients who need it from health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( by providing clearing packages for patients and doctors ) and around the Ar@@ z
it is due to di@@ eting diet and movement to treat a obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) that have beyond one or more risk factors such as type 2 @-@ 2 diabetes or Dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European public representative report ( EP@@ AR ) in which this study has been evaluated in order to access recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ account is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It may be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) can be applied together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ medication ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fa drugs or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fa drugs or insulin can be maintained with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should the dose of sul@@ fa drugs or insulin . &quot;
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar levels decl@@ ines which type 2 @-@ 2 diabetes can be set better .
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa drugs , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows the blood sugar levels to be reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ th@@ ic study , the effect of the additional gift of acet@@ yl@@ in and a sul@@ fa drugs demonstrated in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , investig@@ ating the combination of acet@@ tos and insulin at 2@@ 89 patients , the patients who participated in addition to insulin , a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects related to Ac@@ tos were tend@@ on , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ca@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis ( high ket@@ ones ) - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos as part of a mon@@ otherapy ( in sole use ) is to be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , for which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed . &quot;

&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , conve@@ x and wear on one side the mark &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin to patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and ede@@ ma if Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one with patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
patients with increased volume liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used in Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is increased to the 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit of the standard range , the liver disease values are as soon as possible to control again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient developed symptoms that indicate on a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , wa@@ iter @-@ degra@@ ding , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark har@@ n , are the liver disease values . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient continues with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be directed to the procedure of laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
clinical studies with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been proven to be a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain which can be derived from li@@ pos@@ u@@ ations and in some cases associated with fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ocr@@ acy ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative studies in patients with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ atom@@ a by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased insulin income in patients , the pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one or three @-@ combination combination therapy with a sul@@ fa drugs or three @-@ combination therapy with insulin is obtained , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the launch with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one , has been reported on a appearance or deterioration of diabe@@ tic m@@ acular ede@@ ma with a reduction in the tend@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but prohi@@ bit doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , if patients report on interference of the tend@@ ons ; an appropriate ophthal@@ m@@ ological declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events in random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
the calculated frei@@ ghter incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with the patients treated with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 questionn@@ aires per 100 patients @-@ years with women who were treated with a comparison .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , occurred questionn@@ aires at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patients ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patients ) in patients treated with a comparison . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dealt with ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ o@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ lized from these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ tions are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the Au@@ c of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one for the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one with rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the Au@@ c of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this can be attributed to that under treatment with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one which decreases in pregnancy the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s pregnancy and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( out of these data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in Tur@@ g@@ or and Bre@@ n inde@@ xes the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on occurred AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents on the triple of the upper limit of the standard range , frequently referred to as under placebo but less common than in comparison @-@ groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa drugs . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of severe heart failure in Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch of market , it has rarely been reported on heart failure in Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , more often if Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages unwanted events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with compar@@ isons treated groups . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires appeared at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison . &quot;
&quot; by taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , after 180 mg / day more than seven days , no symptoms occurred . &quot;
pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to function over an activation of specific core receptors ( P@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor ) ) which leads in the animal model to increased insulin sensi@@ tivities of liver , fat and skeleton cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose in the liver and boo@@ sts the peripher@@ al glucose in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ icide as mon@@ otherapy was carried out over two years to investigate the time until the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ icide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ e@@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were inadequate despite three @-@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optim@@ isation phase with insulin was inadequate , into pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to receive only insulin ; a reduction in insulin is observed in the group with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one group . &quot;
clinical trials over a year showed itself under Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one cat@@ chy a statisti@@ cally significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ental ) was tested in a small group on 18 weeks of examination of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials when compared to placebo a reduction in the plasma tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ ol levels as well as sli@@ ght@@ less but clinically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years @-@ reduced Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide the total plas@@ ticity gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ ol levels . &quot;
compared to placebo has been found under Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ icide decreased values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on is not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des levels , both on an effect on tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the hepati@@ c tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups random@@ ized over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti @-@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ted , with the leading concentration of un@@ altered pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reaches 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; this base reflects the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in about the tri@@ ples of the effectiveness of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; studies could be proven that Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ o@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mar@@ ker was mainly found in decay ( 55 % ) and a lower scale in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the middle plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ changing Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one is approximately 5 @-@ 6 hours and all of the active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma @-@ zentr@@ ations of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy prob@@ es , although the instal@@ ments of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance is similar . &quot;
&quot; in to@@ xi@@ c@@ ological studies occurred on mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration , Plas@@ ma@@ volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this can be attributed to that under treatment with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one which decreases in the creation of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s population and thus reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) at the rat increased In@@ zi@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the urinary epitheli@@ um .
in a animal model of the famili@@ ari@@ om@@ at@@ ous pol@@ yp@@ osis ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of colon@@ tum@@ ors .

in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ icide were examined .
clinical studies about 1 year showed itself under Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one cat@@ chy a statisti@@ cally significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to the output values .

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e has been tested in total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to utilize insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar to a different human race . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be applied to patients who might possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human beings ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ap@@ han@@ e must be adjusted , if it is admin@@ istered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the package of pack@@ aged ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human Immun@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e were reported in the treatment of diabetes in relation to the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission shared a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S ) for the expansion of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e throughout the European Union . &quot;
mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily when a rapid initi@@ alizing effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
injection no@@ bility must be used at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the total dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ war@@ n@@ symptoms can be altered and should be advised . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( quickly acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human or insulin method ) can cause a change in dosage required . &quot;
&quot; if switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e is required in the patient a dosage adjustment , this may be necessary for the first dosage , or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occur after a change of animal based on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia were less pronounced or different from the previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before traveling , who go beyond several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips may result in that insulin and meals should be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and follow its patients as a result of these drugs .

&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted , when it is admin@@ istered along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission shared a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the expansion of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide throughout the European Union .
&quot; if two types of insulin are being mixed , first the quantity of insulin must be re@@ trac@@ ed , then the amount of insulin will then be transformed . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients who have already identified signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain , and inflammation in the joints ) or poison notes ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; ) , that may lead to joint and bone damage . &quot;
&quot; when the urinary tract comes after two to four weeks still over 6 mg per December , the dose can be increased once every day ( 120 mg once daily ) . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment of treatment , still Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ cies can occur ; therefore , patients are recommended at least during the first six months under treatment with ad@@ ur@@ ic even more medicinal products for prevention of poison . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had a transplan@@ tation since it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness tri@@ mm@@ ers of different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to a placebo ( hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hypertension ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; main indication of the effectiveness was the number of patients , whose urinary tract was found in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients having once daily 120 mg once daily in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
especially in patients with cardiac abnormalities in the pre@@ history may also be an elevated risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the Committee for Human veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the urinary tract , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to ur@@ passed deposits ( including any of the history known or current present , and / or a g@@ ou@@ ty arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the server turns after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dose of dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe renal function , the effectiveness and safety were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ia Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people therefore have no experience with children and young people , the application of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at will not be recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; for instance , Organ@@ izer was not recommended by Organ@@ iz@@ ations , the application of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; cardiovascular disease With patients with isch@@ a@@ mic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; like with other har@@ n@@ ous drugs , it can occur during the treatment of treatment to an acute poison @-@ attack , because it can be mobili@@ zed by reducing the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing deposits in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ignant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine tend to rise so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed slight abnormalities of the liver values in with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; it is therefore recommended to perform a liver functional prior to the beginning of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment , and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ was were not conducted in exchange studies at Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhibit@@ ing of the met@@ abol@@ ism of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ shirt ) .
&quot; the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with a rise in Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , Au@@ c 41 % and T1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;

pregnancy data on a very limited number of ex@@ pon@@ ed pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be close to side effects of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of fet@@ us / newborn .
&quot; experimental studies cannot be restricted to direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities , until they can be assured that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has not been fully influenced by their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the exam@@ inations reported in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patients ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1,4 and 0.3 events per 100 patients ) were found no statisti@@ cally significant connection with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at phase III .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ clerosis of the disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ attack or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects resulting in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which ( test assessment ) were reported in a total of more than once , are listed below . &quot;

the events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to which were reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in all Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg / 120 mg in long@@ time renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an ex@@ position of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in the Pi@@ vot@@ al studies of the Phase 3 for these doses either not at all or with a lower frequency :

the AP@@ EX study showed a significant significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a significant significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg daily .

&quot; the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 , and permanently retained over the entire treatment . &quot;
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ment &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with renal functional inf@@ rin@@ gement The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with renal glands ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
there were no clinically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the serv@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ants in prob@@ es regardless of their renal function ( 58 % in the group with normal renal function and 55 % in the group with severe renal dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had taken 30 % of the patients ( Bas@@ eline ) a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ascent of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open renewal study period 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serv@@ o @-@ secular level occurs on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease in the incidence of g@@ ural attacks ( i.e. , more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ g@@ love ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the poison size , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the Gi@@ cht@@ k@@ notes from month 24 to a result . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ m / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; with healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plas@@ ular concentration time curve ( Au@@ c ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration is easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , a rise in the Au@@ c is observed , larger than the dos@@ is@@ al increase . &quot;
after in@@ gestion simpler or multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 : 3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clinically significant changes in percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ di@@ cent@@ ation was observed if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady section of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 65 % ( primary bond of Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration width that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies with human liver micro@@ summ@@ ers showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id will primarily be created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose found in the urine as an un@@ altered Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its Con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat osteoporosis ( a condition where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menopause in which a risk consists of a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin pills ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; da Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company put data from earlier studies and the published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with osteoporosis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data in front of the fact that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose is exactly the dose that is required to prevent a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ iness ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ ols ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ ols ) , ul@@ cer@@ eal , mal@@ nour@@ ished abdom@@ en ( bo@@ iled belly ) , as well as su@@ ck up . &quot;
patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , Vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients may not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calorie level ) or in patients who cannot sit upright or sit on at least 30 minutes . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin pills ) for the day . &quot;
&quot; the following references are to be followed , in order to reduce the risk of ös@@ opha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) : &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed following the day after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cut down the tablet or the tablet in the mouth . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ opha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ opha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ opha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by ös@@ opha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ k@@ els , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partially these severe and required ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore carefully consider to all signs and symptoms that point to possible ös@@ opha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in the appearance of symptoms ös@@ opha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ yst@@ al pain or new or self ag@@ grav@@ ate heart@@ burn using the medicinal product ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe ös@@ opha@@ ge@@ al side effects seem to be increased in patients who do not take the drug correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms , which indicate to a highly @-@ opha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all doses to be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large scale clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk has been found , many severe ( after launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ astro of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment ime predominantly intraven@@ ously admin@@ istered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the dra@@ fting of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a jaw surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ros@@ is of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the prescri@@ bing doctor is crucial for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk .
patients should be dependent on the failure of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed its failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking a tablet every week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
&quot; other diseases , which affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) , should also be treated at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some or@@ ale drugs may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ action studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without having clinically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy or breastfeeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not give an indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ astro of the jaw was reported in patients suffering under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , but most reports have been published by cancer patients , but was also reported in o@@ il@@ otic patients . &quot;

studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate The therapeutic equality of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate once a weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) was proven in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with osteoporosis .
the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and questionn@@ aires at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the questionnaire study ( FIT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies the middle climb@@ s of BM@@ D with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years of 8.@@ 8 % in the spinal column : 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7,8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate group a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 3.@@ 2 % compared to placebo 6.@@ 2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffering one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continues to be ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ controlled studies where al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate daily ( 5 mg every day and then 10 mg daily continues to be taken daily by either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study we reduced the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate the occurrence of at least a new fra@@ gment by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 7.9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
Res@@ or@@ ption related to a intraven@@ ous reference rate was the middle or@@ ginal bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before taking a standard breakfast . &quot;
the bio@@ availability took up to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers the gift of or@@ derly pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) is not a clinically relevant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the average of 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats has revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is divided according to intraven@@ ous volume of 1 mg / kg , but then spread rapidly into the bone or eliminated with urine . &quot;
&quot; the intraven@@ ous volume of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate were found around 50 % of the radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with urine , and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects . &quot;
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous , a single dose of 10 mg was the ren@@ e@@ ish Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance over 200 ml / min . &quot;
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by rats or alkal@@ ine transportation system in the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion When offering radio@@ active vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity was 4.@@ 4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the share of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not exp@@ elled in the bone , rapidly eliminated in the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there is no clinical data above it , however , it is to be reck@@ oned that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal @-@ attempt will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore patients with reduced kidney function may be expected to be expected for patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is given adult patients admin@@ istered to which a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a def@@ ying of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft have already been deployed in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously published studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data published in the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vaginal et with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients where the transplan@@ ts has been rep@@ elled after a period of one year ( for example examined how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and investig@@ ates how Ad@@ vag@@ raf compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thromycin ) , or any of the ingredients may not be applied to Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf because the Ad@@ vaginal dose or the dose of the same drug may need to be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients , this medicine should re@@ arrange or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or increased incidence of side effects , including sub @-@ or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ ul@@ ant control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant experienced physician ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment should be performed to make sure the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in the individual case and on blood @-@ reflection ( see below )
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure to be measured as a talent level , compared with both form@@ ulations both during kidney and le@@ ased patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure proper substance exposure to immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with a low Clear@@ ance , a adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ chem@@ e can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate are introduced to the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the use of the transp@@ l@@ ent repression of the transp@@ l@@ ent powers , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ign@@ ation must be prolonged ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - renal transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ actic therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
other dosage adap@@ tations can be later required since the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient according to the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ ous ad@@ renal therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommended for conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a transp@@ l@@ ent dose of two daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal raf , so has this conversion in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion of other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily the treatment has to start with each in kidney or liver transplan@@ tation recommended oral initi@@ ates for prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tion .
heart transp@@ l@@ ant At adult patients who are invited to Ad@@ vag@@ raf is an oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning .
&quot; other Tran@@ scription receiver , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and al transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initi@@ alization dose of 0.@@ 2 mg / kg / day , and at intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ alization of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dos@@ ages in special patient groups patient with reduced liver function for maintenance of blood @-@ mirror in the desired area may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions as a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function As the renal function is not an influence on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , it is recommended to a careful monitoring of the renal function ( including a regular determination of the serotonin level , a calculation of the circle @-@ inc@@ ance and monitoring of the ure@@ volume ) . &quot;
shifting from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ridge on a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is caution ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the talent level in full blue The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in the individual case of full @-@ bl@@ ut tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level during the first two weeks to transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dosage adjustment , changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or the current application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments for the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials can be concluded that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the talent level in the blood should not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the talent of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be found in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with - and sav@@ ated patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and heart transp@@ orts were usually used in blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
this has led to severe unwanted events including transplan@@ tation or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus shelter or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ masch@@ ant control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transp@@ l@@ ent cuts , which has been proven against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants as therapy @-@ resistant , are not yet a clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
for prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tion in adult heart transp@@ l@@ ors and transplan@@ tations in the child &apos;s age are not yet clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded wording Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
&quot; due to possible interactions formed in the blood and a de@@ preci@@ ation of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ riculum ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) , or other herbal medicines will avoid during treatment with adjuv@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle concentrations in the blood because the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations .
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f it was a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy called chamber or sep@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid transfer and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients suffering the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for practices such as headaches , changed levels of consciousness , cr@@ amping and visual defects , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hard@@ capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is provided in patients with the rare heredit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus reduce blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ foam blood levels can change from the current gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain constant concentrations ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction has been developed with antim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole , and with the Macro@@ lid @-@ antibiotic ery@@ thromycin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z . &quot;
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly consists of the increased organic bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ do@@ si@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute waste reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ lized , whose metabolism is imp@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can put down the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , and thus increase the hormone position , is particularly careful with decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of veterin@@ try have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not notice that among Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants is an elevated risk for unwanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the newborn can be found on any kind of harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the low @-@ acting profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants often can be seen because of the underlying medical condition of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are the adverse effects listed according to their frequency in desc@@ ending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ soluble and high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plas@@ map@@ le , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ zable . &quot;
drug and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be conve@@ yed by a cy@@ tos@@ tic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the expansion of the connection in the cellular inner .

Adv@@ ates will be used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ or@@ hi@@ lie A ( one by the lack of factor VIII related , inn@@ ate blood stream disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application will focus on whether Adv@@ anc@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding from surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ at@@ hi@@ lie A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood@@ stream problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it facilit@@ ates to the formation of the human being . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar in the European Union for approved drugs called Recom@@ men@@ ate , but it is different , so that the medicine does not contain proteins , human@@ oid or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to medium @-@ severe hem@@ or@@ hi@@ lie A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical intervention . &quot;
&quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ entures in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ iso@@ iso@@ den has been awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; well &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies towards factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Christmas must not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human body factor VIII , Maus@@ or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the ingredients . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission shared a permit for the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG for the marketing of Adv@@ antage in the European Union .
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy set up after the severity of the factor VIII @-@ defect , according to the location and extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following ha@@ em@@ ian events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the indicated plasma bar ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) will repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over for patients .
&quot; during the treatment , it is recommended for controlling the dose to be admin@@ istered dose and the frequency of injections a reasonable determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma bar . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half times . &quot;
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ or@@ hi@@ lie A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. of factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities can not be reached or if the bleeding is controlled with a reasonable dosage , a test must be performed to im@@ itate an inhibitors . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be taken . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; date &quot; &quot; speed should be addressed after the patient &apos;s management , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ or@@ hi@@ lie A .
these inhibitors are always opposed to pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ational activity by factor VIII and Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say in Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibitors to develop cor@@ relation with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 consecutive days depends on the largest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product , has been observed to another , the res@@ ign@@ ation of ( lower ) inhibitors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the hem@@ or@@ hi@@ lie A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s largest number of patients were inf@@ used against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) which all occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibitors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting has been maintained throughout time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .

&quot; in addition , there was none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed more severe to medium @-@ severe hem@@ or@@ hi@@ lie A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) to a F@@ VIII In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
in previously untreated patients of a current clinical study formed 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients in inhibitors to factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins has been analyzed by exam@@ ining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward movement as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell , otherwise there occurred no signs or symptoms that occurred on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported on the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated products as part of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first @-@ present data , the CH@@ MP has the benefit of risk @-@ risk reduction , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that its approval has to apply for another renewal procedure in five years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announces the Committee for Human Immun@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes his request to approval for the upgrade from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .

it is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified in such a gene that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and can cause no infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been spra@@ yed directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA can not be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein works properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study with a patient before , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bone and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions posed , still some questions were un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP issued a day to 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors will take advantage of the patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in reliable ways and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient to be harmful . &quot;
the Company does not put the CH@@ MP any of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compound Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered active constitu@@ ent &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective ingredients immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) in patients with nas@@ al endom@@ etri@@ al ( pet@@ ri@@ ly nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adol@@ escents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily for a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al endom@@ etri@@ um ( pet@@ ri@@ ly nose ) . &quot;
a treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be re@@ sti@@ p@@ ated on the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main focus were the changes in the s@@ lugg@@ ish@@ ness of the hay@@ fever symptom that were reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study the patients wor@@ e their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary , and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all the hay@@ fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze took over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients , the pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al endom@@ etri@@ um was considered , patients under the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took the disaster in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart infection ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis ( stimul@@ i ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ an@@ gled membrane ( hypertension ) , hypertension or vascular diseases ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ self ( hyper@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have a risk for a ha@@ unting stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is a whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without breaking , break or che@@ wing ) . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years because of the mis@@ conception of data on the uncertainty and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued following any of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of time to 10 days , since the use of long @-@ term application can take up the activity of pseudo @-@ he@@ dr@@ ine at the time . &quot;
&quot; after the decline of the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ m in the upper respiratory system , the treatment may be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors , such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , per@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ vo@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ Phr@@ ine , E@@ phe@@ as@@ oline , Nap@@ ol@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the security and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s ol@@ lec@@ tic , and the data is not sufficient to address the recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
security and effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data is not sufficient to add appropriate recommendations to dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment in appearance of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or reinfor@@ cement of headaches ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients suffer from digit@@ alis • patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , patients with hypertension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ attack in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka will otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin actions or reduce it to its extent . &quot;
&quot; clinical tests with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , which ery@@ thromycin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been admin@@ istered in addition , however , no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plas@@ mas@@ con@@ centr@@ ation are observed by dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing , no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with a dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether or dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol . &quot;
it has not been identified for the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . it has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
&quot; dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibitors of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
the un@@ think@@ able of the use of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to have experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies but no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
&quot; because Re@@ production studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans , and due to the vascular properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed about that in very rare cases , it may occur in very rare cases to imp@@ air traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ m@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; headaches , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ating mi@@ tig@@ ating , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pain , vom@@ iting , pain , vom@@ iting , pain , ag@@ ulation , tend@@ on and hypertension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially probable in children , as well as A@@ trop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ ier , pun@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ net , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the ad@@ renal molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dose of adults with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement using the flight capacity , including the reinfor@@ cement of subjective counter@@ parts or the tasks connected to flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg , no increased incidence of r@@ ami@@ ties compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further aff@@ om@@ int@@ e@@ tical effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1.@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , where 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine efficacy of the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ ell@@ itus effect , determined by the nose @-@ loop , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single case study at the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is proven within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; according to the per@@ or@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze near healthy prob@@ es over 14 days , the fly @-@ weight of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in and Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic Multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult tests , has been noted that four subjects of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in poorly changed . &quot;
a component Inter@@ action study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to a aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ as@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , to genom@@ ic@@ ity and to Re@@ production of reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data can be recognized by dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in however no special dangers for man . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ physiological studies the combination of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbit in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .

&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at to rede@@ em ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg m@@ elt tablets ( tablets that can dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ ting . &quot;
for children aged one to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ w .
&quot; for children aged 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by placing the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the p@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and the performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; other studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body controls the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and furn@@ aces in the same way as the tablets and use in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; allergic rh@@ initi@@ s caused when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg as@@ eri@@ us have to be increased from 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decline of symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission shared a permit for the distribution of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are limited experience of clinical studies on efficacy in the application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ balls in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease and can be completed after the end of the symptoms and will be resum@@ ed with their resum@@ ption .
&quot; in the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergy @-@ time treatment . &quot;
clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets in which ery@@ thromycin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , with the simultaneous effect of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ quality effect of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed about that in very rare cases , it may occur in very rare cases to imp@@ air traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more unwanted effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
the most commonly used adverse effects which were reported more often than in placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect headaches , these occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and with 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which have been admin@@ istered up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adjuv@@ ant cells . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multi@@ plying in which the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was admin@@ istered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily by 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of clinical dose ) was admin@@ istered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; at a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg , no influence on standard measurement sizes including the reinfor@@ cement of subjective counter@@ parts or the tasks connected to flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , trac@@ ts and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be classified depending on the duration of symptoms , or even in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the full scores of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ up@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the allergic reaction to sa@@ vory allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was investigated for further forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria since the underlying path@@ ge@@ ology irrespective of the e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be a simple pro@@ spec@@ tiv .
&quot; since the hist@@ amine is a cur@@ ative factor in all ancest@@ ral diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine will also lead to an improvement of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose of dosage .
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the mu@@ c@@ una has been observed by more than 50 % of patients with a dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax , as was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients compared with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , was achieved by 4 % of patients a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ach@@ in . &quot;
there is no clue to a clinically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
it has not yet been identified for the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . it has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs is not entirely excluded .
dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibitors of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty food , low @-@ calorie breakfast ) does not affect the availability of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ balls . &quot;
&quot; the study conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed pre@@ clinical trials , in a comparable degree of exposure of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , not qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity film of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ as@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeti@@ tive gift , geni@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ x@@ ic@@ ity leave the prec@@ lin@@ ical data of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no particular dangers for man . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals for allevi@@ ating the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bers should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s can be caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is used to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections , or anatom@@ ical abnormalities should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory tests . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic dis@@ lor@@ ries are restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ cy ( see below 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted to metabolic , is identical to those in children who are normal metabolic . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ absor@@ bing absorption , or a su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine not . &quot;
clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thromycin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been given ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the high @-@ quality effect of alcohol are not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the total loss of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and adol@@ escents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more unwanted effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an additional dose of adults and adol@@ escents , who have been admin@@ istered up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine in question , received a daily disaster dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ines in adults and children can be compens@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population .
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multiple adults and adol@@ escents , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied more than 14 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , was not statisti@@ cally significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ escents , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of clinical dose ) over ten days in adults showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents , no increased incidence of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
in a single @-@ day @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg at adults and adol@@ escents in clinical trials are not imp@@ aired psych@@ omot@@ ors .
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , it was not affected by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced performance . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in allevi@@ ating the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , trac@@ ts and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the full scores of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ up@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effectively caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose of dosage .
&quot; the spread of this fully metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ ru@@ sion of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the load ( Au@@ c ) by dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ 74 higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal price of about 120 hours .
there is no clue to a clinically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; after receiving the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; bodily virus &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; due to this , the immune system is later able to form in contact with a influenza virus this st@@ am@@ ms faster . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the virus type of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , separated by the human body as the body @-@ alien ) , and used as a part of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this results from clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; for further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , amo@@ is may be taken as a solution to the one , but it cannot be taken together with k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ a should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which anti@@ viral medicines used before has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood has judged that the virus will address the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily working together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of o@@ gener@@ ase is based upon the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , the HIV amount is reduced in the blood and keeps it on a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS not to heal , but can also delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase has been treated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously did not have been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
that with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine o@@ gener@@ ase was taken by 20@@ 6 adults who had used earlier prot@@ eas@@ ers with other prot@@ eas@@ ers inhibitors .
main indication of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies involving patients who had previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ers after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients suffering a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the Vir@@ us@@ last but with the children who previously had been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , very few on the treatment . &quot;
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ers that have been treated earlier with prot@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ers :
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was res@@ istent against four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in the patients who took up their previous prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of o@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ id@@ avi@@ r or any of the ingredients .
&quot; gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients being used , the cur@@ riculum ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines which are as low as ag@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , in patients suffering , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( decrease of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ otherap@@ ist ( symptoms of an infection caused by the recovery of the immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human Immun@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants have been treated with HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years opposite the risks .
&quot; gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Cau@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ers or is not proven . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information is available . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group Limited permit a permit for the expansion of A@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ ers ( PI ) treatment @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase are to be admin@@ istered capsules for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ stery of amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ avi@@ r should take place at the consideration of the individual viral Res@@ ist@@ enz@@ mu@@ sters and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than am@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg am@@ r twice daily in combination with 100 mg chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied capsules without the ampli@@ fying additive of k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) must be applied higher doses of axi@@ as ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of o@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ eas@@ ers were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; ag@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ conception of data to ir@@ regul@@ arity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ological data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate @-@ wei@@ ghty liver disorder on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be made with caution in patients with slight or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a limited therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates des Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; herbal preparations , the cur@@ riculum ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) contain , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not result in cure the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ag@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules are to be used in combination with low doses of k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver effects associated with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous antibiotic treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of gener@@ ase and chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ one or other glucose concentrations , which is confused about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , including mor@@ ing C@@ ushing and supple@@ mentation by the renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the processing of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibitors and sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended as a simultaneous arrest of A@@ gener@@ acy with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ es@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; 4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ alization R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the concentration concentration . &quot;
&quot; for patients who use these medicines simultaneously , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of decreased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ r of amp@@ hibi@@ an , less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ ium symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ ca@@ col@@ ts of the axi@@ al solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase should be set up for a duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ ity is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ers , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia or an ex@@ ergy of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors , such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ exag@@ onal patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cur@@ ators and hem@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective patients ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infection , leading to severe clinical symptoms or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial e@@ ti@@ ology is believed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune @-@ measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates des Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with drugs that are mainly confused about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plas@@ m@@ ots with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resource development .
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate the lower plasma bar through a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibitors , in combination with k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r , were very often observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
cur@@ riculum ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The ser@@ um levels of amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
&quot; if a patient already enters a cur@@ few , the am@@ id@@ ine level are avi@@ r@@ ently and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and to reset the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max against 30 % if chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with am@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
clinical studies have been applied doses of 600 mg am@@ f@@ avi@@ r twice daily and k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this treatment schem@@ atics .
52 % decreased if Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is admin@@ istered in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) , are given approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , but it will be a close machine surveillance , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; it has not been carried out by a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study for the application of gener@@ a in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the imagin@@ able component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z is required in combination with am@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ avi@@ r@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
the effects of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ eas@@ ers inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may possibly desc@@ end the Ser@@ um@@ con@@ centric of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used simultaneously , be careful since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , be@@ ware is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logic monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ avi@@ r and k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma @-@ concentration ( Au@@ c ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in conjunction with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin associated side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage given by ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic studies with ag@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thromycin were not performed but could be increased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are connected to these drugs when used in combination with ag@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as ag@@ gener@@ ase as it can lead to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ gar drugs that are known as en@@ du@@ el ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , carb@@ amaz@@ r ) , with Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of plasma bar . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ pine , pine @-@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased from 10 by am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of o@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibitors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , tend@@ on and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % sag@@ ank ( 90 % -@@ total interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently the simultaneous gift of gener@@ a are not recommended along with these glucose co@@ stero@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibitors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , which is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced cre@@ ws of plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing to expect from A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; because plasma fl@@ aming increases with this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibitors to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ ino oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended using am@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror since the plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ amy@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased from the current gift of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral @-@ recorded mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while having to be careful with par@@ enter@@ ale mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ ic mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ers point to a possible increase in plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing from Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am to 3@@ - to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is admin@@ istered along with Am@@ alek@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium @-@ cat@@ ch@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the reliability of the historical ver@@ ti@@ bility of historical ver@@ tices , there can be no recommendation to adapt as the amy@@ r@@ avi@@ r dose is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; while current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or reinfor@@ cement of anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not pre@@ dict@@ ably , therefore also alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous gift of ag@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine must be applied only after careful weighing of possible usefulness for the mother in comparison with possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; am@@ using rats has been proven in the milk ca@@ vi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known if Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r is transferred with people to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive @-@ production study at the uter@@ us rats , which was admin@@ istered by the natives in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during night@@ time . &quot;
the further development of descendants including fer@@ til@@ ty and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the uncertainty of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate that occurred very early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the listed side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which Prot@@ eas@@ ers have not been treated twice daily with Prot@@ eas@@ ers patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were presented by exam@@ inations as in connection with study communication , and with more than 1 % of the patients played , as well as under the treatment performed laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fa@@ int@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ oral and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue ( stit@@ ches ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral has not been treated with am@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine in combination of 36 weeks , was only a case ( stit@@ ches ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 2@@ 45 NR@@ TI@@ - treated patients with 24@@ 1 patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s over a period of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were normally slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ öser or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred within two weeks , without having to be can@@ cel@@ ed with am@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were specifically reported in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective patients ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of gener@@ ase twice daily with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were similar ; an exception formed increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d and CP@@ K values which received in patients suffering from low doses along with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose the patient is to observe on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , are necessary supportive measures . &quot;

&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected mol@@ ten cell@@ lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % in@@ fusion ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells
the connection between the activity of amy@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were rarely observed with prot@@ eas@@ e@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretations systems to analyze the results of Res@@ ist@@ enz@@ Assessment . &quot;
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic acid test @-@ based analyses Klin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies who sell diagnostic tests tests have developed clinically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a res@@ ist@@ ency .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ using avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cru@@ ising resistance against chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r will remain in general . &quot;
there are currently data for cross resistance between amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Res@@ ist@@ enz@@ in@@ ade - either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral vir@@ gin@@ r not pre@@ treated patients with whom an Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ulates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ults ) , sa@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ults ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ults ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isolation ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isolation ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isolation ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isolation ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isolation ) and ti@@ ch@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isolation ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations into the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early @-@ term departure of a ver@@ aging therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized study , in which with PI @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side ( standard of care , so@@ C ) , and nucle@@ o@@ gly@@ ca@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a hundred tri@@ und@@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity towards A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ discrimination of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ shelter threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ brid@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 had been treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution has been tested and capsules daily in doses of 15 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI treatment had previously given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ ments to this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children of the &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; &quot; ag@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max against 30 % if chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; administration of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the Au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ avi@@ r 12 hours ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; hence , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is affected and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ inhi@@ bited penetration from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of turbulent am@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part of the active ingredient , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration remains constant , fluctu@@ ates by percentage of free active ingredients during the period of free active ingredients in the Ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ strate from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given with caution when they are given at the same time with a gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ avi@@ r is made up of the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ ta@@ g@@ able than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and ag@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable .
&quot; also the ren@@ e@@ ish Clear@@ ance of k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the effect of a renal disorder may be low in the elimination of am@@ avi@@ r and k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ using avi@@ r plasma mir@@ rors comparable to those that may be achieved on healthy prob@@ es according to a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous submission of k@@ ern@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ cer@@ ation with amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ches he@@ pat@@ o@@ cellular aden@@ ome at dos@@ ages , which spoke after the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ cellular ine@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas have not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; these findings on people , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however have little evidence of adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial and mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ ut to rats and chromos@@ ome sha@@ ded to human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was am@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver disease can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring , AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , clinical studies have been observed yet no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor by the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both in the control and the animals treated with amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma position , which was significantly below ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage when men were , however , have observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus , and small skeleton changes that indicate an delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied capsules without the ampli@@ fying additive of k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) , higher doses must be applied to axi@@ as ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be made with caution in patients with weak or light liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ alization R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the concentration concentration . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase should be set up on a duration of 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ ity is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an elevated risk for a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resource development .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max against 30 % if chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with am@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) , are given approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , but it will be a close machine surveillance , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ avi@@ r@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , be@@ ware is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logic monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ avi@@ r and k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose will get 31 , although there are no clinical data in this case . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ pine , pine @-@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % sag@@ ank ( 90 % -@@ total interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or reinfor@@ cement of anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ rone ) led to a decrease in Au@@ c and C@@ min from Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied after careful weighing of possible usefulness for the mother in comparison with possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive @-@ production study at the uter@@ us rats , which was admin@@ istered by the natives in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the weight of the body weight . &quot;
the uncertainty of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose the patient is to observe on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , are necessary supportive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected mol@@ ten cell@@ lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % in@@ fusion ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations into the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , it should be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; &quot; gener@@ ase @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration remains constant , fluctu@@ ates from the percentage of free active ingredients during the period of free active ingredients in the Ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ strate from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given with caution when they are given at the same time with a gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ e@@ ish Clear@@ ance of k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore the effect of a renal disorder may be low in the elimination of am@@ avi@@ r and k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ cer@@ ation with amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ches he@@ pat@@ o@@ cellular aden@@ ome in dos@@ ages that spoke after the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fol@@ d@@ avi@@ r ( rat ) of 1200 mg am@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ cel@@ es aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ omas were not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present investigation data on people , both clinical trials and therapeutic application , there are little evidence of adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial and mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ ut to rats and chromos@@ ome control of human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was am@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both in the control and the animals treated with amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r treated animals . &quot;
&quot; these results can be concluded that in juven@@ iles the met@@ abolic paths are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ eas@@ ant adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the benefits of using k@@ nu@@ is@@ avi@@ r &quot; am@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was not taken neither with PI prior @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % less than am@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should take as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to the one ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ si@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dosage recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patient groups will be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ using is not necessary for am@@ using is an application of a generic solution to take in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ ph@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , an overall solution for children and children under 4 years , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous arrest can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabol@@ ites of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not result in cure the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ag@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 a transfer from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ alization R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the concentration concentration . &quot;
&quot; generic Rem@@ o@@ ase should be set on a long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ ity is involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an elevated risk for a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical , 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ exag@@ onal patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cur@@ ators and hem@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
it has been shown that rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resource development .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max against 30 % if chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with am@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; simultaneous use of o@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and lead to PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibitors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , tend@@ on and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibitors to the significantly higher plasma @-@ zentr@@ ations of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . axi@@ ally solution for inser@@ ting may be used due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ ene prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; am@@ using rats has been proven in the milk ca@@ vi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known if Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r is transferred with people to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive @-@ production study at the uter@@ us rats , which was admin@@ istered by the natives in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during night@@ time . &quot;
the uncertainty of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were rarely observed with prot@@ eas@@ e@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
the early departure of a dec@@ aying 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment .

your doctor will normally assign you to use A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on your doctor for you carried out by your doctor for you and based on your medical treatment history .
inform your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above diseases or any of the above drugs .
&quot; if your doctor recommended that you will take A@@ generic capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ ter@@ avi@@ r to reinforce the effect ( Boo@@ stery ) , make sure you &apos;ve read carefully before the start of treatment the usage information about k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; similarly , no sufficient information is available to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with k@@ mon@@ avi@@ r to efficiency with children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is important that you can read the section &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; before taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; may you need additional factor VIII in order to control the bleeding incl@@ ine . − In patients suffering an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot;

&quot; the applic@@ ability and the duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease treatment is al@@ dar@@ a up to a maximum of 16 weeks each week . • With small bas@@ al cell cycles , it is weekly during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; the cream is dil@@ uted before bed@@ time th@@ inning down on the affected skin areas , so it leaves sufficient long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ pants .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area was the complete healing rate in all four main studies 15 % to 52 % associated with al@@ dar@@ a patients treated with placebo patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clinically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic otic , not hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ pants ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p on immun@@ otherap@@ ist adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ sted or less suitable . &quot;

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible clut@@ ches have disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ al area or up to 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the above treatment should be assessed if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) or when the treatment area is observed an infection .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment of treatment the treated lesi@@ ons are only in@@ completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose is left , the patient applied the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is available in a thin layer and to put in the puri@@ fied , with fat war@@ ts in the skin area until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
&quot; it should take a decrease in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible failure of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
it should be a decrease in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rep@@ ulsion or Gra@@ ft @-@ Host@@ - reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ en@@ arity was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mos@@ is were observed and a case with a circumcision &apos;s leading r@@ res@@ h@@ aping . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there are increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation observed , which caused a treatment and / or lead to temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty with ur@@ inating , which required a emergency cath@@ eter@@ ization and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , immediately after a treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods used to treat out@@ war@@ ts in genital war@@ ts in the genital area and peripher@@ al areas have so far been no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest to a increased rate of influenza reduc@@ tions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in this patient group , however , has been shown a lesser degree . &quot;
&quot; cancer treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ id , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local Hau@@ tre@@ ach@@ ments are common but the intensity of these reactions are generally taken during therapy or the reactions are after the completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the severity of local hood , treatment may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed after the re@@ plen@@ ishment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , should consider other suitable therapy forms for treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients with relap@@ sed and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs do not lie clinical experience , so the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; data from an open clinical study point out that in big tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ pants on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip @-@ style . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ pants in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application for purposes , so this kind of application is not recommended . &quot;
local Hau@@ tre@@ ach@@ ments often occur but these reactions normally take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local government actions are great discomfort or very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acts as a result of less than 8 lesi@@ ons are reported for patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;

&quot; although there were neither after one @-@ mal@@ ignant application of quantitative application ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly known and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection @-@ related unwanted side effects in the studies involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 2@@ 8.1 % .

the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients cannot be recommended for any dosage schedule .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients treated patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions which are defined as any related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the In@@ fusion Day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , particularly these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ational devices are immediately available for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , it is expected to form almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution in the application of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see paragrap@@ hs 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; because there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be found and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate on half of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of individual , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is able to consider . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction occurred .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate encountered .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not simultaneously be used with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies cannot be restricted to direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were ex@@ pon@@ ed against larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to satisfy during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
the adverse effects in clinical studies were mainly referred to as in@@ fusion reaction ( treatment of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment time up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted pharmaceutical reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 years or older at a total of 45 patients in the age of 5 years or older at a total of 45 patients ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history were serious reactions to , including bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m , breathing stand and fac@@ ades ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 , with mainly severe sales and treatment of up to 12 months , were reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment to a ser@@ um version , whereby in patients aged 5 years with a wei@@ ghty shift in the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to premature retirement from the study ) were 13 / 45 patients not due to radio@@ immun@@ o@@ zip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients where there were never to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with out of low antibody levels caused by low antibody levels in the urine while in patients with high antibodies to determine variable reduction from G@@ ag in the resin .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro that did not imp@@ ly the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in the urine .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions even if the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the justification for the enzyme therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is swi@@ ft@@ ly removed from the circulation and cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate receptors . &quot;
&quot; the security and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients sur@@ faced , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ fied exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 feet .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walk in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - case test .
&quot; all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where it received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with the placebo group to improve the lung function and the en@@ vi@@ ability , shown in the following table . &quot;
at the open renewal study showed a improvement and / or maintaining that effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the anticipated percentage of FE@@ V is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lungs volumes increased further to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ ern@@ ess alie , prior to treatment achieved 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste from the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established , which remained constant until the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease of disease between patients , which has been considered through the use of a combined end point , the clinically significant changes to five efficacy variable ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one @-@ year open phase 2 study , in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients , at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe course of course and 4 with the middle course ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mir@@ rors in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z score for this age group - the younger patients with the severe course of course ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the middle course of course , whereas in the older patients with severe sexual activity had limited limited or even no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , research on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ si@@ ege schem@@ ata were carried out on the g@@ ag mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute audi@@ test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the doses scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a acceptable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two do@@ si@@ ege schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years has been similar to the elderly and less affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a other medicinal product against cancer ) in patients who have not spread cancer ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cell@@ ed &quot; lung cancer , which does not attacks the epitheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who previously had not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously have already received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies , as usual therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate ( an vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is admin@@ istered along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , treatment should be raised up , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of pe@@ em@@ as@@ l s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ at@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes easier to equi@@ p than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ignant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ specific lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients who previously had received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months , compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies however patients , in which the cancer does not attack the epitheli@@ al cells , at the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival times as with the comparison of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. , for the expansion of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
every single @-@ bottle @-@ bottle has to be raised with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of sodium hydro@@ chl@@ oride ( 9 mg / ml ) resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the flow bottle and is dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % of sodium hydro@@ chl@@ oride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ riding epitheli@@ al epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in a second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al metastatic or metastatic non @-@ cell@@ an@@ tic epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) admin@@ istered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of hood systems , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose , there must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment period , as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) within a week prior to the first sequ@@ ins cycle .
&quot; in patients suffering from a complete blood image , the pl@@ itude of leu@@ ko@@ cytes should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ genic En@@ umeration . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle it must take place a dose of dosage taking place under the deri@@ ving of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 to be treated for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient is the value before treatment &quot;
&quot; treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be can@@ cel@@ ed if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages , an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue in the incidence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical studies have no notice that patients aged 65 years or compared to patients aged 65 years is an increase of low @-@ effective risk @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of non @-@ sufficient data to harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
clinical studies were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adap@@ tations that may go beyond the dose recommended for all patients .
the data in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however patients with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ aries and / or Trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ umeration of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( with the presence of liver metastatic disease ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metastatic disease ) is not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must not be monitored directly to patients with regard to the Kno@@ g@@ chen@@ ia sou@@ ps and pl@@ em@@ itted may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es again has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and has a value of a ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es , Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as described in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was buried when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be dependent on treatment @-@ related patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium renal in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous un@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pl@@ em@@ eters ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ eters may need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pl@@ em@@ et@@ re ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clinically significant fluid hydr@@ ation - accumulation in trans@@ cellular space is caused by a dra@@ inage of erg@@ es in front of the dental treatment .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ology , and cervi@@ cal events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ at@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this drug is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of waste additives ( except yel@@ lowing , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because there is the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive system , men should be pointed out before the treatment of treatment , and should consult with regard to the sper@@ mac@@ er@@ vation . &quot;
patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can lead high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased pair of effects associated with a increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution must be treated if in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses to be used by N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate .
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ sets may be avoided 2 days after therapy with pl@@ em@@ eters ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the interaction potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pl@@ em@@ eters . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the device status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patio with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ties .
&quot; there are no data for the use of pl@@ em@@ eters in pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ est@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects during a application during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; embarrass@@ ed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful weighing of the utility for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re , men should be pointed out before the treatment of the treatment , consult with regard to the sper@@ mac@@ er@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; it is not known , whether it survi@@ ves into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby may not be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and pl@@ em@@ et@@ re reb@@ elled as well as 163 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin received as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

it is applied with overweight adult with a body mass ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie diet .
&quot; patients who take the All@@ i and can no weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not reduce some fats in the diet , thereby causing about a quarter of the fat @-@ controlled fats un@@ d@@ ded the intestine . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with placebo with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had patients suffering from All@@ i 60 mg , after a year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2,3 kg in the intake of placebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients in relevant weight loss .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after @-@ after , fl@@ ate ( win@@ ch ) with stool clo@@ ister , gre@@ asy / o@@ ed chair , separ@@ ati@@ veness ( win@@ ch ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ aging in transp@@ l@@ ative patients ) or with drugs such as War@@ far@@ in for preventing blood vessels .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ nutrition syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or in chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) or in pregnant or breastfeeding .
July 2007 the European Commission shared the Company Gla@@ xo Group Limited with a permit for the distribution of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body measure Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine or fatty diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be applied by children and young people under 18 , as not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; because Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ted , it is necessary in elders and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function does not require modification of dosage . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich sing@@ ular or fat @-@ rich diet . &quot;
&quot; as the weight @-@ reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control should be patient who need a medicine against diabetes , before the start of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who need all@@ i as well as drugs used against hypertension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage must be adjusted to these drugs .
&quot; it is recommended to take extra wa@@ vering measures in order to prevent the possibility of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with the current application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bar .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ ative ratio , IN@@ R ) may be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ enes remain in the norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ itam@@ ins before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin pills ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the gift of a sing@@ ular dose of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers got the same at the same time , a minor decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma @-@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; veterinary studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects have been determined from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side effects which have been determined after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain magnitude . &quot;

&quot; single doses of 800 mg at speeds of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to norm@@ al@@ ge@@ important and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose were either reported either side @-@ effects or similar side @-@ effects such as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .

&quot; clinical studies have been derived from 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 measure the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day combined with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fatty food . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change in the weight weight compared to the starting point ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction of 12 months was observed , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the average change was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) , and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of not met@@ ric or@@ list@@ at were 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate cataly@@ tic for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
Alo@@ xi effectiveness of Alo@@ xi may be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicinal product that may be used as an anti @-@ drug ) .
&quot; the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance is the bond of chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as serotonin ) , to the receptors in the intestines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adult , the chem@@ otherap@@ ies received , which are strong or moderate cataly@@ st for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong cataly@@ st for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients were treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 126 by 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate cataly@@ st for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 15@@ 3 from 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 by 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission shared the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the distribution of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer treatment and vom@@ iting at moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a particular cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron can pro@@ long the col@@ on @-@ length , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , be careful with the current gift of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy will neither be used for prevention nor for treating nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;

&quot; a clinical trial showed no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ ical Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibitors . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , Flu@@ on@@ avi@@ r , k@@ ic@@ avi@@ r , chi@@ tin , ser@@ pent@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron . &quot;
&quot; experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not available , therefore Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in pregnant women should not be applied unless it is necessary by the prescri@@ bing doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observ@@ able side effects ( in total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least possibly stood with alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ struction ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of adverse events such as in the other do@@ si@@ ders ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships .
&quot; however , there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an Alo@@ xi@@ - Over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies have been a total of 1.@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , &lt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ ck@@ l@@ atin ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study were a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ ar@@ mo@@ as , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which were given to day 1 IV . &quot;
results of studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the im@@ cent@@ ri@@ cular and re@@ pol@@ arization of the ion channels and to extend the duration of action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers carried out study was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. admin@@ istered Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in sing@@ d@@ less of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initi@@ alization of plasma concentrations , a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half of around 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plas@@ mas@@ con@@ centric ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the whole dose of dose of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in vocal and cancer patient dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous Gift of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that with once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous output of 0.@@ 75 mg Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron on 3 consecutive days achieved total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared with the after @-@ volume IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max was reduced from 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; around 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and roughly 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies on metabol@@ ites have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ da C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron are involved . &quot;
&quot; elim@@ in@@ ates after a intraven@@ ous sing@@ ular dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron have been found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron as an un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion at Ges@@ unden in 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients suffering from severe liver disorder , the terminal elimination of the terminal plate and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron increases , a reduction of the dose is however not justified . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have been observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , resulting in a small relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the length of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron ( each dose spoke in about the 30@@ s of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) who were given daily over two years led to a multip@@ lied incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms and r@@ amp@@ age in rats , but not on mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi for the unique application , the relevance of these results will be low for human beings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of this permit for the upgrade must be informed by the European Commission on plans for placing this decision to be made within the framework of this decision . &quot;

&quot; this means that Al@@ phe@@ on is similar to a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , with the same gener@@ ational effective part , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference information &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ phe@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ low ) hepatitis C ( one by viral infection prot@@ u@@ ene liver disease ) .
&quot; with a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation the liver tissue damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in amino acids ( AL@@ T ) are generally increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the drug .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ phe@@ on laid out data that occupy the comparison of Al@@ phe@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effect , safety and effectiveness at hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ phe@@ on has been compared to the effectiveness of reference to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment responded to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non Business .
&quot; furthermore , concerns raised that the data on the stability of the drug and the commerci@@ als are not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , who spoke to treatment with Al@@ phe@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
after setting the treatment with Al@@ phe@@ on fl@@ amm@@ ated the disease in more patients than with the reference to the reference and had Al@@ phe@@ on more side effects .
&quot; apart from that , the test results in the study to examine the question , to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust @-@ related skin infection ) and small infected la@@ z@@ ations ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this type of infections may not be effective .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 must not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient speaks to the treatment two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
&quot; the main indication of the effectiveness was reduced in all five studies of the patients , their infection after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.2 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients suffering from placebo based on treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin heat , Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ ici@@ ent in similar contact : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin @-@ mortality , about 90 % of the patients of both groups have been treated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go were caused during the treatment of ab@@ sz@@ li ( vain cavity in the body tissues ) or of infections that have demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the Con@@ centr@@ ation point .
&quot; the Committee for Human veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go arrived at the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial defects in regard to the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small la@@ zar@@ es , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the distribution of al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
&quot; the patients , in which no improvement shows no improvement within two to three days , should be examined even once and an alternative therapy to be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be cancelled carefully and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection began . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as agents , or is thought ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
clinical studies with secondary and open wounds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ icillin St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative treatment should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected function occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved by humans to topical skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , is a clinically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After current oral gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on cut down skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can be used dos@@ ages not required when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibitors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ determination after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement about the birth and the feder@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should be applied only during pregnancy , if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to make a systemic antibiotic treatment . &quot;
&quot; when deciding if the breastfeeding continued , or the therapy will be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infants and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have applied to 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that was used in Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most common side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation on the date of administration , which is about 1 % of the patients concerned . &quot;
&quot; effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated through fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of ret@@ inal protein synthesis is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a particular ties of the 50s of the bacterial ne@@ bos@@ om that differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
the data point out that the connecting site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ connecting site and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ field .
&quot; by binding at this connecting point , P@@ leu@@ ka@@ em@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P @-@ bonds and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infection forms , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity from ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ icillin . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a non @-@ incoming response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults has been raised 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment daily by oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and bev@@ elled skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ographic treatment of phy@@ to @-@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , some plasma @-@ results were gained . &quot;
the sampling was carried out on the days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic recording of people according to topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g / ml ; Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g / ml / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the PGP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabol@@ ism The met@@ aphor@@ ism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en has been primarily conve@@ yed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) which have been carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there were neither male nor in female rats on female rats in oral doses from 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure was reached than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin : &quot;

&quot; the owner of the approval for the upgrade must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ant system , as is present in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorization order ( version 6.@@ 2 ) , and functions before the product will be marketed and applied as long as the product will be applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the approval for the application is required to perform detailed detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ant activities , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in CH@@ MP &quot; Guid@@ eline on Risk Management System for Medi@@ c@@ inal products for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will be submitted to report simultaneously with the next Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated point , you should end the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , creams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface that will be treated with al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment from anch@@ oring to one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor to advice if discomfort occur . &quot;
&quot; after setting the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ il@@ en association or gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic lock that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag , which contains 0,5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied in the frame of one of two doses existing vaccines whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must be used only if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the existing vaccines can be brought to an end in two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her order is hoped for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis C may be given . &quot;
&quot; vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the approved vaccine for Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are used for the protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are admin@@ istered from three doses existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data used to support the use of Twin@@ rix adults , also as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix for use . &quot;
the main indication of the effectiveness was the proportion of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody @-@ centric month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix starts at a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month distance between injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are headache , loss of pain , pain , redness , redness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the inventory of Ambi@@ rix throughout the world
&quot; the stand@@ ardis@@ ing plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her chim@@ ney is desired , for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vaccines or for hepatitis B . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis C ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and Anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and Anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody @-@ values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet fully backed if immun@@ o@@ competent individuals have addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , as they are also protected with non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies possibly by immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
3 How in all injections should be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the development of the vaccine and will always be available immediately .
&quot; if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the 360 ELISA units can form form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ B surface . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , under conditions no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody achiev@@ es that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could result in a sub@@ optimal vaccine , this inj@@ ector should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , at Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood @-@ internal disrup@@ tions , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix had been admin@@ istered in the second year in the form of a separate di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ac , tet@@ ra@@ us@@ o@@ cular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is , in@@ activated pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined mas@@ on@@ - m@@ umps tube @-@ vaccine , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients on immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ def@@ ective must be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
&quot; clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of this wording in adults , was the frequency of sor@@ eness , redness , swelling , gastro@@ enter@@ itis , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
clinical studies were given by 20@@ 29 vaccines at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ level combinations .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mattress on a basis of calculation per vaccine , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain has been observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the test subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the prob@@ es after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
&quot; according to the entire vaccine cycle reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix had gotten enough about pain , opposite 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ency was comparable to high ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the prob@@ es , which were awarded the 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced sor@@ eness and reliability was low and comparable to that which was observed after administration of the combination of the 3 @-@ piece vaccines .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group were similar to that which was observed in administration with the 3 @-@ level combinations with 360 ELISA parameters and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , during the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , however , was reported a frequent appearance of pain ( at the injection position ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the share of vaccines that reported more serious side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccines with the combination of hepatitis C and 10 µ@@ g recur@@ sively hepatitis C and 10 µ@@ g recur@@ sively hepatitis C was statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; clinical studies conducted in clinical studies at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 per month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 given dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serv@@ o transfer rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 given dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard bin@@ aries with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 2@@ 89 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B was significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after giving the 3 @-@ dos@@ ages it significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ o@@ ats , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , a month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vaccines received either a 2 @-@ piece vaccine scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ piece vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for persons who were at the time of landed in@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old could be proven the persistence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immun@@ o@@ reaction in this study was comparable to that which was found after vaccination of 3 doses associated with a combination of 3 doses consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persistence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccines .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix starts at the same time with the refres@@ her chim@@ ney , tet@@ ra@@ us@@ u@@ ä@@ rem Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is , in@@ activated pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined masculine @-@ m@@ umps vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined masculine @-@ m@@ umps , which is immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ mon rates as for the previous wording .
the vaccine is both before and after the Res@@ us@@ en@@ code by eye @-@ looking for any foreign @-@ particles and / or physical changes to investigate .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other paths , such as bathing in wat@@ ered waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; like with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be completely protected from infection with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick / feels ) vaccination may not prevent a disorder .
&quot; a protection against other infections that may harm the liver or symptoms that are similar to those after a hepatitis , or hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed . &quot;
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ chy r@@ ashes , respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and above the usually provided administration of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injections with a reduced amount of hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and might give you a vaccine protection from the end of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is sometimes afflic@@ ted for people who suffer from severe blood disorders caused by the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s defense @-@ defense / is or if you / your child moves to a hem@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune system response to the vaccine may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Sa@@ ver your doctor if you are taking any other medicinal product ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have been admin@@ istered / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or if you have been admin@@ istered or this in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate locations and as various limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breastfeeding women are not given , except that it is imperative to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has become known since the opening of the first permit for the distribution , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio is positive for Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; however , because Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in traffic in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient position . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over one month with a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ph@@ asis or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - divided into several items with meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ too ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach leading hose ) or a nose@@ son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
&quot; this was not a comparative study , since am@@ mon@@ aps was not compared with a different treatment or with placebo ( a pseu@@ drug medicine , that is to be compared without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appetite loss , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ balanced body smell or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma cip@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle will effectively be avoided .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances since due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients where a complete en@@ z@@ ema is already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ema defect , which manifes@@ ts after the first life phase ) , then a indication of action if in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is individually calculated with the consideration of protein intolerance and for the growth and the development of necessary daily protein intake . &quot;
after the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for adol@@ escents and adults .
patients who suffer from an Early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ in@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arginine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with a Argin@@ ine u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be obtained in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with slip disorders , since there is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ sop@@ ho@@ gan@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets will not get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium re@@ tention and ec@@ de@@ formations only with caution .
&quot; since met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is done on the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also an delayed irrit@@ ation of cervi@@ cal syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve ations in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical experiments with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS occurred at 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these unwanted events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic disorder in conjunction with lac@@ ac@@ id@@ osis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Pan@@ zy@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ y neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose entered a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed at a intraven@@ ous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ ic active connection associated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is secre@@ ted over the kidneys .
Stö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen @-@ atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis is being updated and the treatment is commen@@ ced immediately to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease was carried out in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ le free an@@ alogy within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ aly@@ sis , the utili@@ zation of alternative ways of nit@@ rate ( sodium and sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced waste and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rates of new bor@@ ns at post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first months ) to increase diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and patients were treated 100 % prior to the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ mic encephal@@ opathy , but even in these patients it was time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients treated with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the orni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ ase deficiency ) which were treated with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet was the excess of 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to retail and repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patient according to intraven@@ ous poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral sing@@ ular dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in Tab@@ ular form 15 minutes after the in@@ gestion of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate have been established .
in the majority of patients with ureth@@ ra or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ia ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting is not a phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma pro@@ vable .
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which have repeatedly been treated with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma bar on the third day is higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ ic@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cla@@ ve@@ dic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after an order from 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either by oral ( inf@@ ant babies and children who have not yet swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ low problems ) or over a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ too or a nose@@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg , as well as adol@@ escents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arginine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in plasma should be held inside the normal area . &quot;
patients who suffer from an Early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ in@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arginine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if ra@@ fts were exposed in front of the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ ite from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid of the cor@@ tex .
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic disorder in conjunction with lac@@ ac@@ id@@ osis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Pan@@ zy@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ y neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
Stö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen @-@ atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion .
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle may be assumed that for each gram , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition . &quot;
after an oral dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after the in@@ gestion of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate have been established .
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can retain the finished product unique to a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this procedure , the small measuring of 0,@@ 95 g , the average measurement l@@ bs 2.@@ 9 g and the large measurement of 8.@@ 9 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dis@@ solved before use even in water ( the solu@@ bility of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ ous waste products that can occur after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
during the breastfeeding time you cannot take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine could go over to the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
&quot; in rare cases were also con@@ fu@@ sions , headache , taste im@@ balances , rep@@ lic@@ ating of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders , and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms in yourself , you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency intake of your hospital in the appropriate treatment . &quot;
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

&quot; angi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary disease ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ attack ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stress &quot; &quot; ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; st@@ aging &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ ali@@ ce with electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; is angi@@ ox for the prevention of blood cl@@ ots in patients applied to a PCI , a higher dose is admin@@ istered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow towards the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the major study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox for a certain gift , or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibitors ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during PCI patients there was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes used in the ar@@ tery , in order to prevent a clas@@ p ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood vessels , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year , as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have subjected to a PCI was angi@@ ox in terms of all indicators just as effective as he@@ par@@ ine , except in severe bleeding when it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other Hir@@ u@@ dine or any of the ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with strong hypertension or serious kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Angi@@ ox is on the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a decent replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd is a permit for placing angi@@ ox throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ operation attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with a emergency response or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initiation dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg was given an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg , and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after PCI solution the reduced in@@ fusion dose can be resum@@ ed from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is admin@@ istered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplasty . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI random@@ ness of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a weight of an directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of a all@@ ot@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds and should be a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg / weight weight .
&quot; in order for the possibility to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted medicinal product is carefully mixed , and the bol@@ l@@ osis may be admin@@ istered rapidly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dose will be given correctly . &quot;
patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that can be subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) should be used lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the ACT is located below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be admin@@ istered and the ACT is 5 minutes after the second stu@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PL@@ ACE @-@ 2 ) which led to approval was included , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment with an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe renal damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ox contra@@ indication ( see below Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be led 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous pi@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hir@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or irreversible de@@ contamination . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding - especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is admin@@ istered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI patients occur in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine most bleeding may occur in arter@@ ial points , in patients suffering from a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle to occur everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , should consider monitoring of IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ ality R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value is achieved after ex@@ iting the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in front of the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ties ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these drugs increase the bleeding risk . &quot;
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thro@@ mbo@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thro@@ mbo@@ genic aggreg@@ ation@@ ists or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ties are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters in any case regularly to control .
&quot; the experimental studies are in terms of effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development insufficient ( see below Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone ; 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questionable He@@ et@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in the patients treated with He@@ par@@ in treated groups it was more common in women than in patients with more than 65 years earlier than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding as defined in the chart of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occur in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; a AC@@ U@@ ITY severe blood circulation has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ed , retrosp@@ ectively , intra@@ o@@ cular blood or hem@@ or@@ r@@ hage with a diameter of 5 cm / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure , revers@@ al of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ulation of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a blood pressure , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alis@@ ations which occurred in over 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point survey , retrosp@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in 6000 patients who have subjected to a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in treated groups it was more common in women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occur in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects which are not listed above , were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organ@@ si@@ cs in table 6 . &quot;
in the case of over@@ dosage the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately to break away and the patient closer with regard to signs of bleeding .
&quot; Angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ binding inhibitors , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the ani@@ as region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ ach is tied in the fluid phase or in the straight line . &quot;
&quot; the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in has turn left the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby reducing the functioning of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Ser@@ um of patients with Ser@@ um , in which there had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ tive Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) to indu@@ ce no thro@@ mbo@@ cytes adhesi@@ on reaction . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine shows a dos@@ is@@ u@@ din a dos@@ is@@ - and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sive effect which is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if the patients were conducted in the following , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine was given and the in@@ fusion increases for the duration of the procedure to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in arm A the AC@@ U@@ ITY survey has been admin@@ istered He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ market ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibitors before the beginning of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or at PCI .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults and children and children from six years of age with diabetes that need treatment with insulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is given sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the stomach wall to the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or given as permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control the Glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is not effective .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is different from humanity , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of time than a short @-@ effective human being . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long insulin of insulin , in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body can not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot be effective in insulin , Ap@@ id@@ ra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ ashed after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % at human@@ ized Nor@@ mal .
Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin or any of the ingredients that are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
&quot; the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may be adjusted , if it is admin@@ istered along with a number of other medicinal products , which can affect the blood glucose level . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ av@@ enti@@ s Germany GmbH for the acquisition of Ap@@ id@@ ra throughout the European Union . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections either in the field of abdom@@ en that apply or to use sub@@ cut@@ aneous or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ fusion through continuous In@@ fusion in the abdom@@ en area .
&quot; due to the decreased glucose metabolism and the dimin@@ ished insulin change , the insulin need to be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active ingredient , the brand ( her@@ etic ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or demo@@ lition of treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ul@@ ant diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to a different insulin type or a insulin to another manufacturer should be carried out under strict doctor supervision and may make a change in dosage required .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the drug profile of the insulin and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; the substances that can increase the blood@@ stream activity and enhance the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors ( MA@@ O ) Hem@@ mer , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , di@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tika such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ e@@ gen counter @-@ regulation should be de@@ ported or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive ca@@ vities showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ kind in terms of pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ enter into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin occurs neither in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ted after oral use . &quot;

heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with consci@@ enti@@ ousness can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a doctor in accordance with intraven@@ ous person or by intraven@@ ous person@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
after a Glu@@ k@@ agon@@ izing object the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the pri@@ mor@@ dial matter for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of peripher@@ al glucose ( especially through skeleton muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ ans Ga@@ el@@ be comes faster and the time is shorter than at hu@@ gely man@@ ic Nor@@ mal .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , T@@ US showed insulin doses from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a dose of disproportion@@ ate effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportion@@ ate increase in glu@@ ing effect , just like human . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast co @-@ operation like normal human , and achiev@@ es complete glu@@ en@@ du@@ ous effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human . &quot;
&quot; from the data , it was clear that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given like with human normal species , which is 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control than with human normal species , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as at human normal species , which is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
