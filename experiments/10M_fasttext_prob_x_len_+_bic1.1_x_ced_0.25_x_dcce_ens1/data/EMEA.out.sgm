<seg id="6">"Abilify is used for treating moderate to severe some severe episodes and prevention of manic episodes associated with patients, which have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to the fast control of dispardent anxiety or behavioral disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for one or the melting table in patients where the swallowing of tablets are difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients who use other medicines simultaneously, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works as a "partisan agonist" for the receptors of the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent than the neurotransmitters acts to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and to prevent its reoccurring."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of bilify, the recurrence of symptoms, was investigated in three studies about up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies involving 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which lacked up over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify has had twelve weeks of 347 patients with semi-operated dol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been resized to 160 patients where the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was placed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which occurred on irritated restlessness, with which by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients treated to treatment."</seg>

<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms of eiving restlessness than the patients received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms are more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of long effective than placebo the reoccurring manic episodes associated with previously untreated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of eipped restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapial disorders, headache, blurred vision (nausea), relapses (nausea), irritation, nausea, insomnia (nausea), irritation, restlessness, insomnia (sleepiness) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Human veterinary medicines (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia, and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes associated with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of dispardent anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes associated with bipolar-I-disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 shared the European Commission to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is prescribed for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes associated with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients suffered 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiation dose should be considered if clinical factors justify these (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-inductor is eliminated from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychological therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder not elevated risk of addiction to Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocarditis, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, hypovolaemia, hypovolaemia, hypovolaemia, hypovolaemia, hypovolaemia) or hypertension (including acute and malignant forms)."</seg>
