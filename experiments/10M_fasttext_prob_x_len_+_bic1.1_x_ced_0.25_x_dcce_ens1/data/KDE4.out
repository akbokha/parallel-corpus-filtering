you can translate the module website in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu of ex@@ tras website . select from the folding list the output and target language of the translation .
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated to the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
machine @-@ mechanical translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produced in the best case a gross translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore the translations should not be dependent on the translations without the translation before .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated directly on the bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ page itself where you can insert to translation texts directly .
package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
more information about using &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the card @-@ card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard model modules from the package KDE ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for the crash , or the list of covers , if available , ext@@ ingu@@ ish . &quot;
the module filters ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory on different kind of filter .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M component in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; please choose the DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the just added Website . as default , the display begins with the root notes of the document , example : document@@ ations , all other knot@@ s are sub@@ elements of this root &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views to ensure the content of your local file system .
&quot; the feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , swal@@ lowed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is shown by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is set as the sum of the size of the entries in it . accordingly , big files , even then easily identified if they are far down within the folder of the folder . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation possess the right @-@ corner meaningful and marking settings .
&quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode , can either represent a depth of the slight recognition of the cas@@ ing or the figure of a different file name such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the surface of sub@@ ordinate rec@@ tan@@ gles may occur ( whereby thus setting error by restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm for Tre@@ em@@ caps should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . there will be frames available to the cas@@ ing entries of the entries , and this setting will no longer be lost if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how parti@@ tioning the area of an entry for sub@@ ordinate entries is left to the implementation . here it is possible for the labelling , and for the prevention of space @-@ loss due to the frame always beneficial to the areas that are used as quad@@ r@@ atic . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum surface area for an entry over the menu item view . instead , a drug pattern should be drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually assigned by an inf@@ erior entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , designed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ in . &quot;

&quot; digi@@ tization ; contains a quick image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use these to look at your photos , comment , assess and correct . the processing skills can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ment came ; easy to use , it provides sufficient professional skills to use . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit farms and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC colour@@ ing work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with a lot more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens to search for . &quot;
like all &amp; KDE ; programs also came &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&quot; checking out ; trying to make the reporting of problems or suggestions for them as easy as possible for them . wherever you use this link , your web browser opens a page in the error message system . all necessary information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developers came together with each other . if you have a regular user from &amp; digi@@ tization ; then we would like to answer any questions concerning other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , you will be able to answer any questions from other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tis@@ ation homepage ; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ tization ; is the registration in the developer ma@@ iling list . instructions to report in the developer ma@@ iling list of &amp; digi@@ came ;
&quot; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . just enter a local , remote or remote folder . just enter the folder icon icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here the data will be saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you will use additionally as an alarm library . setting digi@@ tization set up collections . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the pictures contains , when the folder folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; considers any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed throughout the folder . &quot;
&quot; he is looking for recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian throughout its depth . you cannot close any sub@@ folder , unless it came in pet@@ ri@@ pped folder . you can do so in a fil@@ thy folder ; by using a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ds will not take photos as symbols . you can change the photos from the album and use it on the folder symbol . for more details about this please see the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; checking ; your digital camera will set up . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; application support : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , it may also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ lo@@ er@@ a@@ endor@@ sement . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ ets and Ro@@ h work .
&quot; an easy to use camera interface will be available to you , so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by library G@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card information is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will appear as a disk drive . older cameras can also be used as a disk port ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , advanced software collection for digital cameras , which has a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras . it permits the transmission of images from digital cameras to b@@ illing and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally big files and transm@@ issions of the serial port slowly , this connection is now outdated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 by . a complete list of supported cameras will be found at this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to be able to read the instruc@@ tors of digi@@ K@@ am reli@@ ably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not permitted in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 ,
one of the most beautiful things in your digi@@ tization has come ; it is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules with all the graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module , to complement one function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; itself . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and embarrass@@ ed pictures work everywhere : you can specify a picture in another part of the system , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to lift the most common : JPEG , PNG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . so the fil@@ tern works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind icon is also displayed . what fields are indicated , you can configure in the dialog of the name settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ list@@ a ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ copy . all photos , which were saved by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes , in which they are stored on the disk , according to the names of their collection in the allocation properties or after date when the album was first created , sorted by the album . the date can be modified in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select a screenshot directly to an album . you can also select a screenshot directly to the album . &quot;
&quot; to move or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it down . in the then , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it onto the target album . &quot;
&quot; one album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to insert information about this collection . in order to access the album properties , you have to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album Properties menu properties . &quot;
&quot; album charts : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name for sorting out the photos or view albums . if you want to add or delete new collections from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add new collections , you can do it in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums .
&quot; the kno@@ bs , oldest , average , neu@@ tered : put the date on that of the oldest , the new image or the average of the album . firstly , the average of the images can be calculated from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; first , when you first came up an album in the album , the first image in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ list@@ a ; this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select a different photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; when Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau &amp; quot ; select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
one album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wel@@ ded .
&quot; digi@@ tization ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section &quot; &quot; My keywords &quot; &quot; list at the bottom of the main window . album collections will always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . once you select an album , all the pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two Lup@@ o buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you need to briefly wait , while the preview images will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can create new pictures in the menu Extras . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the displayed preview . what information you are , you can set up in settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area to suit your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the thum@@ b@@ nails will be equipped with help windows , the mouse frames . if you show the mouse cursor a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screenshot above in the section introduction to the main window shows some such support window . &quot;
&quot; photos are all about what came about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . you can get all functions , which came with &amp; checking ; you can get the choice between the viewing of the pictures , a slides@@ how or the processing of images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button , and Edit ... select a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . that &apos;s where your program is not counted , you will find information in &amp; KDE ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that the data can be saved after processing by other image processing programmes . some programs do not store this data with if you save the modified image . thus , this information comes from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC @-@ data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending etc. . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , there are two options available for rotation . the simplest one is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ led ; delete , it will be moved in the M@@ ül@@ ste of &amp; KDE ; p . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f If you prefer to truly delete , you can use this by using Shift . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My dating list@@ a ; organiz@@ es your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ lt ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the file view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ous . keywords are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . once a keyword was assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or search again . &quot;
&quot; selected if a keyword is selected , all photos , which were marked with this keyword , are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also book parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword : together , so you can find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords will be stored in a database for quick access and certain keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as digi@@ tization ; the images will be noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword &apos;s , or an existing keyword , click on an existing keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this article will be added to the subject of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , by changing it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a set menu that gives you the possibility to slide . a keyword can only be once a tree at a time . &quot;
&quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . additionally , you can put the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to handle &amp; digi@@ tization ; s functionality with keywords will be able to deal with keywords , first you have to download your photos with keywords in the tree &amp; quot ; My Not@@ e@@ quot ; draw and go there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the look of the images and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords used to it . in this way you can choose a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is shown under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu only shows you the keywords , which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time @-@ beam view shows a time @-@ dependent h@@ isto@@ grams of the number of images per time unit . a selection framework can click on this h@@ isto@@ grams . to select a time@@ frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selective frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all of the images appear in the main window . &quot;
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dates , dates and the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ end he search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search is hit . when you click here , the filtering is deleted and all the pictures again displayed . when search was found nothing , the lamp will be red . &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as those described above . you can always save this search here as a search criteria . after you have been saved as a search criteria . after you have been saved as a search engine on the list .
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , push the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the view My search list . if you want to change your choice after searching again , you only have to select the appropriate entry in My search List and select an option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you search to edit the search , the form will be available for entering the search with the previously arranged query . if you want to edit more advanced search , the dialog will be available to search for your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search available . further information can be found in the section The tool for the Advanced search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
the Advanced search will provide you an extended search form with a lot of search parameters in which you arrived in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database .
&quot; the list of the search rules will be used to set the options for a search question in the Alb@@ end@@ ship database . all rules are shown to be deleted by Oper@@ ators . an option can be connected with others via the logical operations ... , A ... , K@@ an ... or At least ... link . in addition , you can search for Type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows you to compare it images by compar@@ ing this signatures . the lower the difference between two images , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar way . using a Ca@@ vern@@ osa the result can be enlarged or smaller . if you want to open a picture of somewhere over the un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand color sc@@ opy : draw a fast sketch and your digi@@ tis@@ ation ; finds the matching pictures . also here a swelling can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini @-@ program . you can press with the mouse wheel or hold out zoom or remove it and move it . move it while you are fil@@ tered the left mouse button . all pictures inside these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; he has made a lumin@@ ance in a separate window at your disposal with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported imaging formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view on the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Ap@@ tically add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ance and open its window . if you are back in &amp; checking ; main window , you can open the ligh@@ tly with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can look at the pictures you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . if you can preview the pictures from the tool@@ bar , select Zoo or reloc@@ ation operations on one of the images , then they will compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures automatically will display in the areas to the same page . see the right noti@@ fied image will be shown in the right area . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering reactions work directly from the light , such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thum@@ b@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure .
&quot; at the lower end of each section , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you swing to the crossed arrows . to bend the visible area of the picture , you need to click them and see the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in mode , then both pictures will show the same image . &quot;
the zo@@ id works as well as in other views . just use the zoom @-@ shelves under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel in the picture in and out to zoom . this happens in both pictures when you sne@@ ak in the mode preview .
what is a digital inventory - aside from the fashion label ? the digital inventory is considered each part of the process which has been taken until the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photographs records a form of digital inventory . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect and use photos again . we look at the procedures for digital photographers who use &amp; digi@@ tization . we look at the method for digital photographers who use &amp; digi@@ tization . we look at the method for digital photographers which we use , backup , backup , backup , backup , backup , pro@@ spec@@ ing , archi@@ ved , backup , wait and export of images . &quot;
&quot; business administration takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , searches , searches , trans@@ lu@@ ed , con@@ formed , and exported contents which have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata can be stored in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim , if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not even know how many photos you have , then use the met@@ adata both in a database and in the images to save you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know before you have to organize something to your system , the structure of information structure is in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos may have to save if you want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; pay attention to a larger drive . &quot;
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly via your location . the remaining photos will organize a year several times in the same place . if you have enough photos then you will print sub@@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . ) then export a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant flow of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % of work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files makes it easier to ensure security and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an un@@ derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ adata store in the site of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written in the file . if you forget , then you can store the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , there is a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes , these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , since you should now choose any photo keywords , labelling , and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures you need the same attribute and then start the value . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let us now go with keywords , keywords , as you often continue to hot , or subject to other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from a different source with embedded stit@@ ches then it will be added ; automatically paste the tree for you b@@ z@@ w the pictures to the right place . the modified keywords are done by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; updated while the under@@ trees will be pursued .
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata can be cut down . this is a very rough representation , since each block consists of met@@ adata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and cal@@ end@@ ars data of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; most of anyone don &apos;t want to see your photos just , you want to share it with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to get interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! one starts to dream , associations , memories , the historical period of time , you may even even hear the silence . so the label has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him to help him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect when it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphabet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as marking . you can even export it to a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE has even exported it to your wishes in the label and / or the title of the web gallery . you will have to tell the story for the opening of a second time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? it &apos;s not earth a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images , the train leaves the spatial presentation now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities offered by ge@@ olocation and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travels via images with geography . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; quot ; copy@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and means the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information came in the setting of &amp; digi@@ tization ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not requested to use the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization has been saved . after that value , it should not be changed anymore . this field is not supported by comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; examples : linked with the author . this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples can be the title of the photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . as this is a mem@@ o to the author &apos;s author , it must be filled as well . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for supplier ) : use the providers in order to identify the photo . this does not necessarily have to be listed here . if the photographer is listed for a message agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse , you will see the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , or change the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ came ; will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; record errors , record , blackout , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which you can also happen in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re @-@ manufacturing company of the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be treated cau@@ tious and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , you can also claim CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good disc@@ ur@@ ks and good reception devices and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . it is therefore about choosing the right ones . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are highly vulnerable to mistakes , even if you are just written . therefore they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . despite this massive protection they are required for form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which seems to make miracles with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disk@@ ettes , disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . browse the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store to a clean , dark dry and protected against animals protected place . do not forget the data to read the next generation of hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ Manufac@@ tur@@ ers reserve your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google is available to this issue a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks . &quot;
&quot; soon : dis@@ close the error rate dramatically . electronic parts of the Contro@@ llers are the most common error message , S@@ MAR@@ T can not determine this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed faul@@ ts . these are especially readers of term and aband@@ on@@ ment . the expected time @-@ time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; these are only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be made without big problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices are not much aware that devices are different from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage . at your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage , non @-@ ageing , destructive motherboard and other defects . thus , protect themselves before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against currents is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy slots and it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ up . but remember that not any plug @-@ up also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning bolt and thus protects the right connected devices . &quot;
&quot; because an over@@ voltage of any cable can use to your computer , you should pay attention to all peripher@@ als that can be connected to your system . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable @-@ mo@@ de@@ ms and the tel@@ ev@@ isions . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection of the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection is protected from smaller oscill@@ ations in the electricity lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a drop of few seconds may lead to the loss of ir@@ replac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in a inter@@ ruption free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically put cordless energy when a blackout occurs . some models allow them to be able to keep track of the battery . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the battery life and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare its security in electricity problems with the costs of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind as well as your computer with it . at the end , you should always remember all cable to tr@@ enne before you ride into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that you can save any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , they are very expensive in comparison to the hard drives . however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost @-@ dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data on the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you will get unlimited memory that should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data security , the Web @-@ solutions are highly secure . transmission errors are automatically connected with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distribution of memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
the diagram highlights the elements of the transfer chain in the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integr@@ arity between operating system and hard drive .
the hardest part is that nobody says when a transmission mistake occurred when it was happening in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ detected until you have no protection against it . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet using its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that inside your computer .
un@@ reliable ma@@ ins are a further source of transmission losses because they create interference in the data flow . at normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not affected especially of transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
the FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record errors in a lower level and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms which are used , and is also not part of the kernel . &quot;
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . at not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the Me@@ ists think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or re@@ inst@@ ations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , re@@ iser@@ fs , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the spread @-@ spread file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ en@@ den@@ ds , from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and drug characteristics are not far away from this limit . &quot;
today cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is relatively deterior@@ ated for compact cameras and the end result is more deterior@@ ating . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel and high quality optics have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive can be found today for 100 &amp; euro , so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . thus , your data often do according to a plan and test this backup before you do something dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget flying un@@ happiness : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect an entire room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; hence , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is always a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up to the staircase , into your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a full copy at a time .
&quot; differenti@@ ating : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete assurance . creates a complete snapshot of two points : to that of the complete assurance , and the last differential . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates several moments . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes to a re@@ tired system next with the exception that it is just sam@@ pled , and not ongoing . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . as opposed to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transm@@ it@@ ates r@@ sync only the difference of the files that really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; this course of course leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come up for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the labour files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional endurance should be manually done after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; met@@ adata : met@@ adata , original X@@ MP files , original reserve , memory , scal@@ ability , media , restore images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visibility , ... &quot;
&quot; allowing valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noticed : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you have to look at everything today and evaluate again during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to look back as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . unfortunately , there is no other option to ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always increasing .
let &apos;s take a look around which you have planned scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will become easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . however , it may be much more pleas@@ urable , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . PNG can be relatively many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IFF requires and a slow comm@@ its . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images . &quot;
T@@ IFF was widely used as picture format . T@@ IFF can be stored in un@@ zi@@ pped shape or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compres@@ sional salt ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open shell format designed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed based on T@@ IFF / EP Format and is required to use met@@ adata for the needs and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nik@@ on at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Pl@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored using the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , usually in the raw format , since it stores the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , it can be connected to problems in the short@@ cut between the met@@ at@@ file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online met@@ adata standards that support a large range of applications and modelling , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the dealer or scanner . as long as the pictures are used on the cam@@ er@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your Roh@@ archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a delicate processing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut down from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only into Web@@ gal@@ eries , enco@@ ding you in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section Add to an album you will find a description as you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to the impor@@ ter of images to your Alb@@ end@@ ship database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; connect them with the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it . a further description on this can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator will appear at the lower end and the photos of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not appear on the camera lens for any file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a contract or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information which are stored internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note , that in some digital cameras not all the information is available . &quot;
&quot; the rider met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ adata can not be available on some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos to their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; checking ; . while downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired option methods from &amp; KDE ; select once you select the photos , use the button to download and then download the selected button until you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option is downloaded now . these images have not yet been downloaded from digi@@ tization . in this case the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in advance @-@ top . if you select this option , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the buttons , you can download or download the selected album , a dialog that you can choose the target album in which the photos are stored , displayed like a regular folder , displayed in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after having chosen the target album , click OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete the button Del@@ ete . if you just want to delete a few , you must first select it and delete your chosen plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility that you have deleted from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the M@@ ül@@ ste of &amp; KDE ; so they &apos;ll be carefully deleted if you want to delete them from the camera again , so if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly expressive names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to double the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
in the next section you will find options for turning and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ atyp@@ ical signatures . if you use this last option automatically a folder a day is created .
&quot; options Dur@@ ing the transmission will open three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two concern data on the author in the section standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the respective entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a different file format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S : % S . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option when downloading the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in big letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ came ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used , when you open the camera for the next time . &quot;
&quot; you can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the timing of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic spin is usually switched off , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it lets you turn out the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic spin , use the button Advanced and select the Autom@@ atic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is provided information about the date , which the photo was made available , you can create &amp; digi@@ tization ; this sub@@ ordinate is based on the image data . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data , you can read what information about your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; the photos directly in the Target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the button Advanced signatures at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos from their computer to their camera is the button Download . select then , in which you can select the files that are up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; KDE methods . &quot;
&quot; after the pictures is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you , where the images will be up@@ loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and push OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . thus , a position meant that can be indicated in long@@ itude and lati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on a map . the detection of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Gali@@ leo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to use an area by automatic recording of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ gra@@ fi@@ eren . environmental pl@@ anner , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click on the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users want to locate the place of the photo thus , it &apos;s good to detect the position of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how come the GPS data in the image ? first you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 contains many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly using the right hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and images using the K@@ IP@@ I module ( manual ) and finally on the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know there is currently no camera , which has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you will need to save these data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format used by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data from images and from the GPS and can be cor@@ related . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the water@@ marks to be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; you came to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization . to set up on these settings , you have to set up in the Settings menu ; set up . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; this action can be displayed on embedded viewing or image editing , so that they set the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; notes if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation and copy@@ rights data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected for download from the camera office . also in a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as an employee , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a closer description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publishers is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is listed for a message agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC campaigns store the data in the relevant IP@@ TC rim . this means that the met@@ adata are permanently contained in the picture and not only came in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; this met@@ adata can also be available in other programs and can be imported without lost .
&quot; images as embedded cap@@ tures ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG images : this syn@@ cs the comments that you will add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the pictures . therefore , your label may also be read by other images , they will be over@@ written by the digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear , when the mouse cursor is in the main window of a file rests . depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; and # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to set out what data types &amp; digi@@ tization have been ; view , you can add the file expan@@ sions of this list and remove any file in a &amp; digi@@ tization ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no one of these extensions , has been ignored by &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh , right from each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can be displayed on this page on the standard values . however , some pictures have enabled different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole cap@@ si@@ cal mode , you should only use a quick calcul@@ ator . if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image processing is using a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors will be fixed here . in the image processing can be integrated with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of light density than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the detailed explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment PNG comp@@ ressing , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this surgery is not reduced the image quality because it requires a quick calcul@@ ator . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can put this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option T@@ IFF files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sor algorithms for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of T@@ IFF &apos;s images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is los@@ sy @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ ers JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can easily save it . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph , met@@ adata were not yet supported , but was still in planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes , the image processing was only a picture of images for photos . currently , it develops very quickly with a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight line of green pixels respond to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the issue . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option marks the image a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ esp@@ ace is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the whit@@ ew@@ ash is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map that is photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the shre@@ w . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the shre@@ w@@ ter , i.e. the parts of your images are burned down , as a result of the in@@ ability of your camera will begin to look at the settings . the setting colors creates a few unusual results , since they re@@ construct the nickname in various ros@@ aries . finally , you can re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the Spit@@ s@@ ant . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . and d@@ ge@@ w therefore tries to re@@ construct the missing blue and red portions out of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a matter of how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
&quot; if you select the option , you will get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each picture individually . &quot;
&quot; if you set the lumin@@ ance value after your taste . you will probably have to set it a little higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . to keep the time working for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should go conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image that have many cameras and who have a matrix @-@ color pixels . this algorithm is also known as a CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&quot; and D@@ ensity came to you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it creates colour @-@ fac@@ te on edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your l@@ enti@@ ls , you can put the red and blue proof @-@ values here . this is certainly the best method for a so@@ fter correction , since it is carried out during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information like the color information from a color @-@ room in the other to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior issues when a picture is opened in the image processing / color module with raw files .
&quot; color profile files can set up the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed during opening the raw file later .
the color view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the cam@@ er@@ ture and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not have colour@@ ing mapping or gam@@ ma @-@ depth . this means that you have to perform the colour mapping for themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft @-@ profile @-@ profile with which you can em@@ ulate on how your image has to be given back from one device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that colour@@ profile is provided for them . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion lets the style recognize : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for portrait , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; KDE ; cap@@ tures and cap@@ tures . by delivering this interface , many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the board . &quot;
&quot; commands for tasks that are carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under settings &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slides@@ how should be easy to understand . the upper spre@@ y is the time between the image transitions , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other junction boxes off the met@@ adata that are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . beneath you are the port settings , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire Mass memory . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass stor@@ er@@ amen camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you enter your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer to put them in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes you arrived , the camera automatically re@@ alis@@ es . if not , you can set cam@@ amo@@ del and port manually . after you have installed your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option Con@@ figur@@ ing dialog for the slide of &gt; images in the M@@ ül@@ tr@@ mer , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; to delete a photo in one record . in the sections of a photo and delete an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be imp@@ lied through &amp; digi@@ tization ; applied if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply the changes to the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also put the display of the welcome image from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ lt ; to start connecting . this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ off process of the digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; when you are looking for new photos , you want to look for new photos &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed you ; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos were deleted ; if something from the base folder was deleted , you ask if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be displayed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , you will find further information on this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by clicking on the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting advertisements .
&quot; the image processing includes a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization , so they are not part of your distribution . you will be able to set up further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , the front factor , and the current image sizes . &quot;
a menu bar on the upper edge and below the tool@@ bar to quickly access the most frequently used functions .
&quot; the processing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , any of the functions will change the original photo before you save file save or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you saved the photo . &quot;
you should therefore possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file save as well .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Re@@ generate or the button The button re @-@ establish the re @-@ editing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last time . &quot;
virtually any promotion of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can undo by selecting editing @-@ cat@@ chy or restored by selecting editing dating from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB , using the tran@@ sit@@ ing or re @-@ establish button in the tool@@ bar , you will find a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions will also be cancelled or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture up , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can get in the photo and out zoom in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlarge factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can change this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; you can call it out of the digi@@ tization ; main window . see the section for setting up the image . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can select in the menu file picture and get the standard &amp; KDE ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . all of images can be printed out of your choice . you only have to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ter to follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has come ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions available for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navig@@ ational arrangement , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders will be displayed : &quot;
multi @-@ scale Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the resolution view , you can enter labels with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs from other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and will be converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented , you can either use the button or switch to the next picture , the label will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can write other met@@ adata from the selected file or database . but you can also write the met@@ adata to files . this is always selected if you have selected a met@@ adata that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section review shows a review scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in finding and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars on the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate more images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the review is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code follows the schema in the following table :
&quot; the view view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords and a sel@@ ector box with the previously published in this &amp; digi@@ tization ; session suggested . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the keyword . you can limit the number of options in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding address fields in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; select if several pictures are selected in the main window and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to select a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords and search views are used on the right side , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and off . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then a dialog that you ask if you want to put the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures in one cal@@ ender date . the keyword filter is selected on a keywords , which selected the quantity on three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that , a keyword from the right stit@@ ch tree was drawn on the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will be held at any start of the program . it can also be ordered under settings .
&quot; if you usually have created and created that it should be one or one , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the rules range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is sought after in the database . this may be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can define e.g. a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then follow the button group@@ ing options . the options then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in the full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly in checking out ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a colorful work@@ flow , that is the colors that come from your camera or scanner a pre@@ dict@@ ated devi@@ ation from the actually photographed and sc@@ anned colors . with a colorful work@@ flow you can achieve that the colors will print on your camera or scanner that you print or publish on the web you will print out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes at color administration , everyone wants to know what buttons he must express for the outcomes he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you informed decisions on every point of the picture work@@ flow . in addition , you will provide you with more detailed information to make your own informed decisions to make it possible to make the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your picture work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you must not take care of color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB colour . ( further information can be found below )
your only other images are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and make life for everybody so easy , why should one use another color @-@ room and have to make thoughts about colour@@ ing people ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hu@@ bs @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB colour area , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms so you can visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calculate my monitor if I have chosen to work in the s@@ R@@ GB colour room ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB color room or not , you will need to make your monitor cal@@ li@@ bri@@ ghter , as s@@ R@@ GB is going out that your ; on@@ itor is close to s@@ R@@ GB . if you are working as a bull of s@@ R@@ GB , then you have to use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , you need to use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard or both . &quot;

&quot; the functions norm@@ alise the same , automatic accounting and contrast extend from the menu . direc@@ ting Autom@@ atic correction is automatically trying to experiment with the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which works best at your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scale the lumin@@ osity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without its colour sha@@ ding . this function is often a magnet correction for pictures that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; equal : this method j@@ us@@ ates the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ grams of the integ@@ ers is as flat as possible . it &apos;s a very good result in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation which causes either miracles to a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic accounting : this method maxim@@ izing the color range in red , green and blue canal . they determine the dark and bright border tones and j@@ us@@ ade the red , green@@ ish and blue channels on the complete h@@ isto@@ gram@@ m@@ range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the highest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the whit@@ eboard came from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ lt ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ repell@@ ent of a photo .
&quot; the whit@@ esp@@ ace correction is a bit limited because of a color room with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can perform too far from the original image , in case you can perform the white straight in the raw mode , which is in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will be better to correction better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white @-@ repell@@ ent algorithms that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you will start using the menu colors white straight from the image processing .
&quot; the preview can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and preview of the Target image . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adjusted the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original wel@@ ded straight , it is enough to click on the bottom window . &quot;
the preview of the Target phot@@ os has a red mar@@ ker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this mar@@ ker is shown as vertical line in H@@ isto@@ grams .
&quot; shown on the right above is a h@@ isto@@ grams displayed that dynamic changes as soon as you have a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ grams is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lum@@ umin@@ ators . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow supports the shadow details of your photo or also download di@@ mming . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use color temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture show around the color temperature of the white surface . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white track displayed . this is shown in the Pre@@ viewing as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save As and store make exactly this . every adjustment of the white @-@ comparison you have set to save you in a text file and then load it later .
&quot; the button settings sets all fil@@ ly values again to their standard values and the associated neutral white @-@ comparison . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the co@@ ding pen per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high quality images . this code is also required for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and allocation of color film . colour mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ mets .
another important tool is to be found in the menu under colours . this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels at the same time and allows you to use it for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same correction . in the manual for the correct correction you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors of gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool Far@@ ming effects presents four color effects , a solar system , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a filter filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical work@@ manship , solar system , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of which was completed if one completed a partial print of a short flash , and after that the development of the picture was completed . the result was a partial explanation of the image . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to edit this interesting effect delicate . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase finally generates a negative image that so does not produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ety that makes it a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy it em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optim@@ ised color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for his smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color are also some photographers , especially those which hardly disc@@ ard them . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the sli@@ der re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ tes . in large images the filter can blast the entire CPU for a moment .
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos correct . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied . &quot;
if you get a photo with bad light@@ ness you can get the reverse problem : one too big sati@@ ety . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation reduce a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of increasing them . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool has a valuable correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you will need only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the h@@ isto@@ program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the integer values , an H@@ isto@@ grams , an active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der into the inside and which can be moved to change the int@@ angi@@ ble values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right side you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this sel@@ ector can be set , whether the H@@ isto@@ grams is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color will contain the linear H@@ isto@@ grams of a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification of a single column is dominated . &quot;
&quot; three shelves : the top for the dark tones , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three colours can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically convert the shade , middle and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic support . &quot;
&quot; results : the evalu@@ ates permit the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output rate , e.g. when used in the operation . the compression of the output can be used as a background while creating something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the images will be automatically set depending on the image values of the image . &quot;
&quot; store as and store : using these buttons , the file values can be stored in the file system and later re@@ charged again . this is used in the Gimp level format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input needs automatically comp@@ uted for all shadows , means and solar panels . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image of the h@@ isto@@ program for red , green@@ ish , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the judicial frame applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the replac@@ ements are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side will be the half of the original and the target pattern displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modification channel : this sel@@ ector allows to specify the channel that is altered by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two symbols in order to switch between linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant colour creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode is ass@@ isting . &quot;
&quot; if you move for example a cour@@ ty@@ board to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones are darker with darker exclusion and that the associated brightness is darker . &quot;
&quot; shown on the preview of the original photo is a red selection . if you want to change that mark on the range you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it down and then move it down to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gimp Rec@@ order format . &quot;
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the check@@ points of curve for all channels of the shade , central and solar panels . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to put the check@@ points for the red , green@@ ish , blue and lumin@@ ance cur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect just shown in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black / white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and solar panels was set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ came ; imaging is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can process it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image editing .
&quot; with the channel optional box , you can select the color for the H@@ isto@@ grams : this gives you a first hint of how you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window will show you a preview . the original may be viewed by comparison with your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the Target object has a red mar@@ ker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the H@@ isto@@ grams to show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; controls for the module are on the right bottom : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to maintain this channels . in case you activate the appropriate color component , as the channel bl@@ ender is then the tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black and white portraits to reduce . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color leads to a visible sound , which does not occur on the same place in the color channel , and their sound pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom in which you can reduce the color &apos;s first . &quot;
the stores as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer @-@ setting can be stored for later and then load . use file format is the Gimp &apos;s channel @-@ channel format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue canal is newly developed . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated ( 1 ) and the original picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capacity . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a labour step , since colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also using a set of film roll@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro , Il@@ ford X@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film expos@@ ing with a green lens filter . this looks good for the scene images and fits particularly well to portrait against the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ filmed : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . so much like the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) oran@@ ges . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film expos@@ ing with a red Lin@@ e@@ filter . this creates a dramatic sky @-@ effect and can simul@@ ate moon ski@@ ers to the daily time . therefore similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yel@@ lowing : simul@@ ates a black / white film expos@@ ing with a yellow lime filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yel@@ lowing filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle tones while he adds a little cold in the shadow of a pressure and re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; checking came ; tool texture , you can use decorative textures to an image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a colour picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop @-@ portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu on image texture can be used for this . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right the appearance of the depth or tri@@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text defect has been applied to the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; checking came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stream . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired fr@@ ame@@ ype for your image . elaborate the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce spr@@ inkle with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , abbrevi@@ ated it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : speci@@ fies the width of a frame in percent . the value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this set out with the frame image will be bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially when you have used the tool according to aspect ratio previously . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert a simple format text into a picture in any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , color from the color foam and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you chose for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking came ; tool Sch@@ abl@@ one can apply a template , using a template . &quot;
the menu picture template use in the image processing can be used to lay shine over a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you must use the PNG file format and should add a maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to dimin@@ ution the file size of the template , so send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate database ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ ti@@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ end@@ ars . these settings will be shown for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , a construction view appears to be reflected by the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ ner . the selection of a folder updates the thum@@ b@@ ons of the template automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor , and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the underlying picture . it is centered on the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ inks : this button dimin@@ ishes the picture below . it is centered on the image of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the image and lay it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tools to the edge of the field . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images . &quot;
sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually sharp@@ ens it is rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove the atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted from Winst@@ on Chang .
&quot; focusing is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more retro@@ active shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for private users .
&quot; in JPEG image , a camera is often used internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed while processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners turn a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable it , you get control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations you can get usable results by calling a photo with the archipelago &apos;s sharp@@ ness , which allows you to shoot with the menu . &quot;
&quot; however , you should deal with caution though the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also boo@@ sting the noise . in general , the most usable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image is increasing the tool . under Re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution , the picture is a little soft to draw . use the tool for soft@@ ened with the menu of corridor and experiment with some settings . the window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help you process the image . the for@@ erun@@ ner shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried out . an increase in radius or the amount will strengthen the effect . if you make the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask too strong , sound and impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius arises a how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radio stations . you should therefore produce images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image one that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference differential . one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a can@@ te of filters . in this way areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ pen@@ ed and therefore beauty faul@@ ts in faces , Heav@@ ens and water @-@ surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ led ; tool re@@ focus is focused on a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copyright @-@ protected un@@ folding filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to undo a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ us@@ eren@@ quot ; in which it is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than un@@ sharp . you can start it out of the menu by calling colours re@@ focus in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular folding work much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , depending on this , the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . that causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . you can set up a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but then in Heiligen@@ sch@@ a . &quot;
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values can be higher than 0.1 only rarely . however , the filter is higher than 0.1 . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to waste a high value . &quot;
&quot; pal@@ eness &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use these parameters if your in@@ sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is caused . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 , to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . in most cases , you should use this value to zero so that you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the smoke filter . &quot;
&quot; mattress size : this value determines the size of the transformation unit . an increase in the matrix size can generate good results , especially when you choose great value for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you choose great value for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the stores as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; attempt to carry out all tri@@ cuts , dyes , and integration types on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not immediately visible , but they later leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you are reading pictures and comp@@ ress , as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
theoretically I have to see un@@ sharp mas@@ king always to remove arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be seen the effect of in@@ shar@@ pen . for the Vienna filter you can show that it &apos;s the optimal linear filter . convenient is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is often better in processing small details .
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this picture has been made using an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ us@@ sed result is attributed to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ance correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the shelf smooth@@ ness is made the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that was dark@@ ened to create a more natural pend@@ ulum .
&quot; the inks will enable a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the instrument imaging is one of the most developed tool to not remove desired ar@@ te@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ an algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starters in order to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
&quot; if you want to set the filtering settings of a j@@ us@@ ade , you can use the tab for smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
detailed res@@ tra@@ int p &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness on the picture . wei@@ ghted values mainly homo@@ geneous regions smooth and detail . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing must be sub@@ ordin@@ ated and sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
strai@@ ghtening alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular or C@@ CD Rau@@ ches will create a high value of wav@@ y patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts will best be removed at a value near 1 .
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor over all@@ el@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth , as it is difficult to value the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effects it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : there is how often the algorithm are going to go through . usually here 1 or 2 out of the algorithm .
&quot; angle @-@ length da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen , there should also be small chosen . make sure that small corner produce a long term for you . you should choose this value as best possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral units &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ale step@@ width in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . he doubles but the term . we recommend it to let him go .
the buttons Save As and store make exactly this . any setting of image error corrected can be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged again later .
&quot; image error corrected is relatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , the calculation can cancel at any time using the button crash . &quot;
below you can see how image error with little ar@@ te@@ facts removed . the module is applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact that has been caused by a bad starting foot@@ age during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization has been a very powerful tool to reduce cap@@ turing . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool presents sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove spots and other ar@@ te@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor ru@@ sting from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ ority ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor consuming digital cameras , so you can read it in English on this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high standard of sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the advanced settings may remain at default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can clean@@ se the image over the picture and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the filter . this value will determine the filter forward . if it is increased , noise tips will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter images can no longer receive and ru@@ ff@@ ing or lubri@@ c@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response to the filter . if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise or noise tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak sound or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing detail .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ osity of the image . we recommend either color or ligh@@ thouses to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details controlled by the details .
color : controls the color balance of the image . we recommend you to change color or ligh@@ thouses to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details controlled by the details .
&quot; gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which is typically more dist@@ ressed to increase . however , it also tra@@ ys the atten@@ de@@ es areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adju@@ sting of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius . when it is increased , the edges may appear smooth , if it is too high , can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; store under and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how drug reduc@@ tions can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ able for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to switch with the menu item and experiment with the smooth@@ ness on the right side of the dialog . the preview of this operation shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the digi@@ tization ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ ar@@ te@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s , film gran@@ ting , scrat@@ ches , compression @-@ fac@@ tual and local mistakes in digital , original or retro@@ active digital images . thus , the smooth@@ ness occurs along the con@@ tours and thereby gets the content like it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm can be used for color and texture . the tex@@ tur@@ isation is carried out with another tool , the imaging correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / fran@@ ce and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it is even very far away . as a los@@ sy s@@ nu@@ g@@ ation algorithms , some small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed picture . this setting is intended to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons Save As and store make exactly this . any adjustment of photo @-@ restoration can be saved into a text file and will be downloaded later .
&quot; photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively quickly at work . however , it can take a long time and to move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ atorial smoking . the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ olta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ting on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo Restau@@ ration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was used with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts that have been created by the sc@@ anners and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight were used to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ ens . &quot;
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; to remove a photo with a dark image method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file into the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by C@@ CD def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should upload the appropriate Dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and it automatically invites you in the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result inside the image . the for@@ erun@@ ner shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels in preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ing : it becomes an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color will be allocated to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
&quot; linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 of pixels , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block . &quot;
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for pixel block are drawn to charge a bi @-@ quad@@ r@@ atic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixel in block .
&quot; cow : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to charge a bi @-@ cu@@ bian surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) , or a group of cu@@ bic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged at 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; far @-@ angle objects , in particular the middle and large photo format , can often not lower the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light the sensor to the sensor . Tele@@ object may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but it also has draw@@ backs . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the bl@@ ending filter , which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . for@@ ged objective should , even with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ly effect can result in motion . &quot;
&quot; with the big exposure segments of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ ace and color @-@ scanner by digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an equi@@ valence correction : the tool with a Center@@ filter is applied to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the correction filter and with three further exposure of the target . &quot;
&quot; this parameter controls the degree of light thickness at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ate the density of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ osity of 2 , sp@@ ri@@ cht@@ .@@ Just the density of a larger level of vig@@ nettes that compens@@ ate it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ nettes correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you will need to rev@@ ise the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ators will only give you positive values as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ation of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ came ; imaging of the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ nettes correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct picture . a lumin@@ ance and contrac@@ tion was also carried out with the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ led ; len@@ tic@@ ular distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . color@@ less distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree covers the general geom@@ etric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conc@@ ise form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third grade has a similar round @-@ effects , fla@@ ws at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the remote corners opposite to the second degree . if you combine these two can almost be eliminated any geom@@ etric distor@@ tion .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected and positive values kis@@ sing @-@ shaped distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ des . this value appears to be stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the opposite marks of the parameter .
zoom : this value scale the image size newly and thus leads to correction first engra@@ ving through . negative values increase while positive the picture increases .
bri@@ ghten up : this value appears the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ n@@ - or kis@@ sing @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all the cuts or size changes . best , do this correction than all the first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and carry it a ton@@ ous correction if the effect would be apparent . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool presents a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the sea or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ n@@ - / kis@@ sing @-@ shaped distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you have a kis@@ sing @-@ shaped distor@@ tion , the resulting image black fac@@ ets have . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ for@@ esi@@ ght or remove the Zoom regul@@ ator of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the ring @-@ shaped correction . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs as recordings from front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees will have . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ring @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ rar@@ ed film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ o , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview you can adjust two parameters , foot@@ age and sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option filling machine gran@@ ting to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter @-@ channels used to reproduce inf@@ rar@@ ed film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color should be missing . &quot;
this is an example of the inf@@ rar@@ ed fil@@ me@@ tic effect applied to a landsc@@ aping of New Zealand . the original image is set below ( 1 ) and the working picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the shre@@ w .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; filters film gran@@ ting is a simple to use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ting on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer has large silver gran@@ ces of the photo@@ em@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ular effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of daily life . in case you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular look especially in your mono@@ chro@@ mium photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated with the regul@@ ator to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gran@@ ules . the default value is , although often higher values are required to apply to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more bas@@ ins , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gran@@ ular effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ lt ; filters oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses the copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filters oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush @-@ size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for big images . smooth brushes are suitable for large images . smooth controls , or , from the other side , looks like arti@@ sti@@ ousness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the revised design is marked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixel is 1 and smooth@@ ness 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; filters coal drawing used color and integr@@ ator gra@@ dient to create a coal mint . the lines that can change the out@@ lines in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you have chosen which scene you would have chosen to sc@@ oring you . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with an advertising range from 1 to 100 in order to control this effect . the top reg@@ ler select the foundations and the lower edge , the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) . &quot;
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adaptation of the integration .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filters engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter came ; filters engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows it to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo in an artwork by means of distor@@ ting effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look like it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wave of wave 1 the image is distorted here with another version of gl@@ ass@@ kes .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effect at any time with the button .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into an artwork using ir@@ shar@@ pen effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ pe the picture along star @-@ shaped lines run by a central point . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ om@@ ing camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ pen : wi@@ pe the picture through rotation of the pixels in order to be central . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal un@@ sharp@@ ness : rejuven@@ ated the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused cam@@ er@@ aman . the object seems back to the background .
&quot; movement shar@@ pen@@ ed : wi@@ pe the picture through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the ir@@ shar@@ pen of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft in@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ink the image soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and subtle existence . &quot;
bulk soli@@ dly : wi@@ pe the picture through random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
clever Un@@ shar@@ pen : does the color @-@ sink in the picture and wi@@ pe them to change without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation any time using the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rops to your picture . thus it gives you natural your pictures a n@@ asty appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
&quot; dri@@ pping size allows the size of the tro@@ p to change . as the tro@@ phy size does not automatically reduce the size of the image , it often changes the size for small images . number changes the sperm effect of the drop in the image . &quot;
&quot; you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ment ; editing a sector free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face that should stay free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops afterwards , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the revised image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values have been used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools do you find in the menu Trans@@ for@@ cing turning or trans@@ forming mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; photo flas@@ hes is definitely one of the most advanced tools , in order to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality . &quot;
&quot; a picture to res@@ ists is simple . the big question is , how can you keep an image bl@@ unt and keep the details sharp@@ ly ? how can you find the missing information back or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is here a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to join the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for up . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blo@@ wers was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio maintained , if this setting is activated , will keep in the input of the new size the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth , as it is difficult to value the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effects it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons , as well as loading are used to be exactly used . each inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as text file and can be downloaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo blo@@ ws is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo blo@@ ws by creating a small colour picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard Aug@@ mentation to compare .
&quot; the tri@@ mming of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . in order to cut a photo with the mouse , simply press the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle when you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you run the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . thus , you will change a good overview as your photo after the cutting edge . you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be made by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the entry button , use the button of the button editing button in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file save or save in the menu file to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool according to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format always the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to width . &quot;
&quot; the tool related to aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ etres , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; below in the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the area on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; cut the tool After side ratio , save its settings depending on performance orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tik@@ al ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the composition help make it possible for help you put your images better together . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of similarity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : &quot; &quot; Golden Center &quot; &quot; is a division that leads to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sel or the blue he@@ ets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to build your temples and pyramids . artists and architects have constructed the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually follows is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
&quot; the golden middle provides liquid aid lines , if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below : &quot;
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to the third party the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ etric visual flow .
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called Golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to produce the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
the Golden triangles are also guided from the above mentioned golden spiral . its ver@@ tices are the middle points on the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . keep in mind that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not syn@@ onymous triangles . diag@@ onal to place an static object can be dynam@@ ically published . &quot;
if you use golden triangles to break up your frame you create an effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ally mirror and ver@@ ticals can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic ponds .
&quot; using the button color , you can set the color of the aux@@ ili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aux@@ ili@@ ary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture . &quot;
&quot; free rotation is a tool , to rot@@ ate a picture by any angle . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo , then it easily happens that you are not exactly ver@@ tically ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things came about an angle . you can repair and repair the tool free rotation . you can select trans@@ forming free rotation and j@@ us@@ ade the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . using the button settings , you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right above . &quot;
&quot; to your help , the module is free rotation of a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse into the picture show around the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you can download the angle as in the previous section . &quot;
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is to make the function trans@@ forming and use the image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function autom@@ atic . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth the picture a bit after rotation . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ ic transformations are carried out by a fix@@ on of the so called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you must use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle on top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle on the right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angles at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle on the right below : displays the current angle on degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
&quot; after adap@@ ting the perspective the image becomes a little scr@@ apped . for an individual adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after which you have adapted the perspective you get im@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is the image with trans@@ forming sugar cut out of the image .
the tool tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal she@@ aring for example will turn the top part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . it is not turning into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module about trans@@ forming sciss@@ ors .
use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . when you press preference , the angles will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown on the right of the view . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the she@@ aring , the image will be a bit more tricky . for a single source , this effect is mostly neglected , but two sten@@ cils are twice as so bl@@ amed and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the she@@ aring the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with trans@@ forming sugar cut out of the image .
&quot; digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of educational data with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF below . &quot;
&quot; this list shows only files in formats in the list . if the extension is listed on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it is possible to change this list of file exten@@ ders &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . you can support both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compres@@ sive methods on digital images . the redund@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save the image data on a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read using Wikipedia , The LU@@ MIN@@ O@@ US Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in JPEG or T@@ IFF . in the section configuration you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is supported in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in avi@@ al@@ - or MPEG format , but it does not have a film program . it is not a film program , and it does not have a built @-@ in possibilities to display movies and checking it ; the &amp; KDE ; settings to play movies to play the program for playback . &quot;

&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 you can do well if the initi@@ als was already very good , then you can carry out the first four poles with the module white . &quot;
many tools you need the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ tization ; they contain their description here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft , ru@@ ff@@ ing , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; use a uniform Di@@ alog@@ ty@@ p that is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture app@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progres@@ sing step shows the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of it , five buttons allow the comparison mode of the show @-@ area to change . these modes are : &quot;
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected tip area .
horizontal without dup@@ licate . the upper range shows the original and lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected tip area .
ver@@ tically parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper range shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the fo@@ aming area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setting .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can put this frame with the mouse within the image and set it on the part of the picture , from which you want to see the preview . the announcement in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all entries from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information on the selected picture and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini @-@ program . you can press with the mouse wheel or hold out zoom or remove it and move it . move it while you are fil@@ tered the left mouse button . all pictures inside these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is a editor for p@@ alle@@ ts files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the p@@ alle@@ ts files , those of &amp; KDE ; can be installed either for the entire system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; KDE ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ alle@@ ts , select the folder to files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the p@@ allet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color nearby . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here you can also change the color &apos;s name .
&quot; it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field is inserted in the cursor under the button color , the color will be inserted in the cursor on the cursor . the color will be inserted either or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is selected . this mode can set you by selecting the cross @-@ field crossing under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; edit the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a poin@@ ter sign , if another color will follow in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color anywhere on the screen and then find them in the color @-@ selection on the left side .
&quot; graph viewer : is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions . &quot;
the &amp; Cool@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; KDE program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of an integrated &amp; KDE program ; features in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; col@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of grap@@ hing in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graphs are new and in &amp; graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or the grap@@ hing in &amp; cold viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading of big graphs ( currently there are problems of approximately 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to show more than these knot@@ s )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; KDE program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own window window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar will open only the icon file and the ( blank ) list of final opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing space . you can choose with the context menu a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel use ( high and down without special cables , left and right with strong &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ id is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the straight file has been changed in &amp; graphi@@ cally , loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be shown : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or whether you want to change the change , so that later it will change as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings button ; see ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a Graph@@ ite ei outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the option whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the ID Grap@@ h in a sub@@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to be inserted onto this page . thereby , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one on several pages distributed grap@@ hing without head@@ line and with another font
the page again store the possibility to set the behavior when a file is modified on the hard drive &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can open a standard behavior in this case ( the graphs in a new window , or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
the site seat management gives the opportunity to set the starting @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can specify a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine when asked for each startup .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; lay@@ ered algorithm . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for exposed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representation of directed graphs . the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from above or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few tun@@ ings as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for f@@ eri@@ ed graphs . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ ray model . it is used as the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm that is syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ cally multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ marked graphs , a spr@@ ing@@ ray model . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ surface sol@@ vers for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm sl@@ ats the node circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ itty and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then accept a parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout , the command should change , or also the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graphs ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and turns the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for fair , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invalid graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed , unless this is necessary . otherwise , it is not displayed and the positioning menu is inactive . &quot;
shows the what is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse cursor on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the source folder of the source archi@@ val .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; KDE program ; is a &amp; KDE program that uses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
&quot; a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer , to use . in the menu settings you will find further options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the icon @-@ editing is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the box for string tools , the bar palette , the .@@ color palette and the grid network in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; created a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog that you can choose if the icon is created from a template or whether you want to start new . &quot;
&quot; represents the final revers@@ ed step back again . if you do not have a step back , this function is down@@ lighted . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
this can create the current symbol of gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not match with those of the icon range of &amp; KDE ; match .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color on the color of a point where you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current character , the magni@@ fying factor , and the current number of colours of the symbol . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read new pictures and to offer them to play .
&quot; this module can be used to read new pictures from external sources , and in storage . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
&quot; scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project , or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open the menu item pictures , a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to pick the image . you can also put the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the default values duc@@ tile to select your image accordingly . see the preview images and adjust the area to your needs before using the button . the estimated file size will be shown to you in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings else will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button Scan to the scan , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window will specify the type of image file . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you will also have to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image file . &quot;
screen phot@@ os you can create after you have selected in the menu impor@@ ter &gt; screenshot ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program window is selected , the re@@ viewing program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read , after a short delay , up the currently visible work place will only be read the window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on different des@@ ktops , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time . &quot;
&quot; after the screen shot , the dialog box of the target window will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Flick@@ r is an online version on the Internet . with Flick@@ r it is possible to show its photos the people that are important . you can put your favorite pictures of the world online and show your photos safely and private your friends and family all over the world .
the module exports to Flick@@ r can be used to upload pictures of your computer to a Flick@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time you use the process of gener@@ alization of a Tok@@ ens . it is therefore used for your authentication . thus , it is started to register a credit card to Flick@@ r . a browser is started to allow you to register for Flick@@ r . &quot;
after successful registration the module can send photos to Flick@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed on Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flick@@ r . it will be displayed in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module exports to Flick@@ r to the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog that indicates the current per@@ missions that the module indicates , you need not need any other permission . you will also be asked if you want to proceed with this permission . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pressed once to be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button , you can select in a file sel@@ ector box the photos you want to upload . if you press the O@@ k button , the up@@ loading of the photos to the Flick@@ r server starts . &quot;
the keywords can be filled with a separated list of words with a separated list of words . these are added to the image as a keywords during the up@@ loading .
&quot; with the options openings , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ s you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to change the size of the photos before the up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . size is taken from the maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation allows you to add and edit the GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available for images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the celestial co @-@ system , used by GPS and Gali@@ leo will be used to locate . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
to cor@@ related your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in GP@@ X @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can create a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relation in the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialog will then load . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alisation . this file contains naturally data that were taken at the same time at the same places as the images of your camera .
&quot; if the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore , the camera will be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation is a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and cam@@ er@@ bation . lies the devi@@ ation among them the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have a suitable data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can manually be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialogue will notice the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the shown map and be found and set in . dial the relevant region and enlarge You si@@ e.@@ Per@@ form it again and again and again . the height must be changed manually . the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed manually , satellite , and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images using GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to the version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages , and the parameters for the HTML pages provide UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ded to allow the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the riders selection allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . you do not need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right hand you can quickly see a large number of albums . in the field below the allocation show and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will be displayed .
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely explained . the option for each image is created a gallery in which each image is also displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your default name , eg . &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML5 Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other colours , you can change the standard color depth . naturally , influences the file size . all other settings are also explained . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s images allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thum@@ b@@ nails , that are small images shown in the gallery . &quot;
a progres@@ sing window displays the user as far as the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically shut . you can therefore read the program@@ m@@ ations to determine if errors occur during production . the web browser is automatically launched in the end to show the preview of the gallery . press En@@ ter to include the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image content allows Ih@@ n@@ ene to look at a selection of images and to run to them basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ om@@ al or slow@@ ing . the viewer can be used with short @-@ term and quick access to its functions . it was developed for quick picture @-@ indication , and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after starting a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG processor is a tool to change images without any quality without your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in the JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since there is no comp@@ ressing the color information . this can also be found in the PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it so please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I team among KDE Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata does not currently have documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the ma@@ iling list KDE Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the file dialog with which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work in all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slides@@ how .
&quot; the Module MPEG enco@@ der can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module also uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images will be automatically scale to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slides@@ how . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must first select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start the Module MPEG Sli@@ des@@ how to create the module . &quot;
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change coll@@ otype of images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is set up and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the one image is displayed . a lower value is created very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture change . &quot;
the background color can be next set . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and the path of the created file can set you under the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it is integrated into the film . after all settings will start your computer with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right bottom right bottom . &quot;
the printer assistant allows several pictures to print on a piece of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also automatically print with the image processing Gimp . this is e.g. : useful to improve you or print using the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original feature of Him is : do you expect the same results as the software from your cam@@ er@@ aher@@ ero . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ kon@@ verter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button Pre@@ view , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now rev@@ ise the values in order to optimize the conver@@ tion process . the first option will decide if the camera settings should be used for the whit@@ eboard , the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be j@@ us@@ sed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged Image , T@@ IFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ressing . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata file in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the output information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start using button button to start conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various pictures at once . use this mode , for example , by testing at a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is however not available . a preview of progress shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ bucks and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image of the image change or enlarge .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : magnitude in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen .
not proportional : not disproportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target pattern , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the send pictures before . additional pictures can draw on the list of images and put them there .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the pictures selected . via the button images you can add more pictures with a file extension dialog . for the last selected picture , a preview can be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also draw pictures to the picture list and add it there to add the list of images to the list below .
with the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of selected images .
after you have selected all pictures you can use the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the selected images can be attached to you as an app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and each time is used until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation , including the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you will need to install the G@@ mail@@ agent on your computer previously . you can download it here . &quot;
after the selection of comments in a marked file the comments will be added to the images into a text file and the mail is contained .
&quot; the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo@@ files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG image format . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking to JPEG below images file format , and the original files in the JPEG format , then the original image data are added to the sen@@ sing images . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut up so you can view the status messages in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will automatically end up . with the button shot you can leave this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced , a window with questions like you want to have presented your slides@@ how . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL exc@@ esses in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL . however , you will need to possess an appropriate graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
&quot; to view the file name , the file name of the images shown in the lower left corner during the presentation will be displayed . &quot;
the option loop makes it possible to show the presentation in a final loop . you can do it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures accidentally select that the pictures in a random order is displayed . so it is not used in the order of the pictures in the album .
under delay between pictures the time @-@ time distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transi@@ tional effect . so you should check out the presentation your friends !
there are over a dozen transitions effects between which you can select . by chance select a different effect during each passing between pictures .
&quot; during the slides@@ how , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner for you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides@@ how . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current date fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date II currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it so please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I team among KDE Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ O module background is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets up the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can look with &amp; photo@@ sets , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , therefore , in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you entered information when you have information and videos yet . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information that search the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to look at the current role models . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse to the entry to the item , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are shown . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures on some single pictures .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view images to view images of your efficiency . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store up with &amp; photo@@ sets , but of course for each person &apos;s own image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see also the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button , which you want to use right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . please note that you can view symbols for each category separately ( if you do not have a list of keywords for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you will need to specify which image for each individual person will be displayed . to display this , you will need to display the image viewer window ( in a closer ) and select the picture @-@ icon window as shown in the picture window . in the window @-@ window you can select the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image is to be shown or cut . &quot;
&quot; when you search for entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialogue for setting the image properties . this dialog can be seen at the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a sequence in the box label or description , the marking or descriptions of the images will be searched according to this text . if you want , you can also use a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , are not shown by Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try out the following functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the Quick Start and the introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; and choose the demo , if you start &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu named k@@ photo@@ sets ; -@@ demo . then , some examples are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar will see you here : as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time @-@ line can display several different time units . each bar shows then another unit . you can switch between units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the box only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively using on the following ways : you can edit the displayed entries in the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date is displayed in the preview window ) and also the tim@@ eline will always be shown the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a area of the tim@@ eline by stopping the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ ings , draw . if you select a range , you will show you in the preview view just pictures of this period . you can select the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; Cas@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML web pages with your images . one is integrated in &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; integrated in &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; integrated version which you can create through the menu file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML @-@ Pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the moment and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ sets ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ album ; export file will be created , which is to be seen on the Over@@ view page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML page are to be displayed . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all images are exported from a party . note that all images are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting in order to hide certain images from certain considerations . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can set how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions on the images . therefore , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor which supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your side may change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can lead your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission rate , as if he wants to get a picture bigger he changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , you place the different folder and the URL , where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set up a new sub @-@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to select the root folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and selected for the next time . you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocols for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if this really is all visible for viewers . if you have created a URL for the base folder after the pages have been created . the URL you decide here should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder , you will need to copy them manually to the final target folder . so that the import function , see correctly , you will need to specify the final goal of the files , but the root folder in which all sub@@ folders can be found . &quot;
&quot; the setting options described are all three based on basic folders and URLs . in this case , a sub@@ folder created , whose name you can set up in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are at a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create your pictures with these pictures . of course , you may have a HTML page to view images , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ sets ; this work does not even have to do so . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import other into your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you differ in it whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage is all the pictures to the file and this file can be able to pass on so independently . the obvious draw@@ back is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file expor@@ ters ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in the .@@ k@@ im file . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML export files . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialogue for the exporting of images is described , which you can access via the menu file ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices available :
if you are manually copy the file to the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
&quot; with the Autom@@ atic option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copied &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; the images automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most of the pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML @-@ file itself is very small it is usually not worth the files to comp@@ ress . if you prefer this , just select the option Export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit the maximum size . if you want to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be up to 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to the impor@@ ter is made up of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import will be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a divi@@ der ) , while this category is required for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog window , which categories of imported files are to be imported and what categories are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can calculate the categories of imported files using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be simple to search pictures and view : when you look at pictures , one often wants to see pictures of your picture @-@ groups and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) commemor@@ ating the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the search and reputation to go through ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; this manual was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this includes videos . &quot;
&quot; it saves all his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can save with a program of your choice , e.g. regular backup tools , copy to a disk or revisions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; see the folder in which your images are stored and used again for future start . in case you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; thus , you can start a different folder with images , so you can start a different folder with images , so you can start a different folder with pictures . as an example : photo@@ copy -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; set up on the menu settings k@@ photo@@ sets ; set up a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings . &quot;
&quot; to the left you will see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , you can use a detailed assistance to the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it has been described as you can define for each image different features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; in view of the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and select a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue options you can set up full members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , rather than explained all the groups of a ma@@ gli@@ eds like in . &quot;
&quot; in view you can see the settings which are available to the festival , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left pane , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphic applications such as checking K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; KDE ; image Plugin Interface . nutritional information about this you can find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications in each other , it may be that modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; demo database can always be tested with the demo database before you call them on your own images using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu Help . do not say I would not have been warned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , thus it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; col@@ photo@@ sets ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules that you can use the order with &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; &quot;
&quot; the current album is simul@@ ated and the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , thus all pictures , which shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album has to go &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; the modules also has a list of albums . here , this is a look like this : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , it will be the category which you have specified in settings as category for virtual albums . so if you use the category for example , will do &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; so do if you have chosen individuals to view and share this module . &quot;
&quot; because some modules with &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible are you can remove them from the list of modules . start settings and select the module modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; start with your own images . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , look at the top of a menu and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar , you can see the window that you want to see your image database . in the section , please click on this window , now please click on this window to show you an overview of all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the possibility to provide any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the picture has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of pictures given certain notes at the same time . if for example , shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view of three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; since you will always use it again if you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the shifting of images inside the list : if you have a family celebration , and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the names used are shifted to the top that people can find faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments to each picture individually selected , you may still want to edit any selected images and check these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; shown on the picture you can see a browsing window of the US as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the note catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also draw an entry to a category and place it in order to verify these to a sub@@ category of this agreement . note that you are currently alphabe@@ tically modified by your categories . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the note catalogue , by forming the box that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by setting it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click the button Options ... which gives you the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame also completely out . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then window one / out . this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures displayed in the browser , you will get an overview with thum@@ b@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all pictures in the case you do not have a filter . an example of this can be found here . you can configure the size of the thum@@ b@@ nails , by simple looking down pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture name . if you have not opened a window with a picture name , a new ad window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the picture show . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , and select either the Send key or select in the menu Edit selection . now , the window will be shown you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; photo@@ sets album ; for example , you can have saved the pictures somewhere else , so you have to record the pictures somewhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , are the instruc@@ tors available so you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also see these pictures with the image viewed . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this feature , you need to copy files from the folders and copy them again . &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; does it yet support you to avoid the entry of your images , so please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you will find the pictures so that at the end of those who want to see for others and click on the menu . alternatively , you can block all the pictures that can block your little sister and block the menu . &quot;
&quot; you set up which images will be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to add the laptop to your small sister , simply select the menu item . if you want to see the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one , all the pictures on the hard disk and the other one can access the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . this type of password protection serves only to those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ sets ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours of hours with it , of course , that you want to look at it sometime . for this reason it has a picture _ and video view . this can be seen from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the viewer . of course he shows the image , but additional all the information you have to type about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the in@@ fo@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag them with the mouse and put anywhere else . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then you can see the text menu below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , see the browser , see the matching entries for this . if you are looking to Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you chose persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can jump between them and go back by using the buttons image up and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slides@@ how . then it invites you to press a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image after clicking the C@@ tr@@ l and Plus or minus . then , the slide show through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; can be changed in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to the screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can in the image in and out zo@@ id . you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can get back r@@ all@@ omes The plus @-@ button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn zo@@ om@@ t . with the equality of the Zo@@ oms , allowing each pixel to the screen to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that in and out zo@@ id with the pl@@ us@@ - and M@@ inu@@ sta@@ che are .
&quot; with the rotating functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture using the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you can look at pictures it may happen , which you will have forgotten a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten in the picture . at the moment you can enter the picture and notice the configuration dialog of the image to mark this name . you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and view further pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper developed . to see what photos do you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you are one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for both examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features , while you are viewing them . characteristics are the characters A to Z and you can put a characteristic of that you press the corresponding letters . in view , you can see a picture with which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have placed features to your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special characters can be displayed in the view view . if you have shown some of the categories in d@@ re view , you can simply press the letters for the character after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case allows you &amp; Cas@@ photo@@ sets ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture will not be stored with the image but in the database . on the way you can undo your painted later .
&quot; in , you can see a picture on the painted page . to un@@ lock the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; just click on the picture to finish out of the context menu . just finish the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the properties and the object is shown in the wire mesh .
&quot; you can also choose several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position when you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following fol@@ dable menu appears , so you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with dele@@ tion either from the menu bar , to edit or from the context menu of the right button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have modified properties , click on users to take these changes . if you entered the invalid values , a message is displayed with a bug description . then , you can correct the input errors and again click on user or reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the dialog dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with assistance . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the owner &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; sque@@ eze preview in the sound@@ ing view and a small example of the scene is ri@@ pped with the chosen texture , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , let you cross locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross at the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and spin as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
each object has a range of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the level of higher level of level or as an absolute value . objects are only shown when they are selected or their visual amplifier is smaller or equal to the level of visual expression of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window of window as default . the object tree and the view of the properties are left to the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window , or if you need another arrangement , you can adjust them as you like . you can also store multiple windows and easily switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window on or below one view , pull the beginnings to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , pull the beginnings to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
if you wish to arrange multiple views over one another take advantage of the beginnings right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views through clicking the card record in the top of the views .
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are ho@@ ver views : views that are not ens@@ hr@@ ined in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , pull the Anf@@ asser on the Desktop or click on the small to the left top @-@ cursor arrow in the an@@ em@@ ing bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade @-@ bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are protective , you can anchor them to any place . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window arrangement ... save a dialog in which you can save the window of window under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written automatically &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders the icon ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the scene entry scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of overall performance in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon at The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that makes the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you just want to ren@@ ame a small area of the picture , select the junction of the section and enter the image of the image into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality you can select the characteristics , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used to ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture with only one beam can be termin@@ ated , there are various errors to occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stool effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this property better .
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is called super @-@ Sam@@ pling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ Sam@@ pling is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is further divided again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ ren@@ sion@@ ing depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; when you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray worked out a beam of pixels . if the difference between colour values is reduced , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling . if you calculate the depth of 4x@@ 4 additional points , a repository of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . when the difference between colour values exc@@ eeds the pre @-@ given threshold , then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be checked individually and be checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the repository . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the final attitude for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use lighting re@@ flexi@@ on . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card , you can set whether the alpha channels to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ account output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ends , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu item impor@@ ter ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler now supports &amp; po@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command from &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if the impor@@ ter error messages or warnings occur , a dialog window displays a list of all reports . &quot;
if you do not support sourc@@ ec@@ ode in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this includes the source code of the object in the newly opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , just highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command will be called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; one scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; click on help in the owner &apos;s view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter / v@@ ray ) into the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that do not lie in the folder of the scene , you will also need to insert the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for the display of the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characteristics .
&quot; you can adjust the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; greater values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better sewing for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross High Detailed fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all the wire model is further divided , if the camera uses an extended projection screen . extended projections are all projections for projections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; when you cross wall display , a wall behind the objects is placed . the wall is represented in a box pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a floor is depicted below the objects . the floor is depicted in a box pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the cant@@ ons , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling value can be set . more accurate information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can create existing window regulations or create new window regulations . in the section window regulations , you will be able to create and store windows . &quot;
the combination field standard window : displays all existing windows . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window of window at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window regulations displays all existing windows . a new arrangement can be created using the button Add , and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove . &quot;
each window of window is identified by the name of the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created using the button Add Add and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ lock the window below the existing window , with box map , you get a card view , with the previous view and floating view not in the main window , but generates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully notice the following warnings , before you make sure that you get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set up a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; following window rating : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their use . &quot;
&quot; starting with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you generate . in particular , this is the scene from the point of view of the camera . this is the result of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can find the content of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera will be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved later instructions , but note that the camera can change in the view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button or press the input , change the wire model and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could add for example a tas@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is an essential method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button user or the input bar . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is also shown the level , even though at the moment only a limited time . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can cl@@ ash the entry for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise under the horizon , just so you get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the owner &apos;s view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view , see how the pig@@ ment looks like . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a weak black material because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , keep in mind that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the simplest . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview color on qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now right . if you click on the icon with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you will have to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board list can only be used with two colours ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the object tree every time , and change the colors in the view of the properties : &quot;
&quot; this step you should already run simply , since you should have understood the fundamental way of working &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; it is just as easy as the floor to create : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the properties , you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input bar or the button user to press ) , so that the ball will float above the ground , since you have moved the ground around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering results now a strange result : as before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a weak black material . put in the next step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you now . as already on the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select En@@ ter and modify the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select mono@@ chrome and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screenshot and click on application or press the input bar .
&quot; the settings radi@@ ance effect and reflection gives already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler now offers . hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you are ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene sho@@ ots the hypothe@@ tical rays of the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera containing the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender is calculated , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as ne@@ bul@@ ae . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will be able to see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the image is simply black . obviously every scene which should be termin@@ ated , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
represents the scene in the last saved version again . all changes since the last storage are abandoned .
&quot; you can only select this menu , if you have not saved changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , the last rever@@ sible command . this menu item can only select , if you have used Edit back@@ sli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; save the current window , and opens up a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new command commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands may change or add new commands .
&quot; open up a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove the option &quot; &quot; tool@@ box for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove commands . &quot;
&quot; a dump map is a way to pre @-@ use non @-@ smoking finishes , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually , and to change without the geom@@ etric form of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file as for a p@@ umping map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geom@@ etric designs that you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then dealt on to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture @-@ map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels basis by applying a image file as a color card .
&quot; f@@ ateful show ; is a comfortable picture @-@ viewed and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ateful show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button will display .
&quot; you can set whether each image is to be displayed in your own window , or if all pictures are always to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if an appropriate file name appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ateful show ; there are five cards of cards . in three of them , General and processing and slides@@ how , you can set the mode of operation and commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective window can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is not large enough , the images are not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point enabled , invites &amp; ku@@ ateful show ; already see the next picture in the folder while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slides@@ how . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ ateful show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ateful show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the window will also be filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can see &amp; ku@@ dos , so set out that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
with this option the display unit is increased to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
determine whether the slides@@ how with the first image will begin in the folder or with the selected picture .
&quot; the time @-@ span between the image changes in a slides@@ how . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slides@@ how long is repeated until it is cancelled from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ dos , in the card cards for the display and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thum@@ b@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
dimin@@ ishes the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&quot; closes the display window for the pictures . &quot; &quot; f@@ ateful &quot; &quot; is also closed , if no browser window is opened . &quot;
view the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the file name , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ y ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ photo of the work based on the digi@@ tization ; imaging . &amp; show@@ picture ; is part of the digi@@ tization ; project .
the show@@ picture ; is a quick image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and carry out corrections and modifications .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; KDE ; is &amp; show@@ picture ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; the menu features you as simple as possible errors or possible improvements . wherever you use it in the program , the menu contains an entry to reports you issues or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled , and you can simply follow the guide to post your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user of the user @-@ ma@@ iling list from &amp; show@@ photo ; however , we &apos;ll be able to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ picture . however , in this ma@@ iling list will be English spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ y ; it is to join the developer ma@@ iling list . instructions to join the developer ma@@ iling list of &amp; show@@ y ;
&quot; we try to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that access the behavior of &amp; show@@ y ; setting up on these settings , you have to switch between these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ers you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposed inde@@ b@@ ator was selected . work@@ ings should display the colors with what you should see , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ picture ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and promotions at the selected pictures . you can also find this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that does not make more than images to scan and to play .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for inser@@ ting images that do not make more than images to scan and to store . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for each image a dialog to save or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also show the pictures before the file .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE page by selecting the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ project / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a default scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner was not open or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and push OK to open the scanner . drain and quit .
the other settings contain more deta@@ illed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; to get a picture , the user can only start a preview can and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the picture , the user can move into the image and out of the current selection . he can also set the zoom in that the complete preview in the window fits . &quot;
if the picture was selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when searching for a preview of settings in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a for@@ ter , as shown below , the image is saved and ch@@ lie ? en leads to a crash and you will go back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can look at the picture , if desired , see before saving . in this case the option should display a preview display . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be selected . &quot;
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save . dialogue to save for each image will open the dialogue before each sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; these automatically want to save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
this setting defines where the pictures can be saved on the option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored on any scan then this folder is used as default for dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
&quot; this parameter defines a picture of the image automatically to be saved images and in addition , the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix the jed@@ es@@ mal is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the quality of images to save image quality . this value is also changing the compression value when storing . if select the image quality , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button Help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button over starts the KDE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing it can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; uses how all other programs short@@ cut down . below you will find a list of these cuts and function . you can set up a list of these cuts and keyboard short@@ cut by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window and select &quot; commands ... select &quot;
&quot; you may have to set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ short commands function . thus , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general features that are mostly found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P function of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; . in addition Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; if you would like to give a feedback to the user , if the script is not executed due to a lack of dependence . please check in your script as if all the required modules are present and use it dialog , so that the user may know why a script does not work . &quot;
start @-@ in &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um ( KDE Bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ port@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder scripts / click , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each KDE installation should be attached . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all ongoing scripts . for this reason strings should be constantly monitored and react according to events . of course a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
&quot; configure We@@ is the script to display the dialog dialog . to save and store the setup data you have to take care of any script yourself . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is a integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ is@@ Connect Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu bar rel@@ ies the path to the selected files of the playlist that can be used to identify the cli@@ cked menu . to add an entry to the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script @-@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . in order to remove the script you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu @-@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , stop , or if the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example , e.g. storing data or configuration directives . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script @-@ management can also install script packages which can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ o@@ ok script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script @-@ packages with the Advanced . for this reason you should correctly ren@@ ame your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) ; the rest to lad@@ le modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
&quot; if your script is finished , you can put it up on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; listen to the post on KDE apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for a very special title from thousands of thousands in your collection . you are looking for a very special title from thousands of tracks in your collection . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist is still hard for you , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to get your music new ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the basic folder of the Amar@@ o@@ ok sources you have to enter the following , to compile Amar@@ o@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no trouble making it . if you encounter problems , please report these to the &amp; KDE ; ma@@ iling lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has like most applications some options that can be activated or disable certain options by the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies have to be met so that they can be used . details of this can be found in the section system Requi@@ re@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; you have a choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help you develop &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you would like to use full use . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up without efforts on the setup dialog . the setup dialog box has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
&quot; player window allows you to display the player window in addition to the playlist , respectively . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tuning @-@ bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option will switch the experimental function of the voting ometer . &quot;
atmospheric : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this is the used color scheme for the m@@ oods .
&quot; mood files are stored in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files in the settings of the corresponding music files are stored . otherwise the .@@ mood files in the settings of the respective music files are stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser is started by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , if a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; on other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not on the list above it . &quot;
&quot; playlist when storing , save the current playlist automatically when you want to stop &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist at the end of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manual play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use the absolute position of the music files . &quot;
&quot; actual piece for the change of change can be seen , in order to hold the play@@ lists window - / scroll down to keep the current piece always in the visible window . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context @-@ browser , automatically changes the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section appearance you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is in three parts sub@@ part .
&quot; in the fonts @-@ section you can adjust the use of different scriptures in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ily ; adjust by flag@@ ging of own writings , the otherwise grey presented section will be activated . you can choose to select the following range : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of customised color scheme , you yourself have the tor@@ ment of choice and can specify a separate color scheme . use them including cap@@ itali@@ zed color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start , results &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start the reproduction automatically continues with the piece at the place , with which it stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display set up the switching of the OS@@ D . when On @-@ Screen display is pressed , a preview of the OS@@ D displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on selecting ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the junction of the shade causes the text in the OS@@ D sha@@ ded .
&quot; your own colors will give you the opportunity to adjust the OS@@ D colors for font and background . one click on the color surface opens the dialog for color selection . if individual colors do not use enabled , the pre @-@ presented &amp; KDE ; colours are used . &quot;
the text field display @-@ text presents the text in the OS@@ D text . by type of plac@@ eholders the OS@@ D can be adjusted to its own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can decide on which screen to appear on the OS@@ D screen .
the audio @-@ output audio @-@ output lets you choose an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate further settings in this box .
the map collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder you want to search the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the cross box next to its name . &quot;
sub@@ folder as well : this causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; well as their sub@@ folders and their sub @-@ folders as well as their sub@@ folders .
&quot; changes to monitor : enables &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to be added or deleted the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will be added later in the playlist browser . &quot;
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : can you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another facility is required in the &quot; &quot; My@@ S@@ ql institution . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql institution is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used under calcul@@ ator , the machine is entered under port : the database port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , which the connection is made . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the card @-@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can provide the names of played pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and can create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
split pieces and to update such a profile : this setting will allow it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to send the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts call off : after activation of this setting will call &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to check in each other . note : you may need the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screenshot .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok only needs the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you have to have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to find such as modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . Gnome is thus functioning , but flu@@ x@@ box will provide for example difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will take a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can check out the file by using in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that creates the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib is cr@@ ashes when reading the meta @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is something mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example , B. &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to lowering the meta @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; when you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable car . turn off if inactive for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in a crash ) . if it is a common crash , and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because a lot of program is writing data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in meta @-@ information , but not character@@ ise the following Perl script . the following Perl script raises the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : dup@@ licate ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : dup@@ licate . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : dup@@ licate
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynam@@ ic playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 more and more active . this is a well known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can fix the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
&quot; if you get this mistake : symbol look@@ up error : &quot; &quot; icon : &quot; &quot; icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ el@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ o@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed using ld@@ d &apos;@@ Im@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ de version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so customize that Amar@@ o@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some options . most installation issues are easiest with the help of an expert your Uni@@ e@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or among developers . they can also use the forum and the IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to seek help . please be there only one error , if you find something about the recovery of an error in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; only a blank playlist is released . how do music pieces come into ?
this is simple . use the file browser to the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start @-@ window was converted into the Statisti@@ cs window . you can find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist the application column , click on the title bar of the playlist and select a column for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok in the background is located . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press un@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just how to make it with other files . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , is the button playlist . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . have a look after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( about the right mouse button ) . also you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that really is true ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence , the actual question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can even support text and PNG de@@ code ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied with MP3 @-@ decoder ( for patent @-@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 KDE , input bar &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s starting : - )
&quot; when you use the G@@ sa S@@ ink to use the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device needs to provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . take a look at the help of D@@ mix for Al@@ sa . &quot;
the issue of this command should help you search for the problems of the problem and help a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may have to specify a different vo@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ oss@@ ary ) .
&quot; this does not do &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must be de@@ enco@@ ded at first . g@@ ou@@ amer is the best choice for most people to hear a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ enco@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ enco@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to al@@ sa , just as x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . opening sound@@ servers with highest priority ( real priority ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
for KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Code@@ cs that can cause loc@@ ating playback . read this bug report . enlarge .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you well .
&quot; either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster art co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; you probably use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less in@@ ert react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers , st@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg before , compile and install it . then delete the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST register again . launch now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot;
please tell you about this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. you will find a complete list of suggestions / wishes you will send it to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ o@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides the name is the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P it is already possible . put an alarm in your Calendar program and leave you with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , runs before you go to bed , then you will have stopped by the rolling tones of the music that you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can I get up to date in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; running tracks when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Play@@ ing &quot;
replace IP @-@ address with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA is available .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; window will be split off . press on it on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size mut@@ able windows . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + Rights click turns a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ le sequence into the queue . by pressing the input bar after a search in the playlist the first search results will be played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and the console appear many error messages . what &apos;s now ? &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; put the CD a , then click on Audio @-@ CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . you can download a few pieces and drag them to the folder folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you can copy files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can insert the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking the right button of the playlist in the playlist window . here , select the evaluation of a piece , just click on the piece and edit : review , select or select F@@ 2 . you can also edit or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit or edit F@@ 2 . &quot;
the developers do not want you to present to you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed publishing plan that will not bring together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok , which can also find some users but quite annoying . disable the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the general settings . &quot;
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create an own . install this then below Amar@@ o@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) , in order to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you monitoring and control of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; , while you are in the Con@@ quer@@ or brow@@ ses . then start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and select the &quot; &quot; Add Amar@@ o@@ ok &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; if you want to use Al@@ sa , please use the latest available version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of stor@@ my and therefore also causes a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok was compiled before you have installed x@@ ins or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you have to configure and install these output modules . you need to configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules do not yet appear yet . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably you use a distribution , which install the development files separately from the actual program . although g@@ ou@@ amer are installed , the necessary development files are missing and the same goes for x@@ ins , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re @-@ compile and install the pack@@ ag@@ ok ; re @-@ compile and install . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ esis that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ stre@@ amer without a pun@@ cture . a tip of Merlin t@@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile am@@ id@@ oth .
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fast installed . &quot;
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer must also be installed the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time installed .
you get the mistake There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator G@@ ST register . then you start Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Amar@@ o@@ ok set up ... audio output type the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ lect 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ b _ type R@@ w h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sub@@ str@@ ates , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the bun@@ ny with sound@@ card support m@@ map . &quot;

&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation field you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and nevertheless even for advanced users power strong enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub@@ windows are later used to detail in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you might think that the lower window will be starting off . the information provided there are now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; moreover , the information provided in the Statisti@@ cal window can be collected ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the window of the window displays information about the straight track , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below , you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this symbol to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information about the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating . &quot;
&quot; to view cover pictures in the context @-@ browser , you have to view cover images in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gif and .@@ pn@@ g are supported , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images that have either been embedded in the cover administration or in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;

&quot; the button editing enables you to edit the lyrics , the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s collection database . &quot;
&quot; the button Search will open a search on goo@@ der@@ .com , following the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece will be displayed directly below the interpre@@ ters . albums or genres are left out . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ter / album - first of course the pieces are arranged according to interpre@@ ter , and among them there will be another division after the album . if you want to see conclusions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to interpre@@ ter , and after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ Name is related . &quot;
group album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
group genre / interpre@@ ter - your pieces are first sorted by genre and below by interpre@@ ter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist . &quot;
with the help of the remaining buttons allows you to adapt and combine the group@@ ing entirely to will .
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; will change your collection automatically again once you have something to select the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
right under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the construction view . references to the use of this filter you will find in the section to the playlist in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter is a selection panel , with which help you can filter the least added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . also , of course , you can also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically switched off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection , you will receive the following options . &quot;
download - This is the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .

the play@@ lists browser is simple to use with many play@@ lists . among other things he also contains more intelligent play@@ lists .
&quot; the lower section of the play@@ lists will include the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database , to create some useful play@@ lists for running time . &quot;

&quot; this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD create , you must have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 &apos;s or other los@@ sy formats , then remember that you &apos;ve retri@@ eving MP3 a worse quality , no matter how much the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy file . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the fuel process . &quot;
this quick instruction will show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps you have to have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and the Qu@@ ell @-@ CD have inserted in the CD @-@ ROM drive .
&quot; for copying a data CD please ex@@ tras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burn . &quot;
&quot; after you have made all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; settings made , please press the button Start . you now see a dialog that looks like or so similar : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window you can track the progress of the copy process . once the entry is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data will be burned down . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Digital audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Pre@@ to Library : O@@ GG Pre@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio co@@ ding and for handling audio data stream . O@@ GG pre benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and Enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported by the MP3 @-@ decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder can compete in the quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Enco@@ der Module .
F@@ LA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der modules so you can read F@@ LA@@ C files and write files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , F@@ LA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ or : other libraries for the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t the WMA files for instance on an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : an aux@@ ili@@ ary program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Enco@@ der Module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you may need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a fully equipped author@@ ise , to edit , dis@@ assemble and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful for adap@@ ting the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different absorption of the various albums will lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that can be played differently according to the various albums . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically restore all videos in the CD @-@ folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialogue Save under will be displayed to select folder and file name for the project file .
save all the open projects . this is the same when you want to save for every single project file .
&quot; if a project changes and has not been saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then leave the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each non @-@ saved project , what should happen , just as if you were called for every project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all open projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and for each non @-@ saved project , what should be done so as if you had called the file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select the relevant dialog files to add to the project . that has the same effect as if you are moving files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the folder folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opening the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the features of the project . the only difference is the added button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different settings , most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session in the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is more likely to be used as a help so that you can see the existing files and folders on the medium .
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remo@@ ves not files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to create a CD @-@ copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD from a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also just want to copy a picture from a CD , which you should then want to copy some CDs with faul@@ ted sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to create a DVD @-@ copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD from a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use the possibility of using a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . besides , there is also the possibility of using a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . furthermore , the target medium has to be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W , allowing you to delete the entire content or part of a CD @-@ R@@ W . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the ty@@ line over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog is burning as a data image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which is then immediately not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported anymore , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously inherited DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previous DVD @-@ Video can be converted to this dialog window . this dialog window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used on the read video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the specified medium . this information is shown in the table view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window will appear . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains a folder of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the table view is activated , its content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives will also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ lock the drive or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; the table view enables you to select and drag files into the project view . the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; switch the head@@ box in the proj@@ ector , or out . the head list is a nar@@ ro@@ wer range , which contains only visible when the proj@@ ector has open projects . the head@@ box has no real function , it looks just pretty , and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the view . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window for changing the keyboard regulations for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furn@@ aces assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions are required for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrators rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can view general programming statements . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and appro@@ ached the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; KDE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality may be controlled for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P function , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . therefore , both programs are crucial in the function of operation , so it &apos;s more likely to offer your taste and type of tasks . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P function , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , all of KDE ; -@@ programs have common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features available to generating new projects . &quot;

K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; audio CD ; is an audio CD ; read for &amp; KDE ; with it , simply audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers who are enco@@ ding these wa@@ v files ( comp@@ ressing compression ) ( comp@@ ressing compression ) ( comp@@ los@@ ers ) . additional co@@ er@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ sy and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
will be compressed in a second step this wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the los@@ ers F@@ LA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not been installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ - ( for O@@ GG ) or other codi@@ fication installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions available , so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything themselves . if for example F@@ LA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required . &quot;
which codi@@ fication / file format will be used ? the chapters of cat@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ ding , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors . &quot;
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not intended to handle any copy of the audio CD ; does not allow the mechanisms of copying them . avoid simply buying a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup must only be done once ( the setup dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , afterwards , the daily approach to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , about which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which codi@@ fication programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB out of the Internet or can work completely without network where all is manually collected .
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step , you will find more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
starts the CD@@ DB request of CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case must first be made connection to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a enco@@ der was configured in the &quot; Auto Settings &quot; tab in the download process - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Enco@@ der , so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the standard . it is to be noted that previously the Enco@@ der was configured in the &quot; &quot; Configuration Settings &quot; &quot; tab . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a already selected file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; stop ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , with different card cards ( such as Enco@@ der , for the setup of the enco@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co @-@ quality and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio @-@ information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; using the audio formats used by data encryption according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided free with most distri@@ butions available , but there are open license issues &quot;
+ high up to very high ton@@ si@@ vity ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG easily deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , disk card , disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - in the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for the audio @-@ quality and the compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting will provide good visibility for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should typically offer for most people and most music pieces , acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rates about 5.5 . needs more and 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ le . good pleasure for music of young people , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ o@@ installations . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without paying attention to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which is manually entered , or managed by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used to create folders and file names as well as the features of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers declare the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ title in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which the audio CDs can read / enter , so that all the others can download such information instead of text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( mention of the UFO ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . all information can be received by the artist or CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you can actively select a cross @-@ mail address ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address will not be used to retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , used to use free@@ DB , ge@@ ographi@@ cally is supposed to be used on the next junction of the network . this saves band@@ width on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of spi@@ ders for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what al@@ read@@ ed program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; those who want to know more precisely in the source code .... it has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first when this has not yet happened .
&quot; for the first opening of the WAV file , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a los@@ ure comp@@ ressing for audio data ) on the tab , and other codi@@ fication can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ tor package needs to be installed on the Linux distribution , before the co@@ ach@@ ers can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined co @-@ operation . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are found in the section cat@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a cont@@ en@@ window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the spelling and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to add both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; and this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; for this example , we will launch the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which of course you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ wed them ( eg ; by trying to copy the Con@@ quer@@ or something inside ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each out and CD ;
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ der of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy to use the program to download the free@@ DB , to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be used by reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the tool @-@ drawing is transferred to the les@@ bian program to allow it to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be specified , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt using the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card @-@ card universal settings . here you can not get much to do . here an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be shown / typ@@ ed as shown in the screenshot .
&quot; only In case of incomplete information , you can select , so that you will be informed if you are missing information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB calcul@@ ator .
&quot; note : the machine needs to be connected to the Internet , so that it can be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately the reading of the CD ; and that is easily dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , they can easily be changed and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example it is further notice : if you want to manually enter all the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this about 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice as if this is worth to download the database . to free@@ DB can be selected , at least the first selection fields have to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how do the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the screen shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and take a look at a mirror server in your vicinity . on this path , the load will be distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equal to the server , but there are many fire@@ walls to boot from 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transfer &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first cross @-@ cross environment should be dis@@ abling .
simply take the settings of screen shot . ( ensure that the folder / tmp is available on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously read pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time only one existing drive ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so just try ourselves . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , let &apos;s throw this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; customised folder for temporary files : if you cross this cross , then the file must be stored in which wa@@ v files are stored . this can not be useful if only the files in the private folder is created . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with wa@@ v files . &quot;
&quot; everything is in place as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the production of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can be deleted if needed . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously to co@@ ding wa@@ v files : at a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to enco@@ ding more than a WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . this configuration is used as default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; it is described on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is described on the disk , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB can be described , must be repeated for each ext@@ end@@ setting &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet available in the free@@ DB , the screenshot is a little different from the data contained for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually transfer them out of the Internet . comments are to indicate the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet happened , it must now be the &amp; CD ; in the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the screen shot . this only , when the &amp; CD , could be identified as audio CD ; and can be identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this is not happening then search in the section questions and answers to help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully picked up by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will pop up , and you can select the database entry that &apos;s your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have selected the cross @-@ box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , you need the access to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : CD @-@ Editor - input of CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . read the title of the piece on the first line of the &apos; Update of &apos; actu@@ ator &apos; containing the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist should no longer be entered into the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment on the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB , the CD Editor is not empty , but it already contains the data like in the following screen shot . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to start the content of the CD Edi@@ tors ( e.g. if all words with big letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option will set up on the tab codes ; take a look at the &apos; Basic settings &apos; tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the created files later any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ans and file formats . see the help for the Ko@@ di@@ tor , in order to get more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select an entry , which is apparent with the style of the ext@@ ingu@@ ishing CD ; agre@@ es . in this example , this is not important as we do not send the &amp; CD ; data anyway , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example can be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD @-@ Edi@@ tors appears and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire . &quot;
click on the next line on the main window and in the same way you entered the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB folder . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that it has a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles which are marked are selected . a simple click on the line turns out the selection of the piece , or press the button All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen , to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button choice of the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the on @-@ on board to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the kno@@ bs of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error , you see if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : contract 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and enco@@ ding parallel . note the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration option to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the result of parallel processes for reading and enco@@ ding . in high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous read and co@@ ding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will pop up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create a primitive audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , is maintained today within the &amp; KDE ; CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are using CVS , you can download from there an anonymous package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; KDE package . if you are reading this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compile data files , and are not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to get the options and settings . it displays screenshot of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu was stopped after the first start of the program , without any clue as it is supposed to go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from unusual brief menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look something like that : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author is not intended to add or change this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you want to read it , it is only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agree with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange when it succeeded to get the source file from &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; M@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; KDE ; . besides other he did not have real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke e@@ cho@@ ic@@ ked and some features that do not have any other &amp; Unix ; MIDI players will not have .
&amp; M@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; KDE ; support also the &amp; Linux ; ultras@@ onic proj@@ ector needed for CIS cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&quot; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic presentation of the activity of any MIDI channel through high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; KDE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window to KM@@ id can be pulling .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( property events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you end &amp; KDE ; during the playing of a song , it starts the next time with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can choose Open@@ ing ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; c@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; M@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; cli@@ de window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played one another . )
&quot; once &amp; M@@ mid , a piece plays out , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the shelves . &quot;
&quot; when you find that a song goes too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and so change the playback speed . to re @-@ click the original pace , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry in the menu item , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved on two kinds in a piece of music . some pieces use texture , others use lyrics and another both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; M@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be represented and even better : the E@@ ign@@ ist@@ ype will automatically determine which one song is used , so you will automatically change the kar@@ aoke text . however , you will still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; in case you want to set an event type , select from the menu settings the entries . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ izes . this section will be played in this section as you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ize ... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the desired effect on the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not saved . concerns that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it needs to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the button . it will be in turn the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece is automatically added to the opening ( using file Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if Autom@@ atically add to the collection , it is activated , when opening a piece is activated , then the collection will be added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select The series after the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in sequence as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop@@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to move a song further , select the next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter when it is saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that understands the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all the events of Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , and thus always make a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you just have a sound card , you do not need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl@@ . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . therefore , you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which saves all the required re@@ aliz@@ ations for the play of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section should only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , is that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine will be used to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not have any line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ keyboard To M is needed to put all notes that this instrument will need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , do not support a gun ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which can be similar to a gun . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with a patch 127 ( tissue infection ) , it accepts a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is the term Dru@@ el patch of the patch , with which every sound is a different percus@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is the tone of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how notes on a particular channel or instrument are illustrated .
&quot; as with the p@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple keyboard for each channel and each instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the percussion channel . see for example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you simply make the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the keyboard option , the key@@ map uses the name used for this channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map needs to be used further in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , it is always used patch x . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is multip@@ lied in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to stand in the map file ( no dec@@ imal income ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM indicates that a key@@ board , which is to play a Pit@@ ch player , with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the can@@ oe view is a window with a whole series of Kla@@ vi@@ aturen ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these Kla@@ vi@@ aturen you will see what sounds are played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is an exit list , where you have changed an instrument , the button does not use more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to indicate the played notes . view in the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so this can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone , &amp; c@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control of everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen when you have a bin@@ der distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid . this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support has been compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from C@@ mid ; &apos;s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree to support &amp; c@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window &quot;
&quot; before you enable the setting of automatic addition to the collection , otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the reproduction . to restore the standard pace , you can double click on the LCD double . &quot;
I have on one &amp; KDE ; -@@ desktop a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI Fol@@ der and &amp; Cas@@ mid ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I &apos;d like to move a file only into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window and draw the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file without adding them straight to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so make the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then un@@ lock yourself to record B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me that , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; I was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I am in the third year , so I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies but I try to collect a bit of time for my hob@@ bies but I try to earn some MIDI files , music and prove sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; c@@ mid , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ cus@@ .@@ es &quot;

a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio device or an A@@ we card .
if you do not have sound@@ card you need to compile &amp; c@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound@@ card except that you can of course listen to music .

&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . op@@ tionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be shown when information is given in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to store the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you copy an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it is not possible to select the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , but also by application itself . by clicking on a sub@@ folder , the XML contents of this part will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after modification of XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu with a playlist and either selected the editing mode , or another category will be selected . &quot;
all changes are lost when the editing mode left or another group will be selected without using the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation at startup and end can be de@@ activated by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ able option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted simply . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however this would be disturbing during the end animation , but the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a startup animation may be the ads of a favorite pictures : lt ; he@@ als ; he@@ als ; he@@ d@@ unge@@ e = &quot; &quot; meet , &quot; &quot; * / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif . &quot;
&quot; there is a rider for the configuration of the M@@ players in the configur@@ ations dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the M@@ player and the inter@@ changeable size of the dat@@ enst@@ ro@@ ms can be adjusted from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the &quot; console &quot; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ box , just like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order to restore the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module is stated as service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setting of KDE file . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages concerning the store of the browser module . the gest@@ ed process means p@@ umping player . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output is set within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a pre @-@ made back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ mate : &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play by TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this will need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be installed , the scanner can be used for easy @-@ to @-@ use device and the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Rec@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is selected in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be detected ports for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only can use X@@ video , this type of playing video equipment should work under Linux the only thing works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server has to be functional in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally are used by SM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , open source , pi@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when activated , they begin with the playback of the playlist . &quot;
are there references as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after connecting the device . it is imperative to point out that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts only slowly on how each time my CPU needs to be tested for their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ pin will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for the compile of &amp; ki@@ le ;
&quot; l@@ atex ; : a professional font application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be used on the package &amp; text live , respectively &amp; te@@ Te@@ X ; ( for older systems ) . &quot;
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD must be drawn . &quot;
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages by &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions available . these allow easy installation without further compile and are included on the ki@@ le website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users will hardly need to read this manual . however , all proposals on the documentation must be taken into account . if the support for this project or the documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the ki@@ le ; website . &quot;
&quot; questions to or while comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; on or extensions desired , this should be addressed on the ma@@ iling list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; KDE ; -@@ desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility for use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and customised tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities should be drawn to Kate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can be directly connected to the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate .
&quot; for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . alert the original &amp; tex ; hard to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ e. L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is also possible that it is derived from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; in this case , there is only a good condition to view &amp; l@@ atex ; given it is not the ultimate book on it . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : Docum@@ ent preparation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; similarly as other mark@@ ers , includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the most common properties such as paper format , lateral en@@ umeration and text types begins with the command \ \ document@@ aries , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } , and must be closed again with the command \ \ } { document } . &quot;
the rapid @-@ level assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a good function for the rapid development of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; it offers some possibilities for the preparation of the document . it can also be done some of the document related settings .
&quot; document : this is the type of document document : article &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; proj@@ ector &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Editor &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
co@@ ding : hereby the string enco@@ ding is set . it should be used to use the enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard .
this list offers the most used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; . for the involvement they will only be selected in the cross @-@ box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : documentation of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN rules ) . &quot;
new users are now unable to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and more detailed information to this issue are given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment time and more . &quot;
&quot; with automatic renewal of environments , in case of entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { Command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically create a space ( for the input of the text ) and the additional line for typ@@ ing settings ( such as \ \ . { Command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ type the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse @-@ click on the respective . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful for cleaning purposes . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ many sk@@ ate file , navig@@ ating &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking on the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the file l@@ atex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contained a description of the format document and also other information as the font and is adjacent to PDF the media output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools to view , transformation and print of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and ways . &quot;
&quot; when using the rod @-@ search , the elements of the DVI ; file is shortened by the editor and click on an item in the DVI ; file file , it is printed on a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code file , is used in the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ Docum@@ ent : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master &apos;s document the work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project can set a project @-@ wide Master document to project settings .
fast @-@ construction : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the sourc@@ ec@@ ode ) .
&quot; file maintenance : in this mode the DVI ; file on the qu@@ int@@ unt@@ â , of the factory , and it is not a call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after the fast @-@ building . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the edit tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ wers inside the document should go to the document . the first selection field is designed for quick classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the air@@ field More is for example of articles such as tags , fox , notes or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a designation for a section , a picture or other element will be created . &quot;
reference : is used to set the reference to a fixed name ( select a selection panel ) .
using c@@ itation there will be a drop@@ down list with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ vor@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; written by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down field with the name gr@@ Ã &apos;@@ e is used for setting up the fonts . it may be set to the Fon@@ ts , the Fu@@ sions , notes etc . , there are the following fonts : &quot;
at the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices for linking : 1 . assistant to create a new document by selecting the document art and festivals of the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up by hand .
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ aries contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; puts the fonts to the command , this may also be fixed in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code is entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code has to be compiled . the easiest way for this is the use of the construction sector or the button . &quot;
the code does not have to be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; the storage is automatically saved .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document out of mis@@ use should be sought in the log@@ ging after the errors . when using cl@@ amping , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be noticed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the Fon@@ dation Group e 12 created and only a few loops should have a different fonts , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ . &quot;
the changes are only used within the area ( by \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ . } ) . there is no sei@@ zur@@ es ( number ) for the bodies within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for the read@@ ability of the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , there may be certain fonts , fat pressure , sub@@ cut@@ ters , sub@@ missions , etc . those commands may either end up with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is available for cur@@ ator and is so long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a proposition can be illustrated with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : creates a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; l@@ atex ; recording language was represented , now follows a step @-@ step guide to the preparation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once in the assistant a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . there should be a quotation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ ator and a poem for the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , can be added to the editor using Editor , or Str@@ g E ( in internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be shut down . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer are created . there are many different types of .d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ts or computer screens . &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly adjusted ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is created , converting other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ search yiel@@ ded the direct jump from the editor to the appropriate position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; bin@@ ds . only Modern under settings can set up ... tools are selected .
&quot; to carry out the steps , the mouse @-@ cursor is positioned in a row of the source code and attached to pre @-@ search results . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then performed . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; open and used to the corresponding line . &quot;
&quot; should there be no mistake when using fast @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewers can no longer occur . should there be an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log file can be used for the error source in the source code . in the editor , the buttons can always be used in the errors . to click on the faul@@ ty line , the log file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used to select the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a new document , a document may be written either by scratch or the assistant to create a new document . additional information about this can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; are users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; ki@@ le ; templates , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file opened , or a new file created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using the setting of an existing document and select file templates . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document out of a template using a file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string enco@@ ding ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering into documentation . typically it is used as follows : \ document@@ ate class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and therefore the orders status in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been carried out : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the template can be selected instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any kind of file l@@ atex ; files created . an easy way to create a template , should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; col@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and her@@ es@@ ying of many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) can be made out of the menu tools directly from &amp; ki@@ le .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate , and to experience its possibilities , the manual should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can be found directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command preference which can be called over the menu of La@@ Te@@ X @-@ reference . it offers an output description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double click with dr@@ Ã © Str@@ g button to balance the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way when clicking \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is only \ \ par .
&quot; when pulling the text with penetr@@ ated left mouse button , the chosen text is automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , you can taste parts of the source code in the Edi@@ tor@@ window . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; the possibility to browse the most varied types of source code and to highlight this . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants , You can agree with your book@@ marks . this is a special kind of book@@ marks within the text . this is also highlighted the leap for the most common or last jumping brand . this jump @-@ stamp is also highlighted , so that it is automatically added with the first input of a sign . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; k@@ ate , has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source code will always contain many environments and groups , and therefore support their choice . in editing you may include the following commands : &quot;
&quot; indicate a complete paragraph ( group of lines that included on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph there is not a text which is included in other lines of text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore that the lines are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
lets the word under the current Cur@@ sor@@ position . this selection has also an extended meaning as this command also &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with a rod sti@@ cking ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end of the weekend .
&quot; for example , a part of the document can be separated from this first and by dr@@ ink@@ cken C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line will be removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers its own commands this for a faster delivery . under editing , the following commands may include : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the Edi@@ ting Ret@@ ard@@ in paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for further further orders under editing environment for an additional work with &amp; l@@ atex ; &quot;
with this command is placed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the host of the environment .
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the Fin@@ ds of the surroundings . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is in front or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many inde@@ xed ambient commands , the command can be lost quickly . this command Fin@@ ally which is not least of the most beautiful environment , so that the prescri@@ ptions of the ambient structure is not possible . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ groups which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
with this command is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the busi@@ est cl@@ amps .
&quot; with this command , the end of the current group will be spra@@ yed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the br@@ aces of the cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the s@@ wollen cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is lower@@ ed ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the entry of many s@@ wollen groups @-@ br@@ aces , groups @-@ brackets can be lost quickly to the glance . this command Fin@@ ally of the last mentioned group , so that the vei@@ led structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not batt@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; two easy steps are used as a service for example . for the purpose of purpose the sign is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple an@@ ages &quot; &quot; is used for this case and for two cl@@ amping gro@@ wers : for . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this automatic transmission sign can be set up under settings &quot; &quot; Ki@@ le &quot; &quot; ... La@@ Te@@ X - and be sign@@ posted . &quot;
it can also be used for specific settings ( such as n@@ german or a ) and thus German or fran@@ chis@@ eling signs . there are also many more languages available .
&quot; if the current position is located within a lists of Shift , Invent@@ ory , and ki@@ le ; an intelligent poin@@ ter is located . in case the current position within a lists of lists ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , not only a poin@@ ter but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within one tables of Fin@@ ally , t &amp; ki@@ le ; the present line with \ \ \ \ with a close to the foref@@ ront of po@@ inters . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ arranged &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this can be found under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
&quot; some users would like to arrange the columns in tables and thereby each E@@ t sign ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; seek this to be fulfilled , according to the most common tab@@ ulator in the present row . although this t@@ ulator is not the case , for the columns of the current table . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate , it has already been extended to include a good source code , it has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for l@@ atex ; ) . all of these modes can be set up for different ways of working among settings . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; the last letter of the input will be removed and allows the final letter list . on the other hand , the list of entering a further letter can also be smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are easily transmitted by selecting a command . alternatively , the descriptions can be frozen , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible through to edit the spr@@ ite jumping brand . &quot;
&quot; setting settings ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings may be made to these lists . there may be different types of versions for these lists . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is available for the completion of environments . there is always a few letters associated with \ \ begin , and the call for complete mode is used as often , that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode is used for understanding the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete mode to the menu , the menu bar or the but@@ ton@@ ing Alt + Shift key , the command will be automatically collected and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient temperature continues to be finished in the simplest way and will be finished by the input of the input . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list of the lists , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; setting settings ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings may be made to these lists . this mode uses the possibility of comp@@ action mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ orders . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of re@@ treats which will immediately be replaced by means of winding chains . as an example of a retri@@ eval list the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word fully introduced to the menu mode , or the keyboard mode , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; gro@@ oms are not helpful for automatic communication methods . however , it has been noted that many people in a document can be written more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the enti@@ rety for all already written W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu settings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ te . here , the sw@@ ell@@ ant can also be set for the display of inter@@ change . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / copy / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode is available for &quot;
the dialogue graphics are designed and designed by graphics as simple as possible . to preserve the basics of the basics of graphic formats should be the sections and notice .
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but they offer an excellent basis for domestic and new orders from pages . if the PDF file allows you to log into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf can be converted into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to solve the results of work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ing in the menu creation comp@@ iling , creating and create . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer such as &amp; oc@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further transformation can be used the but@@ ary ; file in the standard to be changed by the old ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and be viewed using old ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
&quot; when using the commands , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . should not be used in a built @-@ in viewer , then each new window will be added . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project &apos;s new project .... the following information for the project will be asked :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the output of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API @-@ scripts are not developed yet and can be found in further versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first of all must be said that the execution of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a rather balanced system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the users .
&amp; te@@ Te@@ X ; and &amp; texts are delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; l@@ atex ; reference .
&quot; a complete refer@@ ential refer@@ ee &amp; tex ; and it is not just described by a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather , it is ideal for a certain form of form@@ atting . as this is a very large part of this document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; te@@ Te@@ X ; / tex@@ as , the final document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; te@@ Te@@ X ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which provides a database with all too &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered in documents and this for a graphical environment . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for par@@ c@@ esses or stro@@ kes . then only the results are shown .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the an@@ tigen of spaces for the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ qu@@ ered and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; source system for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix systems is available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix systems ; also available on &amp; Mac ; also installed on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .

&quot; this application is expected to find an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if not , then remove the current work folder . if not , then remove the current work folder and enter the folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time when the pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , anyone who has been working on the &amp; KDE documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the straight opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply release the current work folder . if not , then select the current folder folders and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
when it comes to a output on the screen it is faul@@ ty . please check the errors reported and try again .
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then it &apos;s attached to the current file . if not , delete them in the current file and select the files using a different file - file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed audi@@ ting selection . &quot;
&quot; for the use of an &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified in the &amp; D@@ TD ; file , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) ; file sel@@ ector . for both the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; file sel@@ ector , as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review , is required by definition of the definition @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;

&quot; if the file should be selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file should simply be selected . if not , remove the actual file and select the file to be processed using the other file file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; type the name of the file , as the result will have been named , and the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; may have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even though , the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately . you can use the plug @-@ in in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we begin to edit plug @-@ ins plug @-@ ins . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new solutions . we describe every &amp; GUI ; element in it :
&quot; here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project features and dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and is used to identify unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project like both team manager and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of te@@ amm@@ ite members who he is . this is done by pressing the team member from the list and the button appears as expresses . the currently selected member ( her identi@@ ties ) appears after which you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and notes . see further information on notes .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by the recording of the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team manager when something happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when a certain specific project happens when a file is secured , or sending a message when a file is secured , or a script that a file is added to CVS once it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alog@@ es can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an e @-@ mail will be sent to the selected address list in the recipi@@ ents . the Ad@@ dress can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see how such heads are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
remarks : it may be chosen either the note message from the Editor @-@ Con@@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment range followed by note speakers .
&quot; notes may be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax is the nickname of the team member , role played a role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager Sub@@ project leaders , according to the sub@@ missions and sub@@ project leaders , as stated in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roles names are independent of large or small par@@ aphr@@ ase , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , which is D@@ TD @-@ agn@@ os@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by clicking on the Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that can be dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in terms of tags including car delivery can thus be modified . the entries are :
large / mini@@ ature of tags : large / mini@@ ature of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / to@@ graphy means the tags become as inserted as they are described in the day @-@ to @-@ day XML files .
large / mini@@ ature of attributes . normal wholesale / to@@ graphy means that attributes become as inserted as they are described in the day @-@ to @-@ day XML files .
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if done , it is optional for tags , for which the end tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ off and finish @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the end @-@ end tag will be changed and vice @-@ versa . &quot;
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding code during the typ@@ ing .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s to detect different types of files . using the button standard can restore the default ones .
&quot; standard string enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created files or in other way as with file opening files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be transferred ) , but this setting will be cancelled from the same in the proj@@ ector , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not recognized , but this setting is provided by the same in the proj@@ ector , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that in a power failure or crash the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even if not saved documents , a backup will be done regularly , according to the time issued . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editing area or a separate view ( or documentation in a box of card ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the standard at the next start is useful when the user interface by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend of views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the feed@@ backs -@@ section serves the taxes on the possibility of turning the ad of warnings through an@@ gled off of non @-@ questions .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code mode in the distributed mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural @-@ tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document to be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural settings , the visibility of node in the tree can be automatically opened to editing , and how deep in a change of the structure tree will be automatically opened , empty knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found where there is no element in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area to commemor@@ ate abbrevi@@ ations ( some kind of templates ) which are un@@ developed by editing to a wide @-@ ranging text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ uss abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins can be managed by plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third page , which can be used by any part @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , it must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard there such as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be passed to the plugin when you start , then it can open the current file to the directory ( path of the current file ) or the folder folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . it allows you to save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the bug search was completely new developed . th@@ ief for the no longer necessary in PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger is dis@@ continued , as well as the support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead of this , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; added . &quot;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the button options next to the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in box you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if for a project a debu@@ gger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appear in the left Dock .
&quot; a view , where all the brackets , with hands @-@ numbers and conditions are listed . normally , appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger is all or part of the following functionality available .
&quot; this action is the connection to the debu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with them to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ese . this action is set by default , if a project is used , which normally does not need to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to debu@@ gging session Star@@ te the meeting . close the connection to the debu@@ gger or end the sounds .
send a HTTP request to the server by a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view debu@@ gger issue .
&quot; points the debu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitoring variables as well as the current line date . when this happens , the execution continues . happens before a debit requirement is started , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; points the debu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , without any information about monitoring variables and the current poin@@ ter number . when this happens , the execution goes on . it happens before a debit requirement is given , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is placed . &quot;
the debu@@ gger is running the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the debu@@ gger leads the next directive on the script , whereby if possible in functions and include errors . &quot;
&quot; points the debu@@ gger to ski@@ p the directive and to go to the next , as if there were the current one . &quot;
&quot; opening a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , super@@ vised . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog a variable can be entered , or a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; KDE ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that you can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to suit your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to become better . &quot;
&quot; document@@ ty@@ p Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; make your simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script @-@ languages and family 2 , the script @-@ oriented boxes , and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files are included in two parts , the tag directory and the tool@@ bars ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how equ@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags and the layout and content of the sender , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it contains a fast inser@@ ting tags in a document without the danger of a letter defect . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder bear the name of the label language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so many users have better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is set out in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a daily XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element of type itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; An argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the day class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only for the type of type is valid . is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute and attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag is determined by the text . this is a only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can occur only once for each attribute . it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains additional tags that will describe how this attribute is supposed to be shown &amp; etc . this is a only element type element .
is the source @-@ filling used for the attributes in the day @-@ editing dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ level and a method name . the arguments to be passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container @-@ day included the elements of a list together . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is a only element element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags inside a dialog . this day can occur in a dialog only once for each attribute ( e.g. once for each one ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each one ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the required tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements to finish one day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; declaration shall begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be tidy and closed properly .
&quot; these should affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools will start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to be followed . &quot;
&quot; this function is not currently available . currently , the check is only at the charging of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML @-@ file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the Dat@@ in@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML @-@ file is intended to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for this , accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ ded D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; Version = U@@ ML@@ 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C , / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can be defined by setting actions ... click on New action to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the button &quot; &quot; User button &quot; &quot; button can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with sound the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest promotions . it can be inserted into the Det@@ a@@ ili@@ ated settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est shareholder type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start -@@ dialog , or the different see ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be stated . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified path@@ es are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps /
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text uniqu@@ ely added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the listed methods , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default input , you can claim what is to send to the default one . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only recommended with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the introduced application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output , written on the standard output . it can be specified if the text is written on the standard output of the text , by the value the selected field is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in a given case , it &apos;s not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure actions . select configuration actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts to edit mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add it to the suitable tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and if the day attributes has and you are planning their use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; edit &quot; , &quot; if available , so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have trouble .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; do not choose from the menu @-@ menu ; , graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; and ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also all the other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly interpreted as los , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user to be sign@@ aled ; to start the symbol in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it needs to be associated with the action . this happens via the menu with attitudes actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ) ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue it with other tags , so there is still , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want to complement some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should set it a better overview of some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bars to setup settings on settings tool . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I would like to choose the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to see a quick way of accessing the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by checking all icons , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; if Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be used as root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder ( s ) , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ atting language you like most . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository check if someone has done this for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to let the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you to the second we treat here .
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations , e.g. , Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = € 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = convention 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = convention 3.@@ html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can see it now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is such a thing :
&quot; # KDE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc t = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = In@@ tro@@ duction = Cur@@ x.@@ html ... &quot;
note the # in front of Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this shows that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border to the shaft alignment ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consistent at the top end of the tree @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
space affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources are replaced .
&quot; the section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for designing a context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script indicate the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file mandatory line . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by Be@@ ist@@ rich separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file just a $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@
&quot; when you are sure that this is good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; you are not alone . it is possible to share the dis@@ crete resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places , there will be an email address given by email , tool@@ bars tool@@ bar , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users will be checked and only made available when our team needs them as correct and useless for publishing , we recommend the resources of resources , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; in the up@@ loading you will be asked after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you may need multiple keys you may need to stay . in a dialog new resource you need to stay filled in the dialog box ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can upload and upload the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the in@@ toxic@@ ity of the resource is warning , and it can then be cancelled . please check the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message will appear with the specification of the resource of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages that is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; but creation may be time consuming because hundreds of day files can be necessary in the day XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD load and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards the following dialog will appear :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition command : the string that will appear in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ d@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; default of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and make full benefit of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , this chapter is to give them close to these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved , available . by tool@@ bars about actions , everything is marked as global , in common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved , this enables the group of administrators different tool@@ bars , promotions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web applications for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are em@@ bodied in the folder tree of the project , indicating the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the builders , the cart@@ on board with information and the tool@@ bars . please enter in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click with the right button of the mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , re@@ charge , delete , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or version of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the Edi@@ tor@@ area lead to another context menu on the revised document , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing of the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , if the string is placed under the mouse cursor or opening the file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editing pane are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional is shown as default for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , such as &amp; lt ; then click the icon that includes the tag , then you can insert the data for this just inserted day ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with cart@@ on board are available for files , project , sample templates , documentation , scrip@@ ting , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , prepared . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the manage files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as add , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program components , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates are available only in the project and templates . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can call the available information on a script . more information on the right mouse button are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with email . &quot;
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking of an element it is set to the cursor in the document on the position of the element . it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other building views . with it you can change some quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . that &apos;s on the content of this application system allows modification of all available attributes with few clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ pack@@ aged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create your own documentation , and add a folder to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ els lead at the bottom of the window , via the useful information can be reached : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this card @-@ story shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD appear .
&quot; this card @-@ cool@@ ed shows all the bugs in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ ate of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with your mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a comp@@ ressing T@@ ar archive , and sent them into an email ; like any other secure and load it ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check whether your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a swift web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , began to deal with an underlying idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up languages would have ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now it is widely on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . together : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is the suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; KDE ; developer community is based on what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to bro@@ aden how they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows you to improve productivity by using an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by means of compos@@ ing they can keep them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add it to you without any scripts . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file that is not set to it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project device , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts to inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters to the &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to add &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day . &quot;
&quot; blocking or off . this allows you to select text blocks , with the help of &amp; Shift . &quot;
goes directly to a row number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script messages out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not an end . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
&quot; bur@@ ner and switching of the problem @-@ porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window . the problem @-@ re@@ porter gets activated as soon as you move to the structural tree . &quot;
displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; when there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries for previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory according to new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy graphic files to your project folders or a sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
invites the files to your project to the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , projects you will find the details explained . &quot;
download a project @-@ workshop bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only used in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions should be stored by means of settings . tool@@ bars are stored via tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not del@@ etes them from the hard disk . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to anyone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ) team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows up@@ loading tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own label format .
&quot; invite the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; up to renew . if this is global and is not present a write permission in the global KDE folder , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . when the standard ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day @-@ setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; enabled or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this means only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar is denied , if this day is contradic@@ ted to the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plugins are listed below the above @-@ mentioned menu items . click here . click on an activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
select the syn@@ onym mode for the current file . the list of available schem@@ atics depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version ab .
select the type of poin@@ ter passwords . very useful when you know people the other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
verification of the syntax of the current document according to the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; via the external application of tidy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause the det@@ ects sometimes time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the default mode , which is also the default mode , or the default mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open window frames . with a selection of a single entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
turn the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog influences each application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &quot; &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
&quot; displays the behavior of the editing pane . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , you find details . &quot;
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which to add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help according to the user &apos;s environment , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; lus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product free available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from above , as after filling out the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . in entering the name it is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository .
&quot; here , there is the server address of the machine to which you want to access , one , unless you have processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ unprecedented .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log is used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host could be an adaptation required . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a joint collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard tool@@ bars . if a joint collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . there are multiple files or all folders selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let those files that are located somewhere in the root folder of the project , are to be included in the main folder of the project . if a project is started to re @-@ start , not An@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact choice after paint . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by tap or , by removing the bun@@ ny , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
&quot; the latest screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simplify your work . these options can upload in the menu with project properties in the menu button profiles , or with the short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ eholders ) can be re@@ inv@@ oked in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supple@@ mentary option to the above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded at the opening of the project , can be read more about proj@@ ect@@ views . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in this case , troubles@@ hooting can be described . &quot;
&quot; profile profiles can upload high @-@ profile profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree @-@ view for the contents of the server for each profile , showing its own user @-@ view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch action actions and add this actions , change or delete . event transactions are executed , as a previously certain event occurs , such as the si@@ ll of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behavior can not be influenced at present . &quot;
to open a different project to open project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder acts as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of the top @-@ run files . see &quot;
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only more a profile is available , the button will decrease , in order to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will keep in the memory , and forget with you . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the more in@@ secure password on the disk does not come in question . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transmission , or simply leave the dialog if you want to change your opinion before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ profile profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . editing , or creating a profile will display this dialog : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work . &quot;
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate so it can not simply be read , but everyone can easily see in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a proj@@ ector is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . in a project , there can be a lot of views , i.e. by simply ex@@ changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened or deleted in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings , tool@@ ing project tool@@ bar . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most of them . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method .
&quot; as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which is best made using the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be set to either by means of context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar , can remove other actions such as tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar , or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries will remove action and displayed action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings , set up ... and set settings . &quot;
&quot; templates are essentially document@@ ari@@ ette , code sub@@ cut@@ lets and files for bon@@ y . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates as a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any one to the system available directory in the pre @-@ center tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you specify for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template introduced right before use .
&quot; binary templates is all that is not pure text . it may be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . &quot;
documents can be created from any text document . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . it is a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . see for more information about the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information about the templates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole Web sites are used as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project window ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the pre@@ conditions under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File , as a template store your selection as local / project situation . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and derivatives on the tree @-@ view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only possible to copy the file system . it can be used for all file formats , such as pulling and derivatives or inser@@ ting the file tree of Con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files , select a folder to the right and secure website template . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates makes a very pur@@ pose@@ ful anticip@@ ation . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically using &amp; PHP ; to create files or link with them . in addition , you can keep some things with the use of templates in projects very deep in the eye . &quot;
the device structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files created in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps /
&quot; to set the behavior of an folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog will be published : &quot;
&quot; a selection panel with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is deduc@@ ted as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes are ver@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the regul@@ ators in general view . if a root folder would be dis@@ abling , it would be explicitly activated in this path . in case of normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allowed set or set text for templates in this folder . this could be general header or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents into a folder with special header lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already using the appropriate header / foot@@ lines .
&quot; in addition , you have a menu @-@ menu ( pointing right , press right button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor who are accessible via the menu View . the first mode will replace the source editor in two parts : the sourc@@ ec@@ ode Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch to the source code in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the sourc@@ ec@@ ode are visible .
&quot; in working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document which contains &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ default of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit these directly with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly using the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that simultaneously the changes are both in the sourc@@ ec@@ ode Editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor visible and the cursor in the Source Editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor visible , this mode is already active , the button pressure the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation level between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the sourc@@ ec@@ ode Editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; view can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation : a small microphone for quick calcul@@ ator and a large fix@@ ation for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the use of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be inv@@ oked as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor will be created . this is where you can change the following documents : &quot;
&quot; meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword &apos;s key words on the content of the column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing the look of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is possible exactly as with the meta @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style device by pressing on the file , pressing the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sors is as described in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is as usual . the selection works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and can be deleted by feed@@ backs or removal . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is carried out in the same way over the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor day is inserted , each other surrounding anchor has to be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the read@@ sheets or the lists assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used the tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for style property the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style situation can be pro@@ secuted .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to compile successfully except &amp; KDE ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ als , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ als and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available for a typical installation of &amp; KDE . &quot;
&quot; stopping at a template , at a place in a file loaded , or x@@ ml file or on the current k@@ not . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , brack@@ et can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without wr@@ apping . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded music file loaded with relative path to the same folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded as an altern@@ ate file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , displayed on a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNAP ME or a specified modul@@ us name . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace stated in the given &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be extended according to the rules which are pre@@ defined by the X@@ SL &apos;s source file : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a gr@@ assy brack@@ et must be dis@@ solved for the UR@@ I and Zei@@ lers number . this will automatically be evaluated at the store of the first template using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . hal@@ low points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each drive .

several commands may require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument becomes a brack@@ et in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes and at the same time it had corrected many places in the same file . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts throughout the conflict . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the one changed . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the text as soon as possible , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made lots of work , was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly to a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way interaction is fully supported . this is useful when two people are working independently of each other on a piece of co@@ de and changes the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files in joining together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and co @-@ operation of complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the folder inter@@ connects :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and deals with the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently have to check Ko@@ de you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ulators are visible . if lines only appear in a certain number of white characters you can see it at a glance at the left in the column at the left . ( no hass@@ le more if someone changes the one . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in a line then the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make use of the typ@@ ing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder folders
&quot; opening dialog enables manual setting of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or select a least open file from the drop @-@ down file . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file when you run the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files . &quot;
&quot; click on the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or inter@@ connecting of folders will be selected , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; col@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A into the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if together , the input field is active for the target and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to set up an output file immediately . you can also do this step later in stores . &quot;
the setup -@@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the compar@@ isons .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all the file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allowing you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialogue you do not have to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use pulling and derivatives : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over an comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to load only two corresponding files , put them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply copy , insert and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t pull out of &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop is supported by text into a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and desc@@ ending from text into another program as cut and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B , or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the row number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C optional ) , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small Help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sourc@@ ec@@ ters are assigned to the characters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this pres@@ ets can be changed over the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default colour is different . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( together ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text there is the summar@@ izing column . when differences have been found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , e.g. white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare items . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summar@@ ize column from the text , is interrupted on the positions where the respective source file has no lines . if the line file is activated , the line is dot@@ ted to reverse lines . &quot;
&quot; results window ( among the comparison ) also has a info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains the automatic interaction already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to a next deleted / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts ) . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , every difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking the left mouse button in one of the windows the group of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group is not visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left hand a black beam .
sometimes it is left by automatic merge or by manual editing no further line more in the group ; then it is shown in these lines of the text ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you may change your opinion and maybe add another source . this text doesn &apos;t appear either in the final file ; still in a selection that you might copy and add elsewhere .
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ ized conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options display or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the cap@@ turing and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , top , end , tr@@ l @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w , like you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Augsburg window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between feed and over@@ charging mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as previously stated in the section &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture above / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture above / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or the next / previous conflict continue to be conflict as a conflict . therefore , between the solved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ ting ) . there is also the option selection automatically copying . however , if this option is activated , you will be automatically over@@ written in the cli@@ p@@ board . be careful with this option , because you could terminate the content of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally . &quot;
&quot; poin@@ ter are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are not using a poin@@ ter characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems using Wagen@@ re \ \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line of source code files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries files . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( set menu option - &gt; Diff@@ user ) ... )
&quot; select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in recur@@ sively script . if the chosen script does not support this presentation does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be ast@@ ered . on these systems the button settings automatically represents an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , when the inser@@ tion of the tablet button is inserted the corresponding number of whit@@ esp@@ ace . otherwise a t@@ um@@ ulator is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press the input or return , the default line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which poin@@ ter type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; at the compar@@ ing of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white characters will not be ignored . in this step white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car @-@ back sign &apos; \ \ &apos; and a poin@@ ter &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others simply save a line run sign , but then files may be activated with different sizes in side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but then files may be disabled . in default , this option has to be de@@ activated . in default this option is down@@ lighted . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is down@@ lighted . in the first part of the analysis you will be ignored numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . the differences are nevertheless indicated , but they are treated as white characters . &quot;
in default this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
&quot; intensive searches for even smaller differences . this option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective at complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atically @-@ continuing mode , this setting will determine how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files , then use better the functions constitu@@ ent A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the conflict menu . note that the Autom@@ atic selection includes conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning , folders and transmission . take a look for details under documentation for directory comparison and connection . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , the original version exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it is deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must end and rest@@ art , so that the change is active in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available , because the language is set up global over the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you select this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
on the selection fields for the enco@@ ding appears a short notice of what the local co@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal nature . )
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . since the enco@@ ding is adjustable for each file individually , even files can be compared and merged with different co@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have worked a file , you can specify which co@@ ding should be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define process commands , they may not function with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can handle only 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the enco@@ ding of the issu@@ ing of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off in order to supp@@ ress Her@@ vor@@ ing of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ view . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences are shown in a color co@@ ded over@@ si@@ le column . but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal or a second over@@ si@@ tional column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
submit the comparison window to each other or over@@ l@@ one another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide to bring down the files together . a simple click starts operation and then use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the latest source file as a pre @-@ named name for the output file . ( if this function is used to launch the connec@@ table file then the name of the least used output file will be retained . )
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred first to this external command . in &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command will be visible and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut bot@@ her@@ ing parts or to correct the inhal@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred first to this external command . the output of the command will only be used with the command command . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have an appropriate output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility to setup the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users want to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases , or per@@ l are completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for poin@@ ter to convert into big letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s sub@@ string refers to the found text in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .

&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built feature in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for poin@@ ter . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; each of the sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform multiple attempts at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; However , per@@ l requires some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be for display and con@@ co@@ operations . the further operations only change the data that is seen from the line @-@ off al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the poin@@ ter @-@ pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor @-@ commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can not notice certain differences not notice and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge . &quot;
... makes up a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... &quot; can simul@@ ate the conflict and displays the simul@@ ated changes , without using it really , &quot;
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ;
this is very similar to the same and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not run the interaction . to start the connec@@ t@@ se , you need to select the appropriate menu item or select the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the entry of the folder you will inform a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the folder scanning , only those files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; if this scanning the folder , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder of the one found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded up . you can click on the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the icon or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub folders , and all sub folders with which you can download all the folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; click on a file double , the file will start immediately and it appears to be a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the gathering action will not be automatically selected . if the interaction is started , you will be informed of the problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , will be used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; according to identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered as identical if its entire content is identical . then , the folders also have the same color . with folders , age is essential for its color . &quot;
&quot; the colors about this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B cannot have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folders have been specified and if the option directories will be synchron@@ ize . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B do exist but are not identical : manage and save the result in both folders ( the user can see as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file just B ; directly after joining together &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two files are merged and the option Neu@@ er file is activated instead of linking ( uncertain ) , then examined &amp; col@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and proposes the newer file . if the files are different , but the exact date is identical .. As long as such errors are not fixed , the inter@@ connects of the folder may not be started . &quot;
&quot; while keeping a file after the other . it &apos;s status @-@ column shows fermentation when the interaction was successful , and corresponding to other messages if something was completed , you should make a final review and check whether the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in furn@@ ishing dialog the file comparative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for the solved conflicts will only be shown when three files are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either bring the only selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the gathering actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the interaction . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder inter@@ connec@@ ing mode C is used as the target , the two @-@ folder inter@@ connects B is chosen and / or B as the target used . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to complete all entries : select folder mer@@ ging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to run only the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if due to conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
select Sim@@ ons if you first want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then brings certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( bring together a single file ) then a pop @-@ up window will open ( note the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select once again folders / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , an appropriate dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will find a message and full status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so if you can decide to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before you proceed with the connec@@ tive entry . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually merged , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; those entries ( in the current session ) and guides them together at the later date of all entries . even if the interaction has been sur@@ passed or not saved , these entries will change once again . only if you change the together action , these entries are again merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) has now set a section called directory inter@@ connection with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . there are several patterns entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . the default is not to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders &quot; &quot; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders &quot; &quot; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files which would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ matic files will be ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this file is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files , one file is included . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether those files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; with links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic inter@@ sections are compared . when the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links are shown . &quot;
&quot; with links to folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared and recur@@ sively searched . a link to a folder of the one link will lead to itself and &amp; diff@@ usion ; ) This option is shortened in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file leads through and displays statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis , and considerably slower when it is applied to files that does not contain any text . ( type an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; compare a big folder over a long network , it may be easy to compare only the modification date and the file size . however , this velo@@ city will cost you a certain degree of safety . please use caution . &quot;
&quot; no real comparison is similar to the modification date . the files are considered as identical if they are identical in size . for example , it may be useful when copying the modification date has been lost . please note with caution . this option is inserted in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates Synchron@@ ize mode when two files are compared and no audi@@ folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals for joining together are selected so that the results are stored in either folders . this option is stored in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because the other file is not also modified . you should check this in any case . ) This option is stored in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the .@@ original file . if an old backup file is deleted with the .@@ ori@@ g expansion , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; usually the folder inter@@ connecting single files are visible ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want you , you can switch the option list &amp; text windows to switch main window in the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views . &quot;
probably you prefer to compare a file just using double @-@ click . nevertheless , in the directory menu will also have a corresponding menu item . you can also run a single file directly to the folder menu . as soon as you save the outcome , the status will be set up again and the file will not run once again if you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; KDE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a conden@@ sed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively stable . or .. , that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank lines &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used , there is a brief list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it may not be differenti@@ ated whether a link to a file or a folder reveals . then always a file is accepted as a link objective . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) . &quot;
there is no way to deal with per@@ missions or modification date . therefore the per@@ missions or modification date from the original starting . ( note the option of trust in size ) ( this is only possible with local files ) .
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as differences of viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always starts the built @-@ in differences in K@@ de@@ op . to launch K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , takes a patch file in the Unified format . then takes the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have been altered since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist &apos;s Com@@ pre@@ diction ) is already available . in addition the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can run together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs very long and have learned a lot by getting into the sources other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or get it like that .
you did not compile the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not be the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in default installed configure in / usr / local but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
&quot; if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are first treated as identical . if only a non @-@ white character is treated , the line is considered not identical . if lines according to each other , this is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will remember any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this is necessary to create a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C , and it is much effort to design extra a private file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for it has been too big so far . you can restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used to use another editor .
&quot; after removing the text is suddenly closed ; no sr@@ c has appeared , and the text does not clear . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to emphasize differences . even more high@@ lighting would be dis@@ ori@@ enting and missing the end . please use a different editor .
many good ideas and troubles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; KDE ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use C@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install 3 ; on a system with &amp; KDE ; compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE released the folder in your system , installed in the KDE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems while compile it . however , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; KDE ; ma@@ iling lists . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switching ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board or replacing the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the root folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to read about changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries indicated that have the differences . this also leads to that identical files in interaction cannot be copied to the target folder . if the target folder these files are not already mentioned , they are likely to be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched in the default version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
in default this option is down@@ lighted in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) as differences are treated in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual des@@ ktops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the surfaces , to stop their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ ktops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right button of the mouse button will be cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only displays the two entries for p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , appear also the icon and the name of the application and the entries minim@@ ized , maxim@@ ize , On desktop and finishing . &quot;
maxim@@ izing the application window on the full size of the desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears if you click on an application .
&quot; if this junction is marked , windows can be moved within the middle mouse button , with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other ktops . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the names of virtual des@@ ktops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; junction of this field lets the &amp; car@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual des@@ ktops . is it together with name display , the names are provided with Or@@ din@@ al@@ Pay , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; car@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable the selection . &quot;
&quot; here the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows a small view of the actual program window . remark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window is determined : classi@@ c@@ ingly leaves &amp; car@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , known as P@@ ager applications in some other Window@@ s.@@ W@@ agre@@ es shows all virtual des@@ ktops in a horizont@@ ally and sen@@ tically in a vertical line , which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; car@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage to view it in size , display the windows as symbols or with its content and move it . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; car@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent installation of switch @-@ up ... allows the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in dialog settings , but you can do it manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you do not have a spelling for the file , you need to log in as user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you need to assign the key to app@@ endi@@ x transparent fashion and assign this one value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; col@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of KDE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; it may be a screen saver . you can use &amp; b ; a part of the screen , as if you read in the newspaper read a Lup@@ e for the flush or the precise viewing of a photos . this documentation is intended for various users . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance loads .
&quot; start a window like top . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as the magni@@ fier window .. The picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is a larger area of the screen , and is listed below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cursor is like a mo@@ vable Lup@@ e . alternatively , you can indicate a selected display area in the screen window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse cursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) . &quot;
&quot; would you like to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that &amp; I don &apos;t yet be able to recognize the shape of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard KDE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the sel@@ ector mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse button in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button depressed so you can get the content of the magni@@ fier and move . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; in addition , if you press in addition the &amp; Shift ; taste button , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down remains fixed and only to move the lower right corner .
&quot; it has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board folder ( to add it later to other applications ) , the image are turning and much more . &quot;
starts or stop the update of the display . the upgrade of the update means that the required CPU time is about 0 .
&quot; select the Update rate ( Very low , low , means , high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; automatically your single command commands to save files , opening up a new window , printing , new@@ bie ( using the button document re @-@ load in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and cl@@ amps &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen pump . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of screen , so as if you use a Lup@@ o in order to use the clut@@ ch in a newspaper or a photo . this application is used for different people from the research into a newspaper or an artist to the web designer or seers . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place as soon as the mouse cursor a while on the same place is thought to help people suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive Stra@@ ine @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and those of each mouse click pains .
&quot; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place as soon as the mouse cursor is har@@ med for a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ ine In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . moreover , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; can deal with pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain that are related to the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even though &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain will help to prevent the mouse when clicking on the mouse is , it is against pain caused by blocking the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; if the mouse is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a break after it has em@@ ulates the mouse button . move the mouse even until the end of the movement , before the releasing of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can execute the pulling in pressing the mouse button . this way , you can get the pulling in pressed mouse button , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this denial must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; Intel@@ lig@@ ently reloc@@ ation is enabled , the time is set to push the mouse button ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set to push the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after closing the mouse button wa@@ its , if the mouse button does not wait again if the mouse is not done . &quot;
&quot; now the clicking through mouse @-@ shift ; now supports the clicking through mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . this function is activated , creates a long break after the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a long timer will be launched in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool _ str@@ kes@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten &amp; KDE ; to move the Re@@ action time ; go to the Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; start with each start of &amp; KDE ; this function is currently only under &amp; KDE ; please note the respective documentation at rate to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; put all settings on the values back , which were set at opening the dialogue . have you already pressed the button user , the settings will be reset at the booth after the last dump of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first with the preference . in particular , the smart t@@ anning you should first switched off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answer times of &amp; KDE ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places left a mouse @-@ click without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or points in the browser window that does not pose a link to un@@ noticed reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ ps , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse balls but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first you need to take the mouse out . as this happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . it should be clear however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt feet can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if you use the smart t@@ anning process , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation can no longer stop by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click . here the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
&quot; problem : when you enter the text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to place it . but , don &apos;t park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you are unable to create a ke@@ ystro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse cursor is &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the header lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with smart t@@ anning , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent hiding is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very likely to execute this way text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or to insert any other action if you prepare the mouse during pressing mouse button . here are some advice on it : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart t@@ anning process if you just start using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; select text instead of the text file , and keep the switching button , while you move the mouse into the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; this way , use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each mouse is pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent reloc@@ ation begins to use . however , you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use to be installed , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed ; it should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound@@ card and loud@@ speaker and this is correct .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ se@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is briefly tw@@ isted . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and are preparing the actu@@ ation of the buttons .
&quot; it can also be configured so that it is a particular time that it is waiting for a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , the pulling and desc@@ ended with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the mu@@ te user can speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of inter@@ viewing phrases that are once again spoken .
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen ) enter the command , which is later used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings . &quot;
on the second page you choose the standard text editor . from the text@@ books you can often choose text passages without having to tap into . the text passages can of course be processed .
&quot; on the third page ( right screen ) you define the dictionary for the Wor@@ th@@ ern@@ ation . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can set the list of words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly spell words can be recorded into the wor@@ dings . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a shift in the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth properly , you can enter the phrases that you want to hear . every spoken proposition is hang@@ ed in the course of the course . you can select from these propositions which are once again spoken . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; and this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ rains as well as the site K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the box , enter the command to call language generator . in the input field below the input field , you specify the text enco@@ ding , which will be shared with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; knows two kinds , add the text to the text . select the cross @-@ route , if the text is left unchanged as the default one to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross box is not selected , the text will be shared as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command will depend on your language generator . this command will be available in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use as a language service as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be available on this page , and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field actions according to the selection of a text passage , you determine which action by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text editor or in the box for text@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort the selected text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection panel , closing the service window for text pass@@ code , you can set out if the text editor &apos;s text message should be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text editor , the book is stored . if you select changes , the text editor will not be saved . if you want to ask any changes , the text editor will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the site Wor@@ ter@@ rains contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ th@@ ern@@ ation . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a sel@@ ector box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this sel@@ ector , you can currently use the dictionary for translation framework . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add the sequence of books or export them into a file . below the list , you can adjust the name and set the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads then the &amp; KDE documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by paragrap@@ hs of the occurrence . in addition you can submit the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks , what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these are to be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words automatically entered into the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main range of the window on the processing of text @-@ relevant books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text @-@ relevant books are presented as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text section or the keyboard short@@ cut , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add any actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages can change through pulling with the mouse to the new place , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , it is used to otherwise select the selected areas of the course . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if it is selected in the input field , it is used to otherwise select the selected areas of the course . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used to otherwise select the selected sets of the course . &quot;
&quot; this menu is inserted , a postpon@@ ed tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is set by default on the edit button . clicking on the sli@@ pped left side and pulling the tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu is crossed , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu is inserted , a postpon@@ able bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is arranged by default on the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . clicking on the sli@@ pped left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output not correctly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for the voice output on the box . ( see settings dialog for voice settings ) to further details . )
&quot; the Festival is a language @-@ edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch are currently supported . the license allows you to use festival for free and without any restrictions further . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is believed to be installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command version is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions on it . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the setup of the language output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS can be installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et . it is then available with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
for the third example the option has to be enabled as default data . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he turns a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into an Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to transform the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA will be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to use the last sign of the text so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more time @-@ consuming than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data will be enabled as default .
&quot; the voice output of &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems . &quot;
&quot; because the adjustment of language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; &quot;
&quot; to use the site K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a language generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; is an application , with the human being who can not speak text by the computer . there will be a list already spoken propositions which the user can always be re @-@ ordered . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth is not included . you have not yet to be installed on the computer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the address list of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; - the voice output system of &amp; KDE ; - is one of the modules of existing service , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; KDE ; it is a common application interface for &amp; KDE ; programmers are ready to be equipped with the applications with T@@ TS abilities . also users can offer it interesting possibilities .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; KDE ; applications are embedded . &quot;
&quot; the voice output is carried out via the program of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ pi@@ an , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows creation of language orders on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ aid program .
&quot; UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the guide service of &amp; KDE ; one application without visible windows , the T@@ TS @-@ services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offering . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of k@@ tt@@ s@@ d on k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the system phase .
a module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts from a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate , with which a text file can be read entirely or partially . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; KDE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / write info / KDE labels . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # KDE labels ) . &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , you need to install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the card map will be shown in the General Assembly . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ izer offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those who differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . it should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ . otherwise , as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used to the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printers in the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the card @-@ card speaker in C@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker will appear automatically . it will then be automatically set if you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and not set up a speaker . &quot;
all already appointed speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used in the language edition if there is no spokes@@ man for the language .
select a mouse click on the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
&quot; select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
select a mouse click on the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of the speaker in the list is also their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; frac@@ tal system .
&quot; choose a bal@@ lot here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young girl and girls agree to the selection . &quot;
&quot; click here , on the list of the new speaker on the card speaker . to change the settings of this spre@@ ader , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; for almost use . go back to the map of the General and check whether the T@@ TS &apos;s service will be activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; KDE ; start . now you can read and manage text . please click on the card orders to create and manage text . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language version of &amp; KDE ; launch on the card @-@ card General to open this card ticket . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; tick this junction boxes to enable the &amp; kt@@ . this start will start the card orders , and you can create text messages and read text messages and read the T@@ TS system by &amp; KDE . &quot;
&quot; if k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , that the field &apos;s voice will be activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this junction is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system section of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop and resume once again . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE file , read or open a text file . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card @-@ card in the General and cross there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text of the requested website . first , select the text you want to read , and select in the main menu tools text read text . after a short time the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; line @-@ lines and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; KDE ; you can read the text displayed . first , check the text you want to read , and select in the main menu tools text read text . then , the voice output will begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; k@@ ate , embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; KDE ; you will be noti@@ fied of the events indicated by you . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ .
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; KDE ; you can set up various kinds of messages . you can be noti@@ fied , if in a IR@@ C channel a message appears , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; KDE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , supports a menu of noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for the Noti@@ fy are different depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing chain composition offer a good option in &amp; t@@ ect@@ l ; it is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this can be accepted in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filtering is processed by text before being sent to the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unci@@ ation , in order to select wrong words or speakers , to choose a matching language and speaker , or to deal with certain defects in voice @-@ language and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program works &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; sets four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Sa@@ die has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the Screen reader is read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg . processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and norm@@ alized text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after issue of warning .
&quot; news is the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can start the space . &amp; KDE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text s@@ lugg@@ ish . each order , which you encounter from the card orders , is a text editor . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that is used by text s@@ lugg@@ ish@@ ly . text messages are intended for the issue of prolonged texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four commis@@ sions are lab@@ oured in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , during &amp; kt@@ ts , this issue is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen revisions . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; KDE ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are carried out as modules . in the future there may be even further types of filters .
sub@@ folders replace parts of a text by other text . the pos@@ ing parts can be given either as words or as regular expressions . set with pre @-@ defined drawing files such as : - ) by text or for the re@@ format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; contain some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with Spre@@ e@@ optional filters , you can order orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set up a female voice for example , you can read text of KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter does not apply that its rules do not exist , he remains the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text editor , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; send notification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it through all active filter , which were set up on the page below . editing data is carried out in order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of equipped normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are lab@@ elled the series from above down@@ wards . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will be shown below the following furnishings .
&quot; for the furn@@ ishing of strings , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern , then the text is exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . large and small case is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . this name you can choose any number , it just has to differ from the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replace it in accordance with the drawing chain from the column . &quot;
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store the current list or delete a list from a file , the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
here is a language registered but the filter is applied only when the speaker speaks for the text editor one of the languages described here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l mouse click on the button .
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; application ID is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers , you have to run out . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID @-@ ID @-@ 34@@ 32 can be shown , you may only be copied . &quot;
&quot; the dra@@ fting filter is applied only to the text if all the conditions apply with an entry in the box this filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string regul@@ ating filters are using regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating signs ( whit@@ esp@@ ace ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular phrases . but if you have access the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations &amp; # 160 ; expressions &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be installed on shap@@ ely XML . the aux@@ ili@@ ary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the spokes@@ man filter you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the box speaker , or an speaker with certain properties . you can for example specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; rec@@ t ; a text over@@ comes to the filter , it is a spokes@@ man for the text . the spokes@@ man is selected by the spokes@@ person for the speaker , which is the program selected by the spokes@@ person for the spokes@@ person . with the spokes@@ man filter you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; KDE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call this one click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to get a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you place the characteristics of the desired Spre@@ ader . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker will be selected to display the desired requirements most . &quot;
use these buttons to save or to delete or delete all settings .
the filter filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box this filters . you need to apply at least one condition .
&quot; the language edition API , by &amp; KDE ; with the programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS capacities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the language of C@@ TT@@ SD , so that this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; KDE ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is you can find on the KDE ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface of &amp; KDE ; from the program k@@ tt@@ s@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give .
&quot; open two &amp; con@@ sole ; window . start only k@@ tt@@ s@@ d on a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned languages supported my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Modi@@ fy filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you will also need to do so if you do not use this voice to read x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and find the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or intervention signs seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so all propositions can be ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the option string is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a string sensor filter . see &quot;

&quot; the language , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license that you can find in corresponding documentation or to the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
if you have access to the KDE sourc@@ ec@@ de@@ archive you can download the package using &amp; kt@@ ts ; find it in the directory k@@ tt@@ s@@ d . you will also find the source code of k@@ de@@ ded under ftp : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / KDE / .

&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , c@@ ze@@ ch , Polish , Russian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS works with any language of the language which can be started on the command line in a &amp; con@@ sole .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ . , according to information , which are not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module for language skills . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the Develop@@ er team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the SS@@ ML support and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; rec@@ t , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages , and the developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you purchase the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , which refer to the sourc@@ ec@@ ode from the source archive or to download each night up to date , translate and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language , you can use the shell @-@ script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ys ; that the program of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is used . the program c@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be developed in such a way that the installation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual phrases . the user can leave the pro@@ posi@@ tional or rep@@ lication , repeat , release or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application is text on &amp; rec@@ t ; it can indicate the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . thus , if you have set up an speaker , the language English and its sex is female , this one will automatically choose the best appropriate speaker . if you want to know more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts , you will see a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card speaker to add , and to edit a speaker in the list or click Edit , the card speaker is shown below . for example , the establishment of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules are shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text enco@@ ding for text , which is passed to festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is automatically performed . general is considered that Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or s@@ lov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust the volume , microphone speed and pitch level of the synthetic language . if you can not select some controllers and displayed this grey , the voice you will not choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multimedia voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this junction , these voices are already loaded in the launch of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( on greater memory consumption ) the first set is faster . &quot;
&quot; if this junction cannot be selected , you do not have set up any speaker ( or forget to click on application ) . &quot;
&quot; if this junction is marked , the launch of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system window . otherwise , after the start only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system stage , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system stage to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ section marks and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system field as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the opportunity to read and control otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here all orders have been performed in the queue , along with the application , which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight re@@ worked proposition . the spokes@@ man ID corresponds to the column ID on the box speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can be sat@@ ise in the order , which is selected in the list below , pre - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of settings are taken over and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system phase . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text applications will be performed and managed . expenses of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages are not shown . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; rec@@ t ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output will be used , select the audio output . if there are no output modules in the list , you have to install Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
&quot; set the turn@@ out speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 00 ; % about double normal speed speed . so that these settings may be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take on the new settings for the running &amp; frac@@ tal system .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device is working with you . in doubt you choose default .
&quot; on this card , you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Sa@@ die has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is being reserved too hot . a warning is holding the output of messages and norm@@ alized text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the warning of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you have a long text on a website , you can greet with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome the space . &quot;
&quot; if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text editor will be interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on these cards are valid only for normal text applications . for news , warnings and spending of Screen revisions , there are no special promotions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages posted , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click messages . &quot;
&quot; tick this junction to switch the reading of &amp; KDE ; disadvantage devices . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and f@@ kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;

&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice version . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , speech speed , volume , voice and sound level . also brands for the control of pron@@ unci@@ ations for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default voice that the festival is used in the SS@@ ML issue .
&quot; if the settings for speed or tape in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100 free ; % is adjusted , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start reading text into individual phrases . thus , the first sentence has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text editor . thus , you can also stop or stop on the cardboard card orders for sales or res@@ tra@@ int and break , even if the language of the language is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , the first start of a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , beginners is discour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; at the simplest you will learn the setup of the spre@@ ader by sample . turn off the option selection and check out text selection again , change some features and check out how the choice of the spre@@ ader changes . to do so , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; if only the first proposition can start , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you may also hold any text orders on the card orders or retri@@ eved , even if the language of the language is not supported . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter is automatically set up when you launch k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off just removed . do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
recognis@@ ing filters compare text with a regular expression for Stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ulation mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) in the statutes ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) in front of the filter automatically from the text ) . note that the standard @-@ pro@@ posi@@ tional filter is attached to the string .
&quot; BD filters are never applied to &amp; KDE ; messages , al@@ erts , messages or the output of Screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ sions the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter , you can insert it again by load the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
on the card sel@@ ector you can write the socket @-@ settings for the application . the card @-@ card is displayed when
use of the default speaker ( the top on the box speaker ) . in other words : there are no speakers .
&quot; use of the most suitable spokes@@ person , which has all the properties of a furnished spre@@ ader . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the spokes@@ man , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the spokes@@ person who originally specified the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired Spre@@ ader properties by clicking on one of the sel@@ ector buttons .
&quot; here you select the properties of the desired Spre@@ ader . if this feature does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; select this junction , if the property should have priority before other features . you can also put several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when printing is the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will always want to specify this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application text is sent to a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the characteristics in the field of speaker , which is the most likely to delete , click the &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; button to use the default button and then apply to speaker that is the most likely to be listed below . &quot;
in this case 0 is 0 for the last text editor in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number is input 0 necessary ) .
&quot; tt@@ sm@@ gr free@@ zes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get feedback . &quot;
&quot; g@@ ou@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably , you have to register . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , the command G@@ ST register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not resolved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install g@@ ou@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output on Al@@ sa is not working if I play music at the same time with another application . if I hold a text editor , fri@@ ghtened &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem exists that conflicts can occur in al@@ sa that can prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project equi@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival but tt@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add a new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / k@@ tt@@ s@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / record the new voice . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; to which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and can be conspic@@ uous by the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ us such as Festival Interactive offer yourself on the map of tickets for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or inactive . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read it . ( this is because the HTML is controlled in SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ per@@ former@@ filter , and set up the turn@@ out speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel that websites can be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the Web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able gender does not seem to work . thus , there is no error produced , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the change of SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a string , set @-@ up filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ . no more sat@@ ise orders will be displayed , the order there is only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; point Bad@@ ge ( point , question mark , pro@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use a filter by typ@@ ing a filter instead . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with al@@ sa conflicts in the audio output . if your system is also counted , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text , and then start a further start . possible solutions to this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with state of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you have a text contract in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current proposition will be read yet . &quot;

&quot; the following modules for language skills are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ dependent of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Debian distribution ) . the column option to switch off the argument shows the configure parameter , which causes the transfer of the yield . &quot;
&quot; installed as default ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you have to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = finish . for example &quot;

&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first use , check if your language is working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ synthes@@ izer , whose sources is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided by festival . if you want to read Web sites you need to install the ( male UK ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
&quot; this voice is made up of 1,@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stages . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / Frequ@@ ent / rus@@ sian / . if you enter Russian voices , you must select a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; therefore you look for the first time on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer will be used with the L@@ MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this gives the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete speech system is generated . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . you can find more information .
&quot; in this process , additional Wr@@ apper Code is added to the festival by using &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices are not installed in the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ stimulation files are not installed in the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Fol@@ der , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under : &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , allowing the administration of network interfaces , the route and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings over a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called .. &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ book ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
after installation a new module network settings is displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started via selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; menu menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must already be fully installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the unit at all points and allows setting the network features .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added while installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files according to the kernel version . &quot;
&quot; the module network settings is loaded , when the option settings will be selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this module is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the main choice is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list , which the distribution and the rel@@ eas@@ ers stand at the best . by moving the setting out @-@ again , the setting can be permanently hit . at the next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; change the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are grey , which means the settings can only be considered , the modification is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter the button at the lower end of the module . it is the entry of the password required . &quot;
in the system of system mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
&quot; the rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed , from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out : &quot;
the settings of the shown network interfaces can be set up by selecting the requested device in the list and click of the button to set up ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ HC@@ P server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be required for the system at the same time . in the selective list , no further adjustment is required . in the selective list can be selected either D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , it is possible to set the TCP / IP address without D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the TCP / IP address must be set . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface on bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the needs . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the needs . &quot;
sets the IP @-@ address of the host in the local sub@@ net which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for the TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
&quot; if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the grid in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support re@@ places a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNA trig@@ gers this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution is a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a single and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with kno@@ bs up or possessions . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button of the button ... from the group machine to the nam@@ ing solution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the dialog &apos;s new name server . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then click on the button . the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group machine to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the &quot; &quot; Edit button &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
&quot; the list dedicated to known machines describes the machine @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats , when there is no DNS server available . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains specifically known computers some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this is still in the test of IP to replace 4 in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... The dialog of New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add @-@ Add button . if the familiar computer has multiple Ali@@ as names , de button Add multiple times and enter the other ali@@ ases name . &quot;
select an entry of a specifically known host list from the list and select Edit .... The dialog acquaint@@ ance will be processed .
&quot; it may be one of the following tasks to be executed , then with click OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , needs to be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command will be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) it is sufficient as &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t installed .
installing the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case the installation of Q@@ t and KDE is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; these commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second one all will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
this area can not replace more detailed knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( do @-@ it ) network is conve@@ yed .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been able to spread it . from IP@@ v@@ 6 it is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focusing on widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is available . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the contact point , which can be used as a valid IP address , if available , D@@ HC@@ P can not simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose to avoid IP address conduc@@ ts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not re@@ passed on the Internet , therefore their any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses are used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the range is large enough for networks to 250 machines . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs after a tim@@ etable in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list already existing tasks and per@@ taining ambient variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will be available for all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded . &quot;
&quot; with a de@@ activated task program , program name and parameters is not displayed and below the description appears down@@ lighted . &quot;
the variable ambient variables are the otherwise existing ambient variables for all of the tasks . in a de@@ activated variable it appears as a description .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . go then in the menu to edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the folder folder and select the text menu in New ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to start@@ ling program . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path@@ name . if you want to look for the program first , press out .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; if you choose both mon@@ th@@ day ( e ) and week@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the program will run both during the 1st and 15th and 15 months , the program will run independent from the week@@ day , and on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as in creating new tasks , changes will only be active when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , they first select the task to remove . go then to edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , they first select the task to copy . go then to edit copying . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select copying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to add a task , first one has to cut off or copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then it is available at all . select the tasks folder . go then to edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right button of the mouse button on the folder folder and insert , or select C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , first select an off . go to the menu item Edit ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and change ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog task in which you , as described above , can edit the chosen task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task . go to the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select it , and determine the state with the menu item Edit activation . inactive tasks are lab@@ eled in their description with inactive . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the task and select the right mouse button on the task and activate . make sure that program name , parameters and description can be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to run a task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new ambient variable , select first the variables folder . go to the menu item Edit New .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variables folder and select New ... or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variables . you can also choose one from the list of the most commonly used ambient variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable name .
to send e @-@ mails from the back program to another than the normal address
&quot; as in creating new variables , changes will only be made when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;

&quot; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the variable and select En@@ ts . make sure that name and value of the variable will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and ambient variables were entered or altered , you still have to save the cr@@ on@@ tab . select the menu item file . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; push changes or supplements to tasks or variables will only be active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard KDE ; -@@ print dialog . in case you choose , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended permission .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the cr@@ on@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX @-@ con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to find time and date . &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for band drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first was to answer a surface for tar that put my wife : how much longer does it take when you are looking for ?
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be included from &amp; k@@ date ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; scale the band back and read the pre@@ tension of the belt . re@@ alis@@ es &amp; k@@ date , the pre @-@ spell on the tape does not know if the tape should be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ date ; the pre @-@ spell , searches for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol changes for the belt drive to indicate that the band has been involved . in the status bar the file appears . the content of the volume can now be searched for the tape by closing the agreement . &quot;
&quot; before leaving the volume , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change to the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ date ; can be used it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ date ;
&quot; a band@@ species must be form@@ at@@ ted before you have to be used for storing data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ date ; this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting when you have to form@@ at@@ ted . flo@@ ppy band drives usually put a form@@ atting of the volume that DA@@ T drives on the other hand . &quot;
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ date ; with the form@@ atting of the ban@@ ker . all data on the tape will be lost ! after the end of the form@@ atting process the tape is automatically integrated and ready .
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files that can take place on three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only stored in this file or directory .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files stated in the profile are only secured .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; right click on the local file tree , and select in the menu &quot;
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or directory is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item .
&quot; once the exam has been started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for veri@@ fying , the dialog will appear over . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as data use and the remain@@ der time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the re @-@ establish , the files you want to be restored . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the band@@ pass . it will be restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose to restore in the menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been launched , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data base , and the remain@@ der time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band inde@@ xed file using the band &apos;s content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
&quot; hereby , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings are created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current work folder in which the backup is to be performed . the list of files to be lower@@ ed files will be automatically updated .
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , is that only those files are stored on the same file system as the Fol@@ der . each entry is viewed separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to establish changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shots from the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device driver for the band@@ pass ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ model variant of the band@@ leader .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ date ; before the tape is integrated , the command will load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , tried &amp; k@@ date ; to block the design at the band@@ pass . possibly , this setting is not working with all band drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the loos@@ ening of the integration of &amp; k@@ date ; automatically the band is ej@@ ected . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , tried &amp; k@@ date ; to change the hardware file size for the band@@ pass . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ date ; in any case , the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ date , a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the volume . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is set together as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The volume ID . the format of this sequence is calcul@@ ating : seconds , with the name of the complete name of the system , on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the epoch . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ date .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental backup .
check the content of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where to get information on your system or where the system uses the different protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users the quick access for instance on information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files are fil@@ tered and analysed . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful functions . include :
&quot; support for many different types of protocols , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server , and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the following chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the screenshot you see &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol @-@ lines can be easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start is tried &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol will open , and it will not be displayed on its a small news window , so you will not have the log file under Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for the normal user does not usually have a justification for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filtering bar to filter after a selected crit@@ erion or inserted into the filter line . the list of the log line is now automatically changed , so that only a log line will appear next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry at this point . select the character string of the filter protocol , and enter the name of a process in accordance with the settings of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors will be displayed with a striking color as protocol @-@ lines of level note . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be turned off .
&quot; if you want to display only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or at the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can select the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new protocol @-@ lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows to display and manage multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the window . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum software software log@@ .@@ forum software . there you will find additional information about the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; KDE ; Subversion archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; KDE ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; hence , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here further to historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone might attempt to put a machine on System V In@@ it , without a new installation and re@@ format . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service you want to boot the system or when changing to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ tes that only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be placed under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to perform something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a bit inter@@ connected , then you come to fix it and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one includes K , the script will be called stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people would like to set up a simple way of setup machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , which lets just htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , in addition , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand device is simple to not say trivial : simply drag an entry out of the area of the Av@@ ail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ way to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also shift from the run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere . thereby , the entry is removed from its original une level ( or its position ) . this only does not happen if they withdraw an entry from the area of the Av@@ ail@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you want to drag them into a new area . to simply select it from the menu to edit or from the context menu , and even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a contract may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries into the trash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the different working areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ way with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually modify the sorting number or the name of a contract , press the input button to open the properties tab . use the tray button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preference will be taken to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local c@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have been experimenting with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts continuously . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the L@@ IL@@ O -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in an individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I &apos;ve provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for version under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , then you will need to edit any additional files in / etc . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , how system services should be launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check whether all the configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) simply quit without message when your configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ way , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have done changes , you need to save it . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards cards ; the user and the user list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears on the dialog user or group properties .
&quot; some card cards are shown only when you have advanced system settings . first , if you have activated space card ( Qu@@ ota ) for users you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; card password can be installed , if shadow @-@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; card map will only be activated if for at least a built @-@ in file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can use any user parameters in each user : &quot;
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using plac@@ ements with the help of the field file system .
&quot; card group provides information about the group belonging to the chosen user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , users can choose to be member in other groups by mark them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog features of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the &quot; &quot; Add -@@ button of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ IL@@ O boot@@ manager , remove the boat password , remove and modify the time up to the bo@@ oting of the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , modify operating systems , change , change and more . &quot;
