<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in unzipped shape or in a container with a lossless compressional salt (deflate). there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licence-free and open shell format designed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on TIFF / EP Format and is required to use metadata for the needs and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nikon at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology, a mixture of XML and RDF.

<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and allocation of color film. colour mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the helmets.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to be found in the menu under colours. this tool provides an integrated way to save several color channels at the same time and allows you to use it for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same correction. in the manual for the correct correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors of gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & checking came; tool Farming effects presents four color effects, a solar system, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a filter filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical workmanship, solar system, also called Sabatier, an effect of which was completed if one completed a partial print of a short flash, and after that the development of the picture was completed. the result was a partial explanation of the image. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to edit this interesting effect delicate."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. an additional increase finally generates a negative image that so does not produce on photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiety that makes it a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy it embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimised color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and with it a reference for his smooth picture structure. Velvias strongly saturated color are also some photographers, especially those which hardly discard them. "</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the slider reps the strength of the neonlichtes. in large images the filter can blast the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos correct. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo with bad lightness you can get the reverse problem: one too big satiety. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation reduce a good choice for saturation instead of increasing them. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool has a valuable correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you will need only the area of the slider. concrete the three sliders below the histoprogram."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitization; provides three different tools to the edge of the field. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpened is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, grained images."</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually sharpens it is rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove the atmospheric Dunst and it's here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted from Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"focusing is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more retroactive sharpening as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG image, a camera is often used internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format must always be sharpened while processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners turn a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable it, you get control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations you can get usable results by calling a photo with the archipelago's sharpness, which allows you to shoot with the menu."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should deal with caution though the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also boosting the noise. in general, the most usable technique for sharpening an image is increasing the tool. under Refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution, the picture is a little soft to draw. use the tool for softened with the menu of corridor and experiment with some settings. the window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help you process the image. the forerunner shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried out. an increase in radius or the amount will strengthen the effect. if you make the insharpness mask too strong, sound and impression of grats near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius arises a how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radio stations. you should therefore produce images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image one that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference differential. one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a cante of filters. in this way areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharpened and therefore beauty faults in faces, Heavens and water-surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitiled; tool refocus is focused on a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used to use the copyright-protected unfolding filter by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo a picture & quot; refocuserenquot; in which it is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. refocus usually reaches better results than unsharp. you can start it out of the menu by calling colours refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular folding work much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, depending on this, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. that causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. you can set up a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but then in Heiligenscha. "</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values can be higher than 0.1 only rarely. however, the filter is higher than 0.1. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will continue to waste a high value."</seg>
<seg id="502">"paleness's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use these parameters if your insharpness Gauß is caused. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0, to avoid annoying artefacts. in most cases, you should use this value to zero so that you might need to increase the correlation and / or the smoke filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"mattress size: this value determines the size of the transformation unit. an increase in the matrix size can generate good results, especially when you choose great value for the circular sharpenness or the Gauß's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you choose great value for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the stores as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"attempt to carry out all tricuts, dyes, and integration types on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not immediately visible, but they later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you are reading pictures and compress, as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masking produces better results as sharpness. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically I have to see unsharp masking always to remove artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be seen the effect of insharpen. for the Vienna filter you can show that it's the optimal linear filter. convenient is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture has to be corrected. this picture has been made using an analog camera. the unfocussed result is attributed to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods of sharpenance correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The shelf smoothness is made the blurring of the area that was darkened to create a more natural pendulum.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the inks will enable a customized color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The instrument imaging is one of the most developed tool to not remove desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inan algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starters in order to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to set the filtering settings of a jusade, you can use the tab for smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed restraint p [0] 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness on the picture. weighted values mainly homogeneous regions smooth and detail. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening must be subordinated and subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Straightening alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granular or CCD Rauches will create a high value of wavy patterns. JPEG artifacts will best be removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor over allel. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smooth, as it is difficult to value the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effects it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: there is how often the algorithm are going to go through. usually here 1 or 2 out of the algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-length da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen, there should also be small chosen. make sure that small corner produce a long term for you. you should choose this value as best possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral units [0,1, 10]: integrale stepwidth in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glasses and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low. he doubles but the term. we recommend it to let him go.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save As and store make exactly this. any setting of image error corrected can be saved into a text file and later recharged again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image error corrected is relatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, the calculation can cancel at any time using the button crash."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image error with little artefacts removed. the module is applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact that has been caused by a bad starting footage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitization has been a very powerful tool to reduce capturing. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool presents selectable image filters available to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor rusting from the camera or Moiority; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor consuming digital cameras, so you can read it in English on this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high standard of sensitivity. it shows a granny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindow details and the advanced settings may remain at default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can cleanse the image over the picture and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness of the filter. this value will determine the filter forward. if it is increased, noise tips will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter images can no longer receive and ruffing or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response to the filter. if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise or noise tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak sound or JPEG artifacts without losing detail.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminosity of the image. we recommend either color or lighthouses to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color balance of the image. we recommend you to change color or lighthouses to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which is typically more distressed to increase. however, it also trays the attendees areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjusting of the Phasenjitterabsorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius. when it is increased, the edges may appear smooth, if it is too high, can remove noise and phasenjitter to edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store under and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how drug reductions can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crackable for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to switch with the menu item and experiment with the smoothness on the right side of the dialog. the preview of this operation shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitization; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photoartefacts.</seg>

<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-Sampling is adaptive; recursively, because every pixel is further divided again and adaptive because the recurrensioning depends on the calculated colour values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"when you select the first method, POV-Ray worked out a beam of pixels. if the difference between colour values is reduced, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth of 4x4 additional points, a repository of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. when the difference between colour values exceeds the pre-given threshold, then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be checked individually and be checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the repository."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should typically offer for most people and most music pieces, acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -B 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rates about 5.5. needs more and 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a Title. good pleasure for music of young people, portable devices and Autostereoinstallations. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without paying attention to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, which is manually entered, or managed by the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used to create folders and file names as well as the features of the music files."</seg>

<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (mention of the UFO) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted. all information can be received by the artist or CD; business, physically or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator, you can actively select a cross-mail address (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address will not be used to retrieve the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>

<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how notes on a particular channel or instrument are illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the pATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboard for each channel and each instrument. you just have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the percussion channel. see for example the supplied keymaps.</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so this can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anyone, & cmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control of everything."</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let us replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; do not choose from the menu-menu;, graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"and kiconedit; uses standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size."</seg>

<seg id="2052">"I would like to choose the separator (very left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, which should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="2056">"if NeueXML does not exist, it will be used as root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder (s), so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the corresponding type."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like most. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -repository check if someone has done this for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to let the docrc file. the first part we leave you to the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations, e.g., Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = €1.html tag2 = convention 2.html tag2 = convention 3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example you can see it now in the & PHP; documentation is such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config file [Tree] Doc t = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2, # Getting Started = Introduction = Curx.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # in front of Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border to the shaft alignment (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and more consistent at the top end of the tree-view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space affect nothing but pay attention to & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the section is the area of the docrc file, which is intended for designing a context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script indicate the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file mandatory line."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of by Beistrich separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"now you can save your docrc file just a $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc / apps / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDED</seg>
<seg id="2069">"when you are sure that this is good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation have been used on the & quantaplus; -repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"you are not alone. it is possible to share the discrete resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places, there will be an email address given by email, toolbars toolbar, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; -users will be checked and only made available when our team needs them as correct and useless for publishing, we recommend the resources of resources, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"in the uploading you will be asked after their passphrase for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you may need multiple keys you may need to stay. in a dialog new resource you need to stay filled in the dialog box (URL Preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the uploading will be started."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can upload and upload the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, still before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the intoxicity of the resource is warning, and it can then be cancelled. please check the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message will appear with the specification of the resource of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages that is currently not created by & quantaplus; but creation may be time consuming because hundreds of day files can be necessary in the day XML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by the DTD load and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and make full benefit of & quantaplus; therefore, this chapter is to give them close to these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who is & quantaplus; saved, available. by toolbars about actions, everything is marked as global, in common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved, this enables the group of administrators different toolbars, promotions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available to anyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web applications for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be all of & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are embodied in the folder tree of the project, indicating the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project. "</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the builders, the carton board with information and the toolbars. please enter in, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click with the right button of the mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, recharge, delete, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or version of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, such as & lt; then click the icon that includes the tag, then you can insert the data for this just inserted day (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>

<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what connection they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates are available only in the project and templates."</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where to get information on your system or where the system uses the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users the quick access for instance on information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, attempts to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files are filtered and analysed."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of protocols, for the format of the syslog server, and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the following chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the screenshot you see & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the individual protocol-lines can be easily filtered and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start is tried & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol will open, and it will not be displayed on its a small news window, so you will not have the log file under Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for the normal user does not usually have a justification for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filtering bar to filter after a selected criterion or inserted into the filter line. the list of the log line is now automatically changed, so that only a log line will appear next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry at this point. select the character string of the filter protocol, and enter the name of a process in accordance with the settings of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level errors will be displayed with a striking color as protocol-lines of level note. the colored representation of protocol-lines can be turned off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or at the cron protocol), so you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, you use Filterbar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to display all new protocol-lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows to display and manage multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the window. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum software software log.forum software. there you will find additional information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & KDE; Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & KDE; system V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program start-up of the system in the & Linux; hence, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further to historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone might attempt to put a machine on System V Init, without a new installation and reformat. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service you want to boot the system or when changing to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as settes that only once started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be placed under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to perform something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a bit interconnected, then you come to fix it and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one includes K, the script will be called stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people would like to set up a simple way of setup machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server Runlevel, which lets just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., in addition, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry out of the area of the Available system services to one of the six runway to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also shift from the runleveln or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere. thereby, the entry is removed from its original une level (or its position). this only does not happen if they withdraw an entry from the area of the Available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you want to drag them into a new area. to simply select it from the menu to edit or from the context menu, and even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a contract may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to enable the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runway with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually modify the sorting number or the name of a contract, press the input button to open the properties tab. use the tray button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preference will be taken to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; restored changes to the presets are stored in a local csysvrc.</seg>

<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution, please check whether all the configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply quit without message when your configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
