&quot; although I had visited the US for at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I also grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this country had a profound profound effect on me , that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura student co@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil mag@@ nate who were fo@@ ster@@ ing his interest to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was tr@@ apped .
&quot; freely to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was like that the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love story about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written on the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bot@@ her@@ nia .
he never keeps behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he tells exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague express it , and openly explains his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and women . &quot;
nevertheless people have re@@ acted to his statements and voted in flocks for him .
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won with the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party nom@@ inations . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ ot@@ hel@@ per person asked me ?
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his elec@@ torate with people who I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of journalism , the people from around the world record , a deeply unbeliev@@ ing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Wel@@ view was not agreed with that of Peter B@@ h@@ atia , the present publisher of &quot; &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
B@@ h@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s In@@ tolerant anz is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits her with the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my mentor , whose wise advice helped me much with my career . &quot;
these people and those through them are rooted in my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp did his way to the nom@@ inees presidential elections , they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , in spite of - or perhaps precisely because of its contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; dealing with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , leaving me nearly the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superf@@ icial and respectful , and suggests a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most white are tuned for Tru@@ mp , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from contemp@@ t on those who look different . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( m . ) . : so much as the dis@@ ser@@ tation of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , as much as Sch@@ leu@@ kins , as it did the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have always , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country has chosen as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ y@@ ans , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , there is a huge part of the white America of that promise , saying : hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back in the ru@@ d@@ der , say it . &quot;
&quot; with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a sound@@ ly &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ ushed the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ ino have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they said .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and sil@@ ken &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan completed with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tru@@ mp , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , &quot; said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

from the aff@@ liction to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love for music by trash

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music that is played on both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
&quot; music , which lives with the waste &quot;
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an ancient colonial city which is popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one from children and adults existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a school @-@ school with 100 students is the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the ban@@ den violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and the youth offered so rare hop@@ eless@@ ness . &quot;
the young band@@ members take their commitments towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI . &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and play with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn the day for trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero - a village situated at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments that are made of recycled material : &quot;
&quot; music with recur@@ rent instruments made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling led by F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to turn parts of the fall into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , vi@@ ola , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion that were all made from the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez reminds a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning period : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as a F@@ avi@@ o something , which he had never seen before : a made of waste @-@ made violin . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from recycled material and called The recycled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical power on :
the world generates around one billion tons of trash .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational acting from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before the Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication is done by an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been driven by illegal fishing in illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were accordingly up@@ lifted and little til@@ ted , to welcome a law of these kinds at their co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by lands that you simply did everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at once and followed . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch them there .
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pill@@ age of the fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that were driven out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , hidden in what it is extremely difficult to trace . so , the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can cause a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucratic obstacles and also through the snow@@ fl@@ ab@@ ou@@ o , with the information in different countries , the actions now occur in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists of existing licenses , news on ev@@ apor@@ ating activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a long@@ shore spec@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that fish in bot@@ t@@ ted areas - such as those who indicate that a ship invites its captured fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a c@@ anned roy@@ alty , where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ al bl@@ ister . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , may then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships can not sell their charge , and that they could even be forced to numbers pen@@ alties , such as in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it then goes to considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing catch is not worth more . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain by estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade in East African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fis@@ sur@@ geries that attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include actions like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of fanta@@ sies , the fish protected species and the fishing in protected areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could be illegal and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ling my harbor . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal lo@@ oph@@ ole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
so far the closed front operates .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; it has uncovered criminal networks , which had spread counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found it volati@@ le ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which has always been developed , will also help to trace the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , can switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be termin@@ ated by satellite . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information on each other . it is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the sea protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed through the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of what is doing - it simply gives sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminals , but also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships that were formerly without a license and barely expected to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fisheries sales , since then fishing boats have more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i , Somalia had helped to play Gre@@ ko 1 on board , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With Security is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures to arise in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state could report its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were not allowed to be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also im@@ bu@@ ed in bot@@ ene waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures to Gre@@ ko 1 put it a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such special , collaborative effort is functioning on the oceans of the oceans .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians who ran into their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country by being assembled in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ c ( e.g. : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the Flach@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the centrally located district of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ located Bund@@ est@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously in the daily life of the Venezuel@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition looked at the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the res@@ tra@@ int of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the context of the resolution : &quot;

&quot; there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to his own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral back safe , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country attempted to hold some protesters , the police forces , including those women in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts , because anything else could see what many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an in@@ fo@@ graphic set up the round , which forms the extent of oppression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has oppressed the land .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a minister@@ ial process - it was now proven in the eyes of many through the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs :

&quot; others have taken these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which had done little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather have to dis@@ solve the critical voices . &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches take more and more in frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adap@@ ted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , he said Qui@@ x@@ ano now in the framework of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba to his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen to be chosen .
&quot; starting at the office , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military formations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he held the family @-@ secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a c@@ lich@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ or &apos;s officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was from 1976 to 1978 Deputy commander of the Secret Services section of La Per@@ la . &quot;

archiving .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor that is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ anos Son , a man who had seen the extent of atro@@ cities over the years , which he had seen as a boy , and who spoke against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power has a parent on his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; as my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there , I went with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a dick@@ head , you have sent you with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; simply pass that she will not take you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &apos; party Argentina .
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be obe@@ dient . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had educated me .
&quot; on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers , which had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Pro@@ pag@@ and@@ am@@ material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he left me at the entrance of the car . &quot;
&quot; as he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything about it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little wrapped in a blan@@ ket , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump silver . &quot;
this day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were picked up and held me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I j@@ umped in and saw a couch , on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
&quot; later , I found out that they fixed the end of a cable . the other end was fortified on the body of the person who was there being captiv@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; it rarely takes a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ poured it with water and chan@@ ted it a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there in it was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that this is the smell of a body in need .
I never could forget that smell .
&quot; and I asked myself , How is it possible for a man to do so much suffering ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to the work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - to the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and counter@@ parts . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were laid down with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated at the hands and feet .
near the entrance of cau@@ tious people still on matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw among the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; Why have you gu@@ essed so , dick@@ head ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I decided &quot; Why did you put me down ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man collap@@ sed and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the Civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged with the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio S@@ sia leads to the head of La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ k@@ eg@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the path , where you came in , is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ ers came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of up was that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the advent of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to home .
at that time at the age of age I had no idea what the &apos; war mare &apos; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later in the military - I was at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war mare a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs , which one takes an enemy to combat one enemy . &quot;

&quot; but when one goes to a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also officer of the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penetr@@ ate into a house , and to steal it all in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminals and I replied : and you who stal@@ ks cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and surround you . &quot;
that &apos;s why we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I realized in the process , I showed a photo of that at that time I had a jacket and a wheel@@ ed swe@@ aters from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still carried clothes back home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators had been to be with this crime . I have no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to break out . &quot;
&apos;@@ the cas@@ ing of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act .
&quot; now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one sees the value of a life . &quot;
one is developing and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
&quot; well , you have to say to the dictatorship over the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children dec@@ eive ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured but why were they killed ?
one could simply have been able to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to whom you could pass their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced once more , they got machines to eliminate the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were wounded and we@@ eping somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something of course remains always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals -- including my father .
&quot; the thought , show my Father , arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt war@@ dly dead and asked me , why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; that they were supposedly defen@@ cel@@ ed , actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you say anything to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed horri@@ fic crimes , and you have forced me to join me as a child . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ utes only &quot; &quot; Even then I am sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
2010 I saw the first ad .
&quot; finally , I knew that he was a criminal . &quot;
nobody can tell me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally have said to my own Father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still standing before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , un@@ lawful liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death succession in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the span@@ ish of the magnitude of the document .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera appeared in the past between March 1975 and December 1978 as a crime against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
43 oppres@@ sors was found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court filed in 28 cases life @-@ long adhesi@@ on and in nine cases of adhesi@@ on between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were release .
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ endants died during the process .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ ity : murder , torture and rape by ministers . &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military members , former police and civilian employees . &quot;
Piero De Monti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant female in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the Silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a deadly factory conceived of in@@ humane heads .
J@@ uris@@ diction is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on fairness for victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the At@@ tor@@ ney of the 1995 @-@ founded Argent@@ inian Organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of man who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took for 39 years . &quot;
in March 2007 the Argent@@ ine@@ an Government gave the country on which La Per@@ la stood there to be a memorial that is now headed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , in which one can pro@@ long his leadership . &quot;
the photo was distributed in the social media .
processing of the original photo of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his leadership , last month a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on one shield the Japanese word &quot; &quot; Zar@@ ago@@ za &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; mistak@@ enly - perhaps - perhaps also with a lot of h@@ ind &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible car @-@ driver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September at electronic display in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os , and he was also aware of the loc@@ al@@ time attention . &quot;
the daily post Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n has written :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation is initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; Social @-@ driver &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ matic is not a correct term &quot; &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the pre@@ fecture were used for the translation errors . furthermore it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked on its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; I sincerely felt that older people felt by insufficient correction ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News used to deal with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an adequate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police there are the percentage of older drivers who are nation@@ wide involved in accidents , but definitely cause concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , recorded Sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; by this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; as the number of accidents in total declined , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the specifically re@@ porter released in the article published on Yahoo published version of article comments to light , which show the prejudices several Japanese seemingly against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received among other things the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; awesome motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; so error is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that this is a true translation failure .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in all of Asia is so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true mine for this bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to transfer an active language skills to transfer it into the language language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native language , in general , the belief that trans@@ lators should be in the language of the language - not in the language language - native language . &quot;
thus it should translate one French speakers for example from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the survival , cost @-@ reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign employees , can still use translations of company @-@ internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose Engl@@ ish@@ ly become the best ones , to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and mysterious sentences arise through machine @-@ related translations , show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling re@@ prints , often used t @-@ shirts or pockets , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable to as jewelry or at least harmless . but of large companies or the government that have the funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto is hopefully a reputable source of its translations into the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ oring measures on the Internet and TV
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ er@@ con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an internet users used to have no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet sites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV will not be accessible as well . &quot;
&quot; other on @-@ line transm@@ it@@ ters also over@@ took photos of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ position@@ ists who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ solved the Parliament and transferred the responsibilities of the Parliament to the executive , and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was made , and recommended the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers are once more locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 in reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission was approved for telecommunic@@ ation and lock@@ ers if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable @-@ TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT filters confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly passes its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous research study by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . it is a technique that does not respond to the DNS server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ sive or denied the request for a call to such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ For@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who took over the protests in Car@@ acas , taken into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was struck while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the Government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this will keep the Venezuel@@ an access to multiple media coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to obtain a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga had a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina stands for the rights of children and collects witness to other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who were just like they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que , &quot; es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; cows , dro@@ pping Schools &apos; ) , which is edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before she studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something has become , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga had never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , it is more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to do countless days of house@@ work which can never be paid and will be victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot raise . &quot;
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos; practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite multiple complaints from human rights organizations .
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered reports , researched and den@@ oun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things about the name , because the feeling of thank@@ fulness that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ ans , is guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double deception , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that their daughter is in the faith that they complete their education to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; something from themselves &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family stands with the girl in itself and whose exploitation is justi@@ fies with faith that they would give someone a chance that else would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ve them . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mist@@ re@@ ated , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came into hospital , her body showed traces of fierce slaughter . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ ca@@ ran@@ gement Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a supervis@@ or at the residence . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira lived with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
several days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they designated the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and called there &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the Ehe@@ pa@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a fast study of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case is coming to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trac@@ tive - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the farms in which their father worked , bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers had now to go all work and started to sell on the street , or on the market candy to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; she had to share the time so much , that she also remained a time to learn . &quot;
it was up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , they pur@@ se the fridge , pl@@ ushes the living room , polished furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the more it was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says that she never had to go to star@@ ve , but I also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some end of the bud@@ ge@@ r Al@@ var@@ enga , to stand beside him and to read Editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists like &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held them in favor of intelligent , but did not stick with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who listened to , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; , &quot; so they thought Al@@ var@@ enga , who would speak to the indigenous group of Re@@ viol@@ i , home again to their native tongue . &quot;
&quot; they feared their Lord that they had made the formation , which they had enabled them to lose again , &quot;
&quot; but it was totally clear that she had got for everything they got from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ enga had discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing that is almost never talked about , are bullying and the har@@ ass@@ ists who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ c when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I could invite anyone to go home . I had no friends in school or neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
the Company cheaper the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go

social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislation dict@@ ate Egyptian users of social media to register at the government
&quot; picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain C@@ C@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed on a bill to &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use of &quot; &quot; social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is adopted by the Parliament , the beneficiaries and user of social media in Egypt must register in a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; based on the law , then a place would be set up , which is to be charged to educate citizens and use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register to the user &apos;s website with their proper name and personnel numbers , to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; is it failed to do so , so that could bring a penalty up to six months imprisonment or spending money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragrap@@ hs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others using voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ers and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should accept the pay@@ ers that the Egyptian government is not able to accept the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul cant@@ ar , Spe@@ aker of parliam@@ ent@@ arians and Pat@@ rons of the Legisl@@ ative Council , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and a password &quot; &quot; from the telecommunic@@ ation Ministry , and a password &quot; &quot; by the fire@@ wall to get on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook , due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not so far known that such plans exist . &quot;
experts on the site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; leading research ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I do not doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things which have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could control non @-@ violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will establish a strong monitoring system in order to apply for citizens who require a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a trial process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative process and the constitution , before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement is to be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is controlled and ensured that no devi@@ ation of the sc@@ ars is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MPs called Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a lifel@@ ong sentence for those provided to be found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish nature prot@@ ector protects the Persian leop@@ ard in Iraq from the war

&quot; the Todd Re@@ ub@@ old post was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this paper is published as part of a agreement on content sharing . &quot;
high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq work the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ er H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation of Nature to protect the gho@@ stly Persian leop@@ ard .
&quot; a sub@@ species of the bigger family of leop@@ ards , which stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ ory species in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and the plumage of the ecosystem also depends on that there is a great carni@@ v@@ ore . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard is really small and goes against zero . as the team in the video makes it clear that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera all that breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a educated Biolog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about a different side of their country which does not only consist of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies at wild animals and in educational programs of Nature Iraq .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protective areas for wildlife in the region Kurdistan .

&quot; early March 2017 documented that for the nor@@ theastern Japan , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a tremendous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , Pre@@ fecture , Pre@@ fecture , Pre@@ fecture , the Pre@@ fecture of Japan had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
&quot; even more to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture lived a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had already had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local perspective which progress has been achieved six years after the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese re @-@ construction authorities as well as pol@@ l results for those affected by themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the scheduled sub@@ divisions ( according to the presence of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , and Iw@@ ate were finished in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures could record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate 75 per cent of such houses is finished , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is a total of 70 percent with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , it is still possible to res@@ ett@@ lement six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( who ) , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final sub@@ stitu@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; according to the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in subj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate lived in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of 2011 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ ebooks , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful at Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , which are explored after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , have been reloc@@ ated to final houses . &quot;
for Iw@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected Pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , its doors opened until December 2016 , which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ tures are much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of fisheries are now in operation in Iw@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fisheries are re@@ recorded . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn up in the three pre@@ fecture of agricultural land large @-@ sized in co @-@ workers . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of arable land in Iw@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear cl@@ usal area . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered again and again Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains a long way back . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate are again at 90 percent on the same level as of the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only 75 percent be found here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast inhabitants , it was more difficult to feel a living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine the picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how its sensation has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in its introduction of the article explains the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population of experience .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5,@@ 9 per cent of respon@@ dents said that still not enough in matters of disasters have been done . &quot;
how it is for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture .
&quot; in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper has directed its attention to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture , was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atomic disorder , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were moved into areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 something more than 23 000 people had been converted back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the date of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres have been older than 50 years old . they have to be returned in proper homes because the efforts are competing for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here it is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if you meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the common@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; however , after a while one sees often that one more connects than it appears at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics , which often get fewer attention in the reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the common@@ alities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini has explained how a migration has strengthened its affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; Adri@@ ana Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he gathered in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been given this week into the intensive care station : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke stock against the head . nation@@ wide participated millions of protesters on a protest campaign against as@@ parag@@ us .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ ität Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n trauma and several questionn@@ aires . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and have now moved it into an artificial coma .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread within a few days fast in Brazil .
on the pictures also the face of the police officer will recognize that with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás was known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had suspended up to the conclusion of the examination of the incident from the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land in the intensive care station , his face would be seen six months on television and the whole oppression would be justified with that . &quot;
&quot; Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided the video on the net where one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edic briefly to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , internet users now don@@ ated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) , in order to stay a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás to memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he was attacked the Occ@@ up@@ y movement in Sek@@ und@@ ar@@ ira . and now we have attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva where he was attacked by an officer who has attacked him with a stroke stock .
police over@@ head
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it occurred on the last Friday to brutal police force against protesters .
&quot; polic@@ emen were at protest in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mi@@ ties and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers on violence against protesters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media is prot@@ ested by focusing on another , un@@ awa@@ ited protagon@@ ists : a window of window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo adapted specifically to design an illustr@@ ative glass window in order to illustr@@ ative the title page with a photo .
on the other hand the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a brand by fire .
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window screen than the protests of thousands of people that serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this is also necessary to recognize if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; here also , the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives a absur@@ dity , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by the title &quot; protesters on a fron@@ tage &quot; with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the Ab@@ induc@@ tion forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law by Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar mills in all Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , regardless of which there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in sugar mills were l@@ ah@@ m@@ ated .
&quot; after the earth , the sugar industry stood still in the region and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changed the work .
&quot; others res@@ ig@@ es , and com@@ mu@@ te every day to the factories that ex@@ h@@ orts . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , which is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry does not smoke its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar mills , which are again in operation after a long time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he was not expecting .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds me exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar industry was already res@@ isted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar was produced less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
the message would have been a motive for liber@@ alisation of the country some decades ago but the bad fl@@ ushes are already no novel@@ ty more .
why has the Cuban sugar industry have been shut down ?
the old railway line of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar@@ s industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar @-@ products were technically dated and almost competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on the production of the most efficient plants , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar plantations and the rise rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price came back over a decade ago .
&quot; from 2017 through 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; agricultural brochure &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) the commodity export of around 85 million dollars would act for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on began the restructuring of restructuring in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the down@@ turn came from a total of 98 sugar@@ s , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the Cher@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; thus , the place is preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first grade Year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents , which were removed only in terms of parts that would be removed , addressing the add@@ res@@ sat and the date . &quot;
they were all signed by Ul@@ ster Ros@@ ales del Toro but the Minister could appro@@ ve any rem@@ uner@@ ation .
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more common . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years for the still@@ aked factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation of sugar @-@ engine@@ ered sugar@@ s .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the st@@ on@@ ation of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industry range from Cuba and the most important job producers has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the labour market and services , which were generated in the communities in which they were , created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw , when he guaranteed that for the regions , whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would be well run . &quot;
the price of the population at the closure of the sugar@@ s products
since 2004 sugar is only extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who changed many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar factory closed , or rather than they began to disman@@ tle it , they also listened to the road to paved , this disadvantaged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy have had to look up other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspective , many young people were involved in the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ in@@ und@@ forty hei@@ ghtened the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month , in order to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a rep@@ uted person , nonetheless he gives the lies that you told him . &quot;
they have known him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ent , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they are doing by hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ on tour since 2014 workshop leader Mobile Ton@@ studios bring directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach you@@ ths song@@ writing , recording , audio @-@ production and video production . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop makes it possible for the young participants in discussions such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ suffici@@ ency , &quot; or whatever it comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ chen@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears . &quot; &quot;
the cases were largely ignored .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences from globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people were not always mut@@ ated by the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation was recorded , the chorus is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ olly of the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available in writing , as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in .
but I try to go on Earth for my days
&quot; this is the day , where you will take our scre@@ am &quot;
because we lost our way in life as youth
&quot; however , I believe that we will rise to one day &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward as well as our youth
how can they do that which they have determined the Creator

in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; according to a typical restaurant in Japan , made of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is standing on the menu , will be issued close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ ma@@ pur@@ u ( where to display plasma models of the dishes &quot; ) from any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they set the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually such a thing that they do not even create them once more . a new trend is transformed into show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ cu@@ es . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic straps decorated mobile lig@@ aments , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , cool@@ ed magne@@ ts : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ck@@ out cool@@ ed magne@@ ts for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ tions is increasingly becoming more sophisticated .
in this case a ca@@ vern @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile @-@ stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that supports your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the cell phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
this is only the beginning of an increasing flight to the Com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and salmon @-@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can install my mobile phone with salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic stores can also take a less appe@@ al@@ able form to surprise for example colleagues or family members uncomfortable .
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting snow .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be found under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 0@@ ies , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , dedicated to the sk@@ e@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ cu@@ ff . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of national and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against the drug trade &quot; in Mexico the missing and driven regularly only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely to the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , anyone looks at the bere@@ av@@ ed or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories paid , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose sor@@ es may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore the Mexican news portal is called Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trafficking &quot; ) , to give these sacrifice a voice and stories of people who were told in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime cannot be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to drive whole communities to buy some kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bo@@ p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who got every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who on only one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; how every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today , which we have asked for , to go , and to graves , after the people we have loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you stand out of the insurance of my Father , but they don &apos;t get paid , because that demand an exchange of death . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state management . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been aware of disease and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I pass this day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images , which actually only stem from a text@@ book for criminals or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to it or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will , if it is great . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders if they go through roads . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they mo@@ cks those who have lost someone and those who are afraid of doing so something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories appear to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to conc@@ eive that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : like a family with dru@@ g@@ ations , it describes how the armed criminals were black@@ ed for month money from their business until the end of not only the business was destroyed , but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; pain never goes beyond , the trauma remains , the fear comes up once again when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed ; phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would dis@@ solve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The Un@@ forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the proposed generation of violence .
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions like : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach yourself how to make an egg cooks , potatoes br@@ es , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the surface with water , sugar and dairy powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for all the life of violence and had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , who saw bloody sor@@ es of his father being shot by armed men from a pre @-@ prop@@ elled car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence caused by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murder for public safety and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secution said 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few of hundreds of stories , which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetr@@ ate into the soul of the country . &quot;
only a few stories live on to the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 called the data journ@@ alism @-@ project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective has been tor@@ tured behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has been tor@@ tured in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the pages that it is linked , contain images where violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about lifting an ru@@ mor , or a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time is sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist . &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was irre@@ conc@@ tive to use trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that it gives much careful reporting on events in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it raises questions about our demand for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a pet@@ rol station crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , ti@@ pped up and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war in Africa a second largest country had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of stro@@ kes , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically it occurred to the victim of the pet@@ rol .
&quot; bureaucr@@ acies described a fire@@ ball , the used homes , including a cinema in the proximity , which was full of people who dict@@ ate the world championship . &quot;
houses were scattered and glu@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ pret@@ ti@@ bility .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users mysti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multi@@ more photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it displays ranks of the stolen body , which are open on the ground while people are watching them . &quot;
but here history is not its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but are not associated with the trage@@ dies in the context of the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 warri@@ ors of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the dra@@ ined villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities before they flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse in streets and hedge .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a local human Rights Watch . &quot;
many have been cr@@ ushed or burned .
only using satellite models could be pic@@ tured .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved but the army @-@ based conflict in B@@ aga has been a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
&quot; and here the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is up , as it mistak@@ enly presents as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a massacre in 2.000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of Congo is only one in a series of failures , Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the image was presented as a proof for mass@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; still a step further bring personal comments such as this , mistak@@ enly the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge entered into Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ sts as the following on whom these descriptions have brought together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ an Arab news site , which was declared in 2012 that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein said , monks and politicians would have taken part in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to read this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , the AFP for their source , also had wron@@ g@@ ly written to this statement , but did not agree with the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo . &quot;
the global range of false information
traces of this wrong coupling cl@@ amp range up to the years 2011 and 2012 are actually coming back from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; reverse picture @-@ search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( from 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a combination of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed up false reports , others have tried to dism@@ iss the f@@ eit@@ s . &quot;
&quot; we have adopted examples of abu@@ sive use and associated with the respective countries , on which side they have been published . thus , we want to display the range clearer than by the language alone . &quot;
the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) may have several examples of abu@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be fully prepared ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cop@@ pers of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point on the sides or servers that are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ tional messages .
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ kli@@ fts . &quot;
&quot; remember , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( he was directed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of the threads to the &quot; &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; this post , which addressed himself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is NOT a Muslim to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
this news site asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein was admitted to 2012 that monks and politicians were participating in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students created by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by now deleted , the cath@@ o@@ lic near the news site An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities did not find these events , the mut@@ agen@@ ess in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was f@@ ath@@ ered as evidence of the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were taken up in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) and 2014 .
&quot; after a message that was alleged to have been written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , there was discussion circles like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to the wrong message . &quot;
&quot; from the Embassy , in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner missionaries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points out to other accounts , ag@@ gregate and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;

&quot; in all these cases , first appeared after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;

there are two strong issues or frames in frames . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in regards to bigger discussions about the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the per@@ ic@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is assessed in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion to want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe this pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally involved in doing the water around a tragedy . &quot;
suggests this mood of the inf@@ alli@@ ble and mis@@ mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in Nigeria and Myanmar ) ?
the spread of violent images has already been discussed in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the rejection of images of a ref@@ usal to perceive the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded of the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time there is concern that non @-@ violent images and audience des@@ ensi@@ tise , and to experience the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which seek to act like violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to be able to think about the situation in which a picture is sug@@ ated , which can actually be used also from the context or to completely mis@@ sive type . &quot;
any study of false grants should also be taken into account of how international it can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons was used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ replac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words can be found in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ matched words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ ot@@ esa ) .
but all resist obst@@ inate any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not sufficient , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is required to precisely understand what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find words from the VAT language of the country as follows :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Rem@@ ember for your parents in recognition of how to make yourself in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being exposed to cold days in the sun .
in Burma &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ ences other cultures , revealing other thought @-@ stran@@ ds and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have a influence on how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deal with the worst floo@@ d@@ age of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is at the moment the worst floo@@ d@@ - and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually uses the end of May , crosses the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ ed people are mixed because of the floods and slaughter . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) , and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas were slowly coming back . &quot;
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the sky@@ water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kas deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fever crisis , save save the Children , after further rainfall are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today , Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the floo@@ d@@ water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle are also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday har@@ p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five will be taken into the residents in their floo@@ ded villages included in their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and starters have agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ ts in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on ground@@ water and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and b@@ ail@@ mann@@ sions need threats to their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for high water @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call them today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ o centre is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me conducted a &quot; &quot; high @-@ water solution &quot; &quot; button that allowed the users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they led an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that included more than 1,000 requests and 150 successful bo@@ at@@ ability actions for a result of floo@@ ding and land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; the unified efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bringing residents in need of security and make assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human life , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas is now the long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims that can not see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
I was using the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear girlfriend at the Women &apos;s March .
&quot; I trust my four year old daughter , they trust me their children : it is my rock in the surf . &quot;
in the one minute we call for more slogans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ an@@ ation we tend to protect rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from a American flag , other sk@@ ill@@ ess slogans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have been working for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; that has built up in their idea . &quot;
they reb@@ elled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it , be Muslim to be on different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , Muslim . &quot;
dec@@ ei@@ zes to be dra@@ fted
I am not alone .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western presentation the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduced pictures of Moslems , Western books have been coloni@@ alist for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man , which should be afraid and the exotic woman who should be saved . &quot;
the triumph@@ ant Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward Said was killed in the 1970s the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures still stand forth today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are continuing . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , fla@@ wed narrative of our news feed@@ s . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the reality , which in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even vote their first female presidential office . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are hardened in public buildings and cover sour women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group keeps its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong cr@@ acy weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
it looks over that the first Muslim prayers were talking on American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought to by slave .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination for such deep and error that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ ophobia today not only fear of Islam , religion but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
belong to 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narrative that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and here we have failed , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents came to live in New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American stu@@ d from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan changed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were im@@ mortality Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ f@@ aded Muslim and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I am not a pork or I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , I tell my hand@@ hand@@ ker@@ chiefs who all Muslims wear on themselves - &quot; &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke we do not wear all pick@@ pockets with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological expert to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who seek to fight widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ produced Islam@@ ophobia , Thin@@ k Tanks and experts for folding information that is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we are telling them , Islam@@ ophobia is in more than just a stranger , who stri@@ ps a woman in the head . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the US , see below . &quot;

use approved .
I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as the Muslim , but to be a Muslim I was born to my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbor , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes . &quot;
&quot; she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter when I live in my arms , and called the Arab verses to protect the Koran , and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; please , I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil that you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging is the picture of my Grand@@ mother &apos;s maternal part with her sisters , as she has decades a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of it that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and one of Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which they can almost swi@@ vel . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim , to speak the prayers that they said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim , as she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ le , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who has been coloni@@ alized for centuries - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; , &quot; which a company was founded by the name of Hon@@ orary British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my grandfather &apos;s grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; end@@ rin while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ f@@ aded by his family in India , which he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know is that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , by coloni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim , to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have been colonial all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown out of a Muslim country over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , Kash@@ mir@@ an under@@ tan the British Empire , was named as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before the aircraft were , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remembering that four@@ teen years ago the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arctic , which were distributed over Iraq to chase weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half millions of Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans have risen since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
it means knowing that when a tragedy is home to the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name that will report the story four times more than a story with a white attack .
&quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years ago , the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slaves . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved , and brought to this land . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
&quot; it is the hope I feel when we get up for our dreams , and if we say black lives . &quot;
&quot; an American , a pact , a Kash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , an inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multiple identi@@ ties , but to fail they communicate to others . &quot;
&quot; the err@@ atic of 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ous , but it is represented in the reduced bi@@ d@@ iness &quot; &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother to care my child and to make all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this bi@@ dity structural Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; structural anti @-@ Islam consists of the Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in tran@@ sit@@ ory monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immig@@ rant officials , who takes over five years old child in handic@@ apped . &quot;
it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders opposite people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the sight .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw from Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ real picture and called them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the sli@@ ght@@ est score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to mention the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for decades , we come back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous substance prints that we relate to our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims inside the media industry , which is trying to grasp our often with attach@@ ments and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast See Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ ing ; S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ ing ; Zap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Gre@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increasingly Muslim authors , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global timing , in which we are . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown ex@@ pon@@ entially because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ entially by having created the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not been given them : now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and history , which I was not aware of when I was so old , as my daughter is now , but who today made me an in@@ um@@ erable Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a Br@@ ot@@ recru@@ iting track in my speech .
&quot; things which might spark memories because in all the interpretations that make up our humanity , likes a story , where someone is made to a &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; so why do I tell this at this TE@@ D@@ x talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who showed us how wars are being brought in and by the work of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public performance , four decades himself was Scientific of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of its , consciously and consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I bombar@@ ded in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , as he had already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; &quot; people , &quot; &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ art wants to preserve Urban diversity
&quot; stor@@ y@@ telling , of Flick@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the count of stories in their original language is a possible response to that . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported short about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ brid@@ geable Blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and to appreciate . &quot;
&quot; in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born children . &quot;
for the creators of the project are :
&quot; mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we manage cities to assume diversity - secure spaces , where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening is often associated with it , &quot; &quot; those events instead listen to &quot; &quot; the list@@ eners to feel , to feel , to make . &quot;
in this format historical stor@@ yt@@ eller presents their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , they lead their devotion and their account to that the list@@ eners should be involved . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain the stories of typical customs of narrative for their country . &quot;
in a different event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of the har@@ es and b@@ abo@@ ons in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after he explains the meaning of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
you were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller . &quot;
Puerto Rico also calls for the US re @-@ fixing of the state debt
&quot; the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , dedicated to 72 million US dollars , involved in various religious and civil organisations on a mass demonstration ; the march started in the pu@@ ert@@ orial Capit@@ ol , the office building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was declared by the group &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( the front for the neur@@ ons of debt ) and the &quot; &quot; Puerto Rico &quot; &quot; assembly of Puerto Rico . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the debt of debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico call for the politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a guid@@ eline without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate rem@@ uner@@ ation that acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will pres@@ st and supp@@ resses .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt , which is not its . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state of state @-@ integrated territory of the USA - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economic &quot; , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to an existing state @-@ view . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be at risk without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration wor@@ e the name &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;

&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continued the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions that he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , devoted himself an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist Director of France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , includes a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book will discuss how movements will be built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are working on the movements for free knowledge to look over the m@@ ist who surrounds our News@@ feed@@ s and to create a little sense of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted in the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
we have since then no information on his current state or location .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book will be with the title &quot; &quot; collective memory &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice who want to know for his liberation , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ ket pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
why did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for sy@@ r@@ ischer government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was removed from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ ket had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as in@@ sider of the Assad government and put them into knowledge by a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his abi@@ ding and condition remain unknown but still unknown .
&quot; a prec@@ ursor of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in bringing access to Internet and knowing the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of the bas@@ al cultural prototypes were pres@@ cient than the work which he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the junction of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would place all that architecture that not only represents the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip train into the digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
trag@@ ically this project could not yet complete .
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison , &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call its name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English with me even when he was already in prison .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him . he has taught other prisoners , read English , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theoretically without being able to hold one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a sab@@ bath that she wrote in the years 2012 to her husband when he was in prison . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a long time .
they smug@@ gle the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is roy@@ alty @-@ free .
account@@ ant of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens with every visit ;
&quot; that I disp@@ lease in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the b@@ ending in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers do not matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the fences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I would like to speak in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion for me , &quot;
when your eyes fail to say
and I set another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; coming back quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to take back all the moments
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I am witn@@ essing myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; a year goes , my soul &quot;
during the day
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5.000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the force of violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in detention since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat today our call in the hope that we have to do so for the last time .
Mozambique : because of corruption and the director of disclaim@@ er again on previous post
Mozambique has responded with wrath to a corruption drop in which a government member returned after half of his prison sentence in the state apparatus by which the corruption was committed .
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
the money was made from public funds from Mozambique to Mos@@ ambique from the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested his re @-@ setting into the company , which took place on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Council of the Republic , which had filed an application , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ b@@ aza , to refer back to its old post , as the company does not fully implement discipl@@ in@@ arity according to his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , sentenced in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to restore the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clearly identi@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we need to take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the contra@@ sting characters .
&quot; however , the firm seems to be a reasonable legal steps for applying the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , reject this behavior as well as &quot; war@@ dly &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and received half of it . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could be advised and pol@@ ishing his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to re@@ integrate into the company that he helped harm . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is happy to be silent for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of policy economics in Brazil says , he would have no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he refused to believe , I can not believe that one has already rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only serves the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ es it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man , which was charged before and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only as the first independent president , but also as sharp , l@@ apping and - inci@@ dentally , prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he was energetic confirmed that &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being capable of all , also the father@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know whether a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that which is not so . he does not alter the tactics , but he does not address his ambitions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ appro@@ ving :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; today , the company , in which he is putting money again , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ hau@@ te ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users to injustice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ se or Sp@@ age .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
according to Facebook users in Myanmar the well known Social Network took their posts from the net because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; May &quot; &quot; in Bur@@ m@@ ical writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radic@@ ally nation@@ alistic movements given the word an extremely valuable con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word which is most commonly used by Ultra @-@ nationalist as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight at Al @-@ Has@@ ish language in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ mag is usually associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically calling for hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the purpose of his use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ ic also called &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age axis ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the fac@@ ebook@@ uses A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether it could be sha@@ king how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain , by doing a vocabulary . &quot;
the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ gment ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win , the opinion is that it will reduce hate speech from radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook analytical must be analytical before it all po@@ sts ext@@ ingu@@ ishing in suspici@@ on of racism , racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
&quot; the automatic dis@@ m will not understand , what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ aged ) .
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ minute nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , have received quite a good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to circumc@@ ised their nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , the relationship @-@ hate language may not be spread for a long time , the efficiency of this strategy may not hold long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often become a K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to clear his po@@ sts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; has been ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post office to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited by the li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or that simply try to show their opinions against the hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his mind about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative to ask for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to dimin@@ ish racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words lead to cens@@ ored only even more hatred within the various communities .
it seems as if they have started it without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the po@@ unded po@@ sts deleted . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly greater respect for the 15 million benefits , making them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has taken care of much sp@@ ott among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are removed from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that have no inc@@ it@@ ement , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission to use .
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film . &quot;
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to extend their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks have to be hei@@ ghtened in addition to violence in Myanmar , especially in the fields of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Moslems and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to critic@@ ise the di@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
&quot; but instead of simply putting the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would be better running , more likely to have focused on the context than on Code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
&quot; in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 , Tobago has concluded with the children &apos;s toe &quot;
a honey@@ moon in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the child @-@ toe is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously adopted a law that aims to ban this practice so that the store @-@ ready age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the Act , some members of Hindu and Muslim denom@@ inations took place in practice , and in May 2016 , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state did not interfere with that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has been a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s illegal Convention , the minority of min@@ ors than , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics show that the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago 2,@@ 8 per cent , and with 18 they were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical centre of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online @-@ peti@@ tions and social media movements that were stri@@ ves to abol@@ ish laws to inf@@ rin@@ gement , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hindu leaders , for example , had no concerns to say the cri@@ tic of the children &apos;s toe , they should remember , dam@@ n &apos;t care for their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition ass@@ ed for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts on whether the opposition would not all agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children of children - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law . &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave us a state @-@ update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again posted :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill for the children &apos;s trial was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no single one against it .
&quot; after he had previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the child @-@ toe had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vell Francis , who became a ministry of the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk used to the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is illegal and Tobago now illegal , and that is almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel , Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot;
the law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , vote - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ in@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which is part of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil@@ ised group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the healing age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation to 18 years .
&quot; the draft to change the Act was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law . &quot;
the child @-@ toe is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ par@@ rot .
many thanks to all activists who have completed him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our members .
&quot; a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; a few months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed , and it seems to dis@@ solve his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General Council Ad@@ voc@@ ate Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said it was quite legal , if Mahar@@ aj against the law wanted , the most social media users wish to address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; rather Sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion in general , in a way that only panic and dis@@ grace can cause , if we , instead of having to talk about the problem that the state , our daughters are protecting that they may be of great , hard @-@ bo@@ iled men who are in front of them , would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the inf@@ ancy in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they under@@ go . &quot;

through the mir@@ rors of web sites can view Turkish users back Wikipedia content
&quot; the English @-@ language page was released on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright laws in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey continued the popular and based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia .
&quot; day by day becomes clearer , how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information and to share . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are against the blocking .
&quot; although many techniques used internet users are used to use envel@@ oping tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has published articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Harvard University since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was passed . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently are updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer machine connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of legislation .
in a blog post reported IP@@ FS about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to specify snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least access all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia.@@ org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also given that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and just about screen@@ shots and no dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ side from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mir@@ ror@@ sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni told the h@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; there is no full copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; one is att@@ acking to another URL that is not the original . that &apos;s what you see , is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially the server manages the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
because this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor and washed colors .
the motivated him to take him a camera with themselves and try to grasp the situation .
at that time he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 years Sag@@ ar , Sag@@ ar , Nepal@@ ese endeav@@ ours to bring to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direc@@ ts the attention to Nep@@ as wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as to him this first class situation helps with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I found myself being at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) invited me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran up with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had seen him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to kne@@ eling images ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nep@@ ali nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fri@@ ghtening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he was standing tig@@ ers from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not interfere with the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was coming home because of the darkness in the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he immediately puts forward to seeing us and he star@@ ched me through the Sal trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ ali nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited 22 days long , and usually lived in a tent in order to take photos from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , which live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az Kaly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , originally published on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
an revised version was published again as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of consequences , they should pay the norm to life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a well @-@ installed and rejected by her family and the village community after they had addressed a &quot; secret relatives &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also did not call the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less assignments to fear , if at all , they should not come up with this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and were thus rapidly becoming the main ch@@ atty topic of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place for them only , where they discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the reduction of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of her video@@ camera with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how this clubs was created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made an ambassador for change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini had shown in its discussion , was the case of women who have not called their hus@@ bands on behalf of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that the women could easily identify with .
&quot; not to speak according to the names of their hus@@ bands , there is a bread that they all maintain all over and never put into question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition tes@@ tified that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is seen as a hus@@ k and as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never done thoughts on this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try to try her husband in the name until now , at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband are silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; practice , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video@@ projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; If we could not tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it be equivalent to it ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women never allowed to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she just sat down during the whole exercise ; another decided to let the whole desired frustration against him and his family , by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in adrenal@@ in@@ toxic@@ ation about , having broken with an ancient bread , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini got a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the woman in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner prior to the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
&quot; a husband of a participant in was less understanding , and the situation was composed of violence . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ ate : &quot;
why do women just need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear a red spot if he was doing it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard about wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not ended completely with it , but they mean they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we take a trip on each panel . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to make sure who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have already made some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are bound to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion @-@ round we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have been carried out in the group since their marriage .
&quot; for most of them this is okay , but some wanted a salad @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a pants , wearing ; they have not drunk . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own wardrobe , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , smug@@ gled Roh@@ ini had their own pair of course ( Upper shirts ) into a panel discussion so that the women could carry them . &quot;
next have they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to create it .
&quot; the question , whether in the five months have already been a bit changed since their first discussion , confirms Roh@@ ini that things slowly get into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; some , included , make it still , but only if they are alone and are not members of the family members . &quot;
&quot; only one or two will continue to tell the name of their hus@@ bands , only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead . &quot;
women in the discus@@ sion@@ lu@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the arrow in order to get more freedom of movement or their own clo@@ sets - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; by giving other self confidence , make them aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how raw ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
&quot; but in this club , each of us gives us confidence that something will change . &quot;
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and other people are reported what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ amorous men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the target of suicide for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 was conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate these practitioners .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices . &quot;

in the last days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ gers arm sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , which indicates that the problem is part of major social difficulties which Mos@@ ambique : &quot;
&quot; I would like to do E@@ IN Mozambique , TH@@ AT S@@ I would like to go to the street when the teachers would not viol@@ ate sex against good notes , work and other services to make their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic , &quot; will be hun@@ ted in which people will aim to get snow @-@ out wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of them could not miss out the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ing humor . &quot;

&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably only recently made . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese disc@@ ard Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer at the end of June had announced that he had been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) , after he calls for the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which democratic reforms in China had been involved . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a speaker , he said it is not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ red on the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to allow Li@@ u abroad for treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to Sto@@ cks , after winning the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government did not realize that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon @-@ line to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee carried his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to deliver Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us on how to release them in an explanation on June 30 . &quot;
we expect at the same time that China cover all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
&quot; they are to meet all visits and receive , which they wish , and be able to freely communicate with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans want &quot; &quot; to give him the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary and Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AFP on June 27 , that the message left the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia by their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the U.S. Embassy moved to an angry response from China to , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple of interest :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel arrangements and access to medical care of his choice , to which it is entitled to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also have introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to pushing Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditionally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditionally so that he can embar@@ k in proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; the German government Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u has received all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president of Xi Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the News Agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concern whether the vor@@ tex for Li@@ u could be overwhelmed by the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador to John McC@@ all@@ um was requested to provide China to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to worry about his family .
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ walt told AFP for the fact that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always over@@ sees the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Li@@ u with someone outside , including his lawyers to speak and contact us . &quot;
McC@@ all@@ um tells you about :
&quot; Canada is calling for China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to preserve and to the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry demanded China in an Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures have to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receive all treatments which he needs , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family will have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info reported that French government Li@@ u would be welcome in the country , announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that there is no further information to see if France will eventually take him up . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of festivities in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Li@@ u on 27 June and to show greater tolerance to those seeking political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese Legisl@@ ation Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Socialist Party also called for China to allow to treat the sick intellectual Li@@ u , to treat themselves in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June um Li@@ u , and gave them that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellbeing . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was strictly punished to have had a harmonious , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent in China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and interested citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;

&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , she was supposed to be a city at the beginning of Singapore as a city . &quot;
this remark has raised a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Association of Law@@ yers of the State of New York , the Minister , that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore in other countries . &quot;
it ass@@ ists that Singapore should be considered a city .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ ops accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable country , you can say that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded as vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory inf@@ rin@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of its , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; however , he defended the idea that Singapore was compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ we@@ er emerges from the authorit@@ arian powers that will give up democr@@ ats , leaving the tw@@ isted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; during the final week , the were given the answers to his American guests on our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ Ans@@ wers . &quot;
corresponding questions were burned with non @-@ responses rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks for the smug@@ gle at the beginning to clarify his mind as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our more than K Shan@@ smug@@ gle would take on the effort to clarify this point where he was paid highly , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out regarding the reviews that you should start to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that in order to better understand the context of the statements from Shan@@ smug@@ gle at the better , according to which Singapore was a city and no country . &quot;
read the co @-@ ordin@@ ance .
&quot; as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equally important , even if we enjoy free and just choices . &quot;
he founded Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw decades a party win ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not work in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ smug@@ gle at the beginning , representing as a leader of a growing generation , which makes this polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ smug@@ gling , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes it really is properly associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review makes the vulner@@ ability of the Shan@@ smug@@ gling arguments :
has Mr Shan@@ gh@@ ti@@ bly committed a mistake by the &quot; ben@@ believer or was it a Freu@@ dian understanding ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
if not what country will go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ acts are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the govern@@ ors share their military service , but do not defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city : &quot;
I have not said what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many parts of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always have a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your homeland or homeland ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , sorry , I answered . &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and re @-@ lived in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the discussion is taking place , it is considered polite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then the standard answer is then usually the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans are perhaps bo@@ ast@@ ful before anger , when they are held to Americans but don &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little , that distingu@@ ishes the Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons , why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag easily to its ru@@ ck@@ sack when they travel . &quot;
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
but the Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le blades on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ itely .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be regarded as the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; I would not make any thing about myself , if you would change myself with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; however , there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , as &quot; nice &quot; means to be , is basically to be sp@@ ook@@ y - as well as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no no@@ o@@ ks and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; harmless , means in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to make no attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if one wants to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that are going around for around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often speak about the fence along with its neighbours .
&quot; we are missing the warm , open kindness which I have with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au performed the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our Prime Minister has had Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ves Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ ves , which took the power in 2014 and restore the civilian government in spite of its promises , the country is governed . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about what rules make him his girlfriend .
&quot; although not specifically political , the music video refers to the continued military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was an amazing success .
&quot; within the first three days , this was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as special as it deals with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta domination .
&quot; once again , take a look at these shots of the video which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has un@@ wa@@ vering over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the wire section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gave an absolute decision to the commander of the army of an absolute decision @-@ making process of important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program to &quot; creation &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law concerning computer criminal , whose vag@@ ue and non @-@ clear regulations are often used by authorities to reject activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army which monitors on @-@ line content and people who have thrown the monarchy , the monarchy is per@@ secuted , pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand is made up of a stri@@ ction against &quot; L@@ ese maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ en@@ s@@ ling ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was established in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pro@@ secuted , is their decision expensive sub@@ boats to purchase , although security experts were warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax evasion . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car , before it brings them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem case . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they are alleged &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and internet users will face long adhesi@@ on , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which im@@ itate the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;

the post @-@ war society was recovered very slowly in East @-@ Min@@ or especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian war was officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ di@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ kov are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ate , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and se@@ mit@@ es live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called Ge@@ ister@@ ial in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
&quot; even more than 10,000 people lived here in the pre @-@ war period , today there are only a few hundred people in these branches . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people had hardly increased since 2011 . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ kas are symbo@@ lically called for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are dis@@ closed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; it all is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community served . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union in the meantime .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ kas , which can still accommodate one or two families , one recogni@@ zes on the balconies , where laundry dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph them , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered with her girlfriend and suddenly she abandoned the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ ist@@ enz@@ l industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as livestock , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the laps .
the district administration is in winter free candles and bread to the villages .

Gal@@ ina does not wish to accept financial aid from her daughter and insisted that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
&quot; but we cannot do this continually - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears in the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her to her . &quot; she said , we could mount zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;

&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day they remember the village of Dor@@ fle@@ a before the war .
&quot; despite the relative , which live in Central , Os@@ se@@ tien and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

the young family has their own farm .
&quot; in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as kinder@@ gart@@ ens found once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .

in Mexico it houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acking was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org website , and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the path of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the m@@ ex@@ ican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is guided by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink glasses @-@ frame and gold colored ear@@ rings in Teddy B@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; she is called the Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with grinding , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are here .
&quot; sometimes , MS Ram@@ í@@ rez , people get in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast start to call it : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you m@@ um Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
it does not want to reject any one .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication that they can not pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that exhausted them from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ go@@ che ) with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ush .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find his husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take one first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells me that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel the route and that Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for construction of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ en , he began his trip to the United States . &quot;
for months he has been guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the bu@@ cket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you their guests often send their text messages if they have gone to gr@@ asp@@ ing them or to tell you about the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian faith was the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter is based on Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
he is poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the B@@ usti@@ ble to numerous African migrants are to be sold expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking center outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was instruc@@ ted after a raid on his working site from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he was f@@ lown in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ ma@@ ze him out of him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he was asked for an accommodation and a unknown , an singles out , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family lives still there , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses the travelers will consult their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests a large part from Somalia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems very happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother gave them a lot of photos in their album .
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair care that has made her a customer satisfaction , some photos of her grand@@ kids and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sad while she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , repe@@ ats it every time . &quot;

&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the cell phone users received in the Tian@@ shan District of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi a cell notification , in which it indicates the district Government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , the app is said to have access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities must also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , shortly after they installed the app , messages with a private private chat group had been exchanged . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app for the sources and the distribution of terrorists would determine and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system @-@ categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a wide range of ways .
&quot; for example , the remote control &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; or even h@@ acker can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it out of it . &quot;
this introduction is in accordance with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports of digital cens@@ orship in China will mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , crow@@ ding ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme quot@@ ations and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ bran@@ ching internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; published on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ lets &quot; Images from the China &quot; ( National Park Association ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were then deleted if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensures that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification called for the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; the people were forced to use devices , which are meant for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity through the Aw@@ ak@@ ening Technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Uni@@ ons &quot; &quot; ) , which also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can raise the password values of a Windows operating system and thus unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city of party to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
&quot; all government agencies , public authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when running their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities released on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi to register their &quot; &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police station . &quot;
&quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . however , this action is viol@@ ated the personal rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible profits , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ am after death &quot;

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ate that you &apos;re all alone in a place where everything has gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has changed gradually , and reveals a truth which is clearly visible , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all glory .
one that has been cr@@ ushed down in a list of feelings and phrases that do not allow a metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if you are taking the reality again and behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and performers - turn the characters into beings from meat and blood , and everything scre@@ am after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are solved in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . it is clear that you &apos;re caught here between the walls that have built your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have taken me and my father three times , but I have not yet reached so that I would form &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security service it was formed - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he put his power over us , showing even the simplest concepts , which we knew . &quot;
five teenagers were demol@@ ished during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it came out so that the city was cr@@ ushed the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; cov@@ eted all the districts , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I did not put a high demands on a city that is assigned to the arteries , with state safety and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply to stop in the neighborhood .
&quot; I crossed the silence , by giving several times &quot; &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ ah . &quot;
I heard my voice caused by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we con@@ feder@@ ate to a gorgeous image that filled my expectations full and full . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you are free of the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the scent . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can take up , nothing can give you your voice out , after you have seen her all the way to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there , as I was now . &quot;
&quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ is@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear me how you are &quot; &quot; Almighty &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his hate @-@ filled eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; and you feel really what I look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was due to my fol@@ ly , vanity : maybe on the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure my thing as I replied : &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I am not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary , and his father immediately with it . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately , with this . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition lies mine until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a sou@@ l@@ ish torture which I was suspended monthly . &quot;
I cry out the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; after that , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells . &quot;
I imagine all the details exactly before I super@@ vised the room .
&quot; unlike otherwise , they have probably assigned a larger cell in this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and may immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I attacked an old proven communication method : with the fist to beat the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ com@@ rade was an &quot; &quot; sth@@ eses &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he responded to me ultimately . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells lay a decent man @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there can be no mark@@ et@@ tive facial features , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice sounds similar to that ? &quot;
all answers have had one of its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would do it if I ab@@ ide . &quot;
liar .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , to distribute all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening , always around that time the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I have always convinced that black is the colour of destruction , until I saw the yellow light that introduced us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ unders &quot; , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; with this , the secret was lifted up : to protect the state security before us and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ ou@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al ticket and betra@@ yed the close attention of their world@@ view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a land ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vised the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet to Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he is coming to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , which looks for him , &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can begin to connect to this day and to protest on demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
&quot; I used to get used to , not to reply . &quot;
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication means .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I have to get used to it or to get used to it , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your exec@@ ution@@ er will be rejo@@ icing on your scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; give him the pleasure ; you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not fall enough , which is why they used the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first capture , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage dump earlier , or whether it was included in the normal work site . &quot;
&quot; they had t@@ win@@ ed four cables to each other , in order to present us from their perspective , great invention of a huge cabinet . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them change , while I still was in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and found no favor because it is the next to an electric up@@ loaded stand .
&quot; flow through my entire body , enough to provide my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which lay stretched on the ground , was the perfect pow@@ ders . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this probably must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
some hours went that came to me like minutes .
then the call to dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light filled the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a creative youth , &quot; My Lord , my father has to worry fear@@ ful worries . &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free speech and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time in the morning ; sometimes he s@@ lows down to his canvas , times to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover .
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which had been among them in 1967 ; the year , in which Israel did its occupation of the West Bank to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ im@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a im@@ passion@@ ed activ@@ ist , facing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned their well @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often deal with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian mur@@ ders , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are found not only in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders , and he can also feel according to his own statement by the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he he@@ ars a special issue to American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed &quot; of the second generation - even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own life circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water sol@@ ves Nes@@ café on two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; during that time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramad@@ an is illegal .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand has a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
basically talk the sle@@ eved of hot coffee and the c@@ rests of k@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first place of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as drinking in the public during the Ramad@@ an water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has told the appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary elections , which support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ gers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , speaks of the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former press brie@@ fing in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; &quot; straight &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Syrian spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activ@@ ism which represents the old and proven legitimacy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to be campa@@ ig@@ ning for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually a clear cryst@@ all@@ ine reality reflected in Jordan , which appears to be clear in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender equity to glue by having his vision formed by the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skeleton of a apparently ill @-@ settled woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those , who actually should trust . &quot;
in the past years Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ de &quot; in Jordan - the un@@ official outside left .
&quot; according to the UN Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary nations achieved their peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women , the victims of killing or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on inter@@ ruption of control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to risk of internal violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , and the guarantee on the part of the family is needed that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is also known to get back to issues that are long considered tab@@ u in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b cont@@ ests that his work is political , however , is that he puts his music , the full explicit touching of sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I became aware of politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which , in its words , &quot; what one wants &quot; &quot; - be it &apos;s faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ sexuality or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he noticed that there are hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay people and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ian online program RO@@ Y@@ A to notice that his comment has been torn out of the context , tw@@ isted and his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; says he . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b supports the arab@@ ic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance of homo@@ sexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu nu@@ des , a poet of the eighth century , which is still in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks for himself : if Abu Nu@@ ten , who should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ s , was able to write openly about homo@@ sexuality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the actual problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ial Kingdom , nothing new is that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took place several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason that they have expressed critical about the problems that were rooted in the country with deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in the face of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs opinion is according to the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has for@@ ged M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row but the path of progress - it looks for slow , oppres@@ sive and inner changes . it is certain that these changes are from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , as millions of other Arabs also dreams , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of being able to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is characterized by the help of music , art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , disputes and artificial species . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore also resist resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one is thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also recorded in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the strongh@@ olds , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years come up in the northeast , to force the Indi@@ genous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could pick us a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ ate . &quot;
I have been watching the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just visible .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true and yet to spend an astonishing way in this summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high ride was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; in@@ rarely were external appearance and body care as important as in this history , as they help to maintain the Peruvian youth of the crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dressing . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road @-@ consuming and illegal drugs are common@@ place . &quot;
a survey conducted in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and hence the quir@@ ky hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in the experienced hands of hairdres@@ sers to form these elaborate hair styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hairdres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts from each other to show , who can create from them the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available at the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to immer@@ se young people from learning their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of obtaining a training in hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the emerging possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March in March and reported on some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love brie@@ fs of gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the modified version of the fee &quot; love bot@@ ships to gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the post is published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love brie@@ fs to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , affection . &quot;
&quot; just this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga , from the Young La@@ art@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , young people to write gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare . &quot;
&quot; recently , her country was the venue of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement of F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered to be the sig@@ nat@@ ing of the peace treaty , as significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received for its mer@@ its to Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the colum@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way to speak from a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare who have lived in illegal camps for many years and wor@@ e their arms around the clock , must now integrate into the lives as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had accu@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare , it must now support its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and would have had to help integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands young people wrote letters - love bot@@ ships to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters in order to welcome them back in society .
the target of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare - which are to be handed in personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for aton@@ ement was created at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi to whom 2014 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; this declared that we love the people who love to write , on Valentine &apos;s Day of love &apos;s letters , but those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s plane , he told his love to share his love with people that was most urgent . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan to write songs full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters are showing that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make discourse about a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I &apos;d never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ l@@ ists entered the camp to communicate the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC emerged as they had done before in order to receive the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of shelter from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare ) saw , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the thorn sh@@ utter . &quot;
&quot; I still spoke to him and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they say ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I replied to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hopeless letter .
&quot; I have never written anything like this in my life , so I replied to it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished him completely and set me next to the pom@@ egran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry , sorry , all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter was to be , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger @-@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; but now , I know that there is a society out there that is waiting with open arms to us . &quot;
&quot; until now , I only learned how to handle weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a panel discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ideals , and gave an insight into their views about the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced the social injustice from the State to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to build us into a political party , we can help to create society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; those people who have never found hearing had never found hearing , and to recognize that the people I have often seen as monsters and had learned , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their life circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the land lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who have been killed , and so much damage , can give us something and a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
colum@@ bi@@ ans was prophes@@ ied by that after the dis@@ armament peace would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to reach the weapons to protest and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; from the F@@ ARC we now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all def@@ ender of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with horror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of Schw@@ ul@@ er men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that is like a D@@ amo@@ unted to over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q congregation is not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny , who had shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines after several months ago , after reports published , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , susp@@ icious que@@ er men , and they were hidden in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when it was grown , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which is why they moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group had experienced the gender equality of their country &apos;s wife , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; because of fear for their life , they drew the last analysis to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
&quot; one day I told me , that anyone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who stuck in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent her back to his Che@@ chn@@ ya friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents were made by the whole of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just there , I heard a few shopping pieces from the back of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , you sweat ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the final analysis in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything and started to cry .
the man was f@@ lown .
the women had an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two p@@ ples in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in what sick@@ wings were you put in - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ c@@ asian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
in the last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; sending me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absurd claims : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to say in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have body @-@ size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a stick around the neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and delivered them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later in the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a num@@ eric plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; once it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was lazy . &quot;
my human right @-@ justi@@ fiable friends checked the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was per@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you f@@ lown ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons , I do not want to offer their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something happened un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them , without recording me , without any credit card , without any anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash .
came in and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ el . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality but that is a tab@@ ular theme . &quot;
some of the traditional Cau@@ c@@ asian elements do I still wear in me .
&quot; so much as I wish , this soul barrier can not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person she reminds of her past - so on my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke to someone , who had saved the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during Ramad@@ an , he was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could not wait to wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has been experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are now even gay men recorded in this secrecy ?
&quot; Sabrina : a acquaint@@ ance of me says , there were just not many . &quot;
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives , to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be per@@ ished , you will show off their bodies on TV and claim that they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
understand ?
as if these people were not just gone but targeted to radi@@ ating themselves .
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I have just been one of the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown up beard .
there have been nothing new of them since .
they have just taken them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even though these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , there have been no reports so far . we would guess that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether this persecution and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wor@@ e my hair for long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny than I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to approach the &quot; &quot; civil isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were added ; I had colored lashes , carried the tube and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the Security Council of Sh@@ aria has never pushed me a hair .
&quot; in Gros@@ ny Theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mption : Khar@@ da , Khar@@ da . that means &quot; Sp@@ otte , not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , when they are making fun over sick . &quot;
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed in front of you , because they believed that you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they never lost me never h@@ unts and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this treasure time hold on ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister , he began to talk on morality concerning morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how the people in the city started to change . &quot;
&quot; he who ble@@ w up before and borrowed , and looked at one time with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic is constantly worse . &quot;
OC Media : what kind of activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , assem@@ bling , I transfer them to the hospital and help them to get Essen@@ es . &quot;
I do not have a p@@ enny for this .
I found this man even when I fl@@ ake refuge .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a Hid@@ al@@ go ?
Sabrina : this is Alban@@ ians .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no homo@@ sexu@@ als with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ aret have which , the Russians also have which , all over the planet , there are they - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , therefore it is unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during the Ramad@@ an - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think of Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty in men who love men , and they believe that you can move his generation to make more intimate experiences . but this is a loss . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , in order to be exact , different habitats . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and do not harm me for my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , I will be my personal intimate relationship here now , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancestors in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region is suffering from an un@@ usually high degree of unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there is a sharp increase in self @-@ moral . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August was the dist@@ ressing situation of the Arab Spring @-@ Nazi community in Iran , which is dominated by poverty and unemployment . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video held on YouTube has held the moments , after he had lit itself , firm . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ v@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activ@@ ist on site warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights released that this month is a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family F@@ athers , who felt helpl@@ ess and impot@@ ent due to the persecution by the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and unable to feed their families and to ensure a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab &quot; &quot; Arab @-@ Nazi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
the region in which a large part of the Arab ancestors living in the Arab Republic of Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to strive for their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
&quot; in front of a century , the Arabic pedi@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i Mon@@ archy took over power and under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the gene@@ alog@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the busi@@ est and most valuable agricultural areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the native population only gets little from that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs , systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dem@@ on , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot;
these com@@ bs have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation caused in the region by drought and the local agriculture as well as to destroy the local agriculture and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ youth now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a further school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ als among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ men . &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has recently become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
&quot; since the function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to set the Arab labour force , the local Arab ancestors will be depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance , young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pros and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , and to be ques@@ tioned as the Arabic names are not tolerated in the workplace , because the speaking of Arabic language or the carrying Arabic language . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , who have to endure the Arab ancestors , human rights activists alert , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoidable .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als . &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under C@@ C@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide , and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed . &quot;
you can be read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even set up well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; for example , women are still less money despite same education than men . &quot;
women are still under str@@ ingent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women live sooner or later in various fields of life , and that discrimination based on the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware of and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I am double and triple underneath .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black transi@@ ent women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q congregation , or on black women from the Diaspora , when I have chosen , both in and outside the feminist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , that in addition to sexual violence there is an institu@@ tion@@ alized form of racial motiv@@ ates , which we are exposed to black women . &quot;
&quot; or that , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and proven@@ ance will make less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all the women , all the men and all men of any skin colour ; on the other hand , I cannot connect as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands to consider the inj@@ us@@ tices contained in their mind , which refers to the gender as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere called me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in historical respect , a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alised being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to give white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin colour and gender , because some of them continue to keep the meaning of black women for feminist movement not to be dead , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ism was established to give women different herds a home and bor@@ dering themselves from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely of femin@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women with us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ alth ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) , that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ists are immediately calling for separ@@ atism and exclusion , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ crisy and contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am acknowledged as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life was not over@@ passed , nor ignored . &quot;
kay@@ ak against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; the post of Todd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
&quot; in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution of his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # christ@@ mas bow ) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons concerned .
&quot; a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had been active against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of its relationship a little time has passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena , because of distr@@ acts , also showed the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman later drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women run at all once , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , the women also depend financially by the men that they mist@@ ru@@ ined . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to the victims of violence occur in case of law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Tem@@ ples and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ seen blo@@ ws and a legal system which is not under@@ estimated 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mist@@ re@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures available are however alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 at the District Council , 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads when police came to women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace gener@@ als . also here 86 % of the ads come from women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically susp@@ icious , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ otic mist@@ re@@ acts . &quot;
these statistics show however not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen female Minister of Ana Bai@@ ardi , only few of these offen@@ ders will actually be shown . &quot; on every woman who will not be ref@@ unded in Paraguay due to mental failure , 9 females who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; for every woman who will be ref@@ unded on every woman because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , stated in the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay is not a proprietary crime , law enforcement agencies cannot be adequately documented , how many women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
only until August 2016 journalists were elected at least 12 cases of genocide in the country alone .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman because of violence caused by men .

&quot; invisible offen@@ ders and a legal system , which has nothing to be signed &quot;
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do this , but after all . this was to always repent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but two years she carried the psych@@ ic power in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable by the most severe : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that only women are going to be under@@ estimated , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana social media to report on the assault by Carlos Vera .
&quot; called by name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described its ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told them how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
other Facebook users asked why they had fallen so long from Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
&quot; it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain compassion . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they mist@@ re@@ ated it . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women all in any way victims of failure .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic mist@@ re@@ acts .
&quot; their wealthy partner , it finally managed to convince them to convince them that they were worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads with authorities stayed without a result , and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against their former partners who developed into an im@@ penetr@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it mainly went about money , power and influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the statement of mis@@ acts is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
on 10 August 2016 a bill was deb@@ ated in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # inter@@ c@@ ession ) .
&quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ in@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ saving ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the original design of the law sees to explain to a unique criminal offen@@ ders and to pun@@ ish harder to pun@@ ish as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the legislative text was modified in some points , in order to also win MEPs for the law , which are feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are forbidden , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was provided , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) transaction costs that have to carry the victims of violence at present themselves , if it simply re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed just an indication and want to get a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the leg@@ is@@ lators does not provide sufficient financial means to do it : &quot;
in Paraguay it is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here a re@@ think must take place , so that violence is no longer considered anything Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts , is involved , and contributes to that the perpetr@@ ator will get away . &quot;
we have to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se this long ad until failure is no more than normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen per@@ ate was passed . however , parts of the law had been modified . however , among other things were a passage , which the partners in cases of domestic violence has been raised to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot;
&quot; the filing of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law applies however as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after pro@@ hibition of a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked due to a resolution of the information of the information Minister &quot; on the website of the promised paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than a year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arabian @-@ speaking paper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is a year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Num@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and asked before the court , but came back later . &quot;
&quot; Oman has ruled the power since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had set his father , Said i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; he dressed since then , in addition to its role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the central bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is marked by the persever@@ ing efforts of security forces , especially of domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including freedom of press , limiting , and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also campa@@ ig@@ ners , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the paper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported in Oman since its founding in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , was published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands in judicial authorities and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused , judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , issued by ISS before the special department and de@@ tained at his arrival by the security guards . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS took the deputy chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j which acts as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; the paper was concluded at an in@@ definite period after the information of the information of the paper had given that &quot; &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in the trial . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and or@@ da@@ ined the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced among other things because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a public pro@@ hibition and breach of judgment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of adhesi@@ on and pur@@ ging in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine penalty in the amount of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of a information network for the distribution of material which could pose a danger to public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was set in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
the Appe@@ al Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the promise of his six @-@ month imprisonment .
&quot; the Appe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Information Department , to conclude the paper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to be exposed as before attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information Finance was issued a directive on which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Finance signed another directive on which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; extended three additional months and thus the Minister committed another time to the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to release the paper again . &quot;
the continued closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman this press freedom was injured .
&quot; further violations include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to put their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continued closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist , Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are not yet ready to prepare an end to the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is calling for the German authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditionally release ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , to allow their journalists to work their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the press in the countryside and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman maintain their legal human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including geri@@ atic har@@ ps . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia . figure is done with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all mentioned . this is a growing area which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on site @-@ run medical research there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tubercul@@ osis and malaria in the poorest countries have far considerable effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment in research on these diseases are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves , under construction of its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors , Director of the centr@@ ist centre at the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic of the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself led the HIV virus even before it decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media concerning this research . &quot;
( disclaim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors talks as private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors R@@ W : at the moment I focus on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current research themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no fundamental research . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always remain a benefici@@ ary instead of being m@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are handled differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because the financing and development of development are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have previously ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not match the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; r@@ w : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and communic@@ able diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe us the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; r@@ w : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the ag@@ grav@@ ating access to scientific expertise that are challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that perio@@ dic@@ als can only make available to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , is also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers can change global food production &quot;
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the site En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been active in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that is grown by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in outer space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; nearly 20 years of work , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was made only by his own resour@@ ce@@ fulness and the question of how many Sal@@ at@@ ars it can get borders . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more sal@@ aries were patented and that he could not continue to use them . &quot;
&quot; patents have not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resili@@ ence against diseases , a special red or green leaf@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or cardboard boxes . due to these trends , plant breeding , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts have become food security around the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton continues to be salad , but it is now longer needed , as its work is still further ag@@ grav@@ ated by ever more restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a b@@ oul@@ der , in order to p@@ addle me . &quot;
&quot; so we need to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand in court , no one can breed more of a new species of salads , because all the features are already patented . so it is as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ving to use no material which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the US and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Center ISS have cultivated red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the sort of Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse . &quot; there is tested if plants are grown in space .

&quot; it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like this , as if the movement comes from the IT area and not out of the field of plant breeding . &quot;
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyrighted software .
&quot; it was called into life , in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit to that others can use the seeds free of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and buy it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed so their own varieties , and it does not immediately agree - two aspects that may be prohibited or prescribed by many plants . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed , and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to it , seed plays an important role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified crops .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible .
&quot; the members of the open source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing other to their seeds on the other , so that its way in contrast to patent seeds and plant features . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered , since the available gen@@ pool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always more restricted , inc@@ ess@@ antly shr@@ ink . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doc@@ torate with gene@@ tically variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features as intellectual property is protected as intellectual property either not or can be ag@@ grav@@ ated either . &quot;
&quot; there are such estimates still not , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented in still larger style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bred as they have targeted features - of those , by which their taste or colour improves up to those , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties show that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is decreasing through more and more patents . genetic diversity is more than ever before , since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto @-@ Spre@@ e@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial to Monsanto &apos;s activities . with a total of four central banks and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of United States , the company will set itself the company for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it believes that intellectual property is other breeders . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come along with another method of the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection inhi@@ bits innovations not , but also encourages them to be made available to the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks at the other : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ire , but certainly not innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long for it to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; but the main one for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and to continue to stay : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives for us are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
that is what drives us and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources .
&quot; altogether , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ es with the concept of itself , plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics really . &quot;
&quot; the plants do they form themselves , and as a bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is a sort of art , and its own values in it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation , her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed to grow into his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly mat@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such , who are moving on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are ) patents , create it the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both . &quot;
the independent plant engineer Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden salad .

&quot; in addition , Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plants of innovative would be : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than firms that pat@@ rons . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material to my catalogue , since I know my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it quite simple for my opinion . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre is leading for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to obtain the seeds of traditional farm plants , the centre with farmers work together and helps to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and to sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country who cannot simply be transferred to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be patented , and thus it speaks itself against the current practice of the European Patent , which is allowed patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to find something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , that the organisation currently uses a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled next year of the official start . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on a seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - to make a report on seeds , to exchange and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured by food . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si to see him more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially respected where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make the people clear that even more behind their foods lies . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government passed the website of the German Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it . &quot;
&quot; on August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities cri@@ tici@@ zed on this step sharp@@ ly and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the German Network for Human Rights Information will lead , despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities , to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been so important to overcome these goals , so it was never so important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I has never been so important to overcome the blocking or not . we insist on doing our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities have blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ azeera due to alleged &quot; &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he does not write on @-@ day websites and media for in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog , which he was established to b@@ ypass the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ gers , the provider of which is native to the capital blog , is on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , while he reported on the Student@@ en@@ protests and a video , how the police force physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article deals primarily about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada spoke to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
&quot; the blogs to lock blogs is very old , but has given priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege , a arrest , a trying murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used to get it to the post of articles in order to handle the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ te go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this provided technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blocking of vendors , through the evasion of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June 1992 we noticed how the blocking of web pages , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content , and filter to access the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation in addition is thereby exac@@ erb@@ ated that the decisions will be made behind closed doors , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using the court against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; the newspapers for day report newspapers in Brazil with whis@@ per@@ ing head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of the head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; each second day is assass@@ inated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es cr@@ ashes with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
&quot; the Brazilian government of Global Justice , even called the United Nations , interv@@ ene . &quot;
reports such as these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local paper .
&quot; the Editorial &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; published on 16 August the Editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced , a new column called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that occur in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex break , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; ( ... ) This is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as a journalist do not include our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inter@@ nal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the Editorial writes the newspaper further :
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ crete if it is distorted , also , atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to do . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; war &quot; more than it def@@ ends ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil argued the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was their opinion a justification of failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account of the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as an extra during the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ bog@@ gan@@ ing neglect of public service . &quot;
to the memory : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is false , according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , according to statistics from 2015 to the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we watch the M@@ ord@@ rates a federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; writes it . &quot;
&quot; specially owned by the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repeatedly stressed for years the policy of policy . &quot;
&quot; to this security policy measures also included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in the 2003 police unit , whose aim is to conquer , through the use of a massive police force for fav@@ ela and to stationary a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , U@@ PP led the U@@ PP on rails and repression against poor communities who should actually protect the newly established police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to - by the Geneva Convention established - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for the people to themselves . &quot;
&quot; for this calls on the state to use the means and routes that are typical of a war . in addition , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp spot in the landscape and the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; irr@@ ated balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continues to suffer . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police er@@ kl@@ om@@ ous the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to tra@@ itors the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident occurred : an orch@@ ard died as a result of nuts , who had fired the police of a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screenshot of the advertisement video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib is currently about a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; particularly strongly affected is the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 took the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of investigations on the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime was practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these experts have been controlled by rebels from Damascus under si@@ ege , which led the population to smug@@ gled or smug@@ gled food through tun@@ nels or stri@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional food like meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics represent the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near and execute the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the conventional in Syria &apos;s herbal foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . but their food does however make it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
&quot; the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years now , to announce this project , and expressed his relief that there is now more and more &quot; more publi@@ city . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families to plant@@ ing mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel can be used locally made from plastics , to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began using the &quot; &quot; production from the regions of the region &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; subsequently they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they designed a &quot; cur@@ riculum for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the human health breeding for various reasons : break@@ age of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by the eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee boards , cart@@ on , etc ) to attrac@@ ting new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege becomes visible .
we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis @-@ areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of capitals in Portugal and called fairness for the victims of the fires , which in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured due to forest fires on 15 and 16 October . this led the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires also were registered in the Gal@@ icia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were over 500 fire@@ break@@ through@@ s that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million acres of woods and numerous villages .
&quot; in June occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande has a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European for@@ estry system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recording , are burned alone in Portugal around 500@@ .000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
&quot; for this , you can make a better picture of the severity of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts . &quot;

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better rewards and fight measures by the state .
&quot; the people asked , why the civil protection was not able to com@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible &quot;
João Sover@@ al by the Con@@ federation of Portugal said the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
on this Sunday they did not do this from nowhere : there are dirt reports of open roads enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy took place in June as the streets were very late locked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building claims are inter@@ viewed with high brands of bran@@ ching . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government to serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was adopted by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led an attrac@@ ting of the law , which allowed the suff@@ oc@@ ation of case permitted by means of the applic@@ ant about means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; leads João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made it aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of light burning wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continues to spread over in a vi@@ cious circle . &quot;
&quot; these problems arise that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as citizens seeking information or trying to contact members , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which cat@@ ered the people with information : it used the own civilian protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire fighting and became so decisive on this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , didn &apos;t count the website more than half a million acc@@ ord . &quot;

&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings , who had survived the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; just at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in T@@ af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not so , she didn &apos;t know that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
at dawn the boy should break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

the Taliban came closer to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban for their hatred .
many Haz@@ ara settled the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mor@@ tar , which were more difficult than he himself to make his livel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; back then as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was marked by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , A@@ shar@@ k was reminded of an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we do not spend at night .
after four years A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the trip to Europe .
&quot; at the dangerous crossing in the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum , A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ op@@ los , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in Parks and went to a church , who distributed twice a day food to needy people . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high quality quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for ex@@ pi@@ ous asylum seekers . it is true also that the conditions , the asylum seekers can be found in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is the impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able personnel .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to an recording center , if they officially put an application on asylum - what can go on after reg@@ ister@@ ing the asylum system . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ k .
but his unconscious vi@@ ro@@ ment helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of soon from these conditions .
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this went so well , that after a while , he opened a second hostel for a while . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; &quot; behind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , the movie received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ an companies have emerged , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some African restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entre@@ preneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua up the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals submit far beyond the Italian food commercial trade and retail and aim back to the country , which he had to leave in a teen@@ ager as teenagers . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country and I cannot live happily , if I know my people suffers . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of the society and must get the same possibilities as any other .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also protects plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; this way , they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entre@@ preneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament scrut@@ iny a bill , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a governmental authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to use to use the social networks , within six months after the successful bill of legislation on the website of the authority under indication of its full name and number . &quot;
&quot; those who fail this step may be condemned to up to six months of prison sentence , or the end of a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was advertised by sixty parliam@@ ent@@ arians , is under the legislative acts as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
may a further member of the legislation passed a law proposition in which the tough@@ er sentences would be introduced to the approval of the President or of a high officials .
&quot; among Egyptian right is the ins@@ ult of the President as well as state institutions already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the law proposition , such a act would be punished with prison and money pun@@ ched , so far right wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can be up to three years imprisonment for the divisions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; an striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who photographed the Egyptian poli@@ cem@@ an , while she was demonstrating violence against protesters , which led to the military coup of Muhammad Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting as more than 700 protesters , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in detention awaiting a court @-@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison guide to human rights groups failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened the death penalty because of a , so many human rights groups agree with the burden of weapons , illegal assembly , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who also had been arrested for the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists lead to sc@@ anned documents
may Tunisian authorities six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been sent to a &quot; &quot; de@@ ed action plan &quot; &quot; by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , explicitly supported a controversial bill of law , the business@@ men and the former regime by dict@@ ated officers of am@@ nesty , in so far as all these un@@ justi@@ fiable money would give back money . &quot;
&quot; this published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , thro@@ ws a light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation will look like . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunisian freedom of press which journalists guarantees the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he stood in the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may , as witness in the event . &quot;
will China impose the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the state Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the regulations , it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name . &quot;
analy@@ st assume that this should be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media , to en@@ force these regulations only in order to protect the citizen journalism and its independence . &quot;
let &apos;s see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may cens@@ ored the state cens@@ orship of Russia the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or failed we@@ ave , to register with the provincial government as an &quot; organizer of the information spread . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organise a list of online services provided by the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to make them responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently part of websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ n@@ anim@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and used other services . &quot;
Turkish dish features blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish dish ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information that Turkey endor@@ se the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been locked , the side was blocked because it works for &quot; an information source meeting with groups to send a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey blocked the website completely . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can not stop her@@ nia
&quot; following this week , the government of Britain is in the midst of targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance services , the Internet service provider would force to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs , de@@ cryp@@ t the data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation does not work until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be re@@ directed to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
